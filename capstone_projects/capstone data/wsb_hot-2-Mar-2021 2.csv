The SEC can use talk like that to investigate this sub, as well as you. Why? Because that’s stock manipulation.

Now, “Be excellent to each other.” “Party on dudes!”

**An Edit for those missing my point:**

The SEC likely wouldn’t investigate or prosecute anyone. The point of this post is, they absolutely would go and get this wonderful place, full of retardation and loss porn, removed from Reddit. That’s all I aim to prevent. I’d rather not see the community go up in smoke, just because a few dozen people don’t know how their words can have consequences on more people than just themselves."
11,11,Recap for Today... GME,2021-03-02 05:05:55,"First let me just say, HOLY SHIT. What a fucking rollercoaster ride. We opened near $105 and closed at $120.40. We are progressing so much quicker than I had anticipated and soon will reach our goal BUT that is contingent upon people believing in this company and its vision for the future.

To all the 🌈🐻 out there still shilling. We understand you've lost so much money with those puts and all I can say is LOL.

But seriously, get off your high horse and look at the bigger picture here. There's no point anymore in trying, the data is clear, GME is continue to rise and no matter how many puts you place, how many shares you short, you can't win.

For the rest of my 💎 ✋ this is make or break for the rest of the ordinary people out here. We either go down in history as fucking legends who shook Wall Street with the sounds of our newly paid off Lambo exhausts or we go straight to the welfare line.

No matter what happens, I'm glad to be in the fight with you all.

I’ve been super stoked about Mama Kelli’s start, I think we can start expecting some substantial moves in GameStop’s org structure with Mama Kelli at the helm. Every customer is gonna feel so serviced even boomer Sherman can get a chub.

18,18,GME Direct Correlation: Crossing Option Strike Price and Immediate followup volume,2021-03-02 00:31:19,"We can all agree that most technicals are out the window. Track your MA's and MACD all you want, but unless you're day trading that ain't doing shit to tell this story right now. Today I've seen a whole new wave of people dropping pure misinformation and demonstrating an overall lack of understanding in the most basic of trading knowledge (people excited that calls expired ITM on a Monday... I'm looking at you). Instead of shunning these people away or. making them feel dumb, I wanted to take an abstract look at how this general idea could actually be a positive indicator.

I don't know shit about finance or anything along those lines, but I like looking at numbers. If you like numbers, this is for you. If you're looking for advice... I have none to offer at all.

So anyway... most people are in general agreement that the spike last week has covered by MM delta hedging. The price movement started right when the price hit $55:

https://preview.redd.it/pnhp2zkjeik61.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1308265360d3f9fea21087dd6c04df4e4f12fe7

Looking at the options chain last week (keep in mind, these numbers were taken right before close and will exclude any contracts exercised prior), there were a total of 18,610 contracts ITM at $55, or 1,861,000 shares. The volume in the proceeding 5 minutes jumped to over 4,000,000 shares.

The movement that lead up to closing saw the price touch $90. Looking at the open interest of contracts with strikes of $56 to $90, we have an additional 22,148 contract ITM (2,214,800 shares). The next candle following this trigger jumped to a volume of 18,000,000. Looking at the chart, this pattern continues with a larger-than-normal spike following each new milestone/strike price (until Friday, that is). Although a good portion of the volume was renewed hype and FOMO (with some institutional assistance al a Bruce's thesis), this is a steady pattern that indicates hedging of some degree on Wednesday and Thursday.

Now the fun part you smooth brains have been waiting for. Today, we saw similar action at $120 - once it held on the candle for a moment, there was an immediate spike to >2m in volume. At $120, there are 29,960 contracts ITM (2.9m shares).

Looking at the data from last week and this week, we see that those spikes correlate directly to the number of ITM contracts, using 2/24 as an example:

https://preview.redd.it/47fops6seik61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=99e443a21e5f186dc6b2bc30e63d98b6e83ccd04

I'll admit, this is very speculative. Although it is data driven, the sample size is too small and my patience is too thin. But using these jumps as a point of reference... we may know where to expect algo driven volume...

To recap real quick, with today's close at $120 there are 29,960 weekly contracts ITM. You'll notice these spikes correlated with 3000+ jumps in ITM open interest, meaning we'd see a spike if we cross $125 heading to $130... **OH. WAIT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.**

Crossing this strike price directly corresponds with the jump in volume from 680k to 2.8m (again)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cspssj72fik61.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d1be76bb8607d752917c8ae8ec9129ce11cd461

https://preview.redd.it/b5t30f9yeik61.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd3ddd5af45d46eb565b32f6f0f8bfa20a67214e

**This means the next algo-driven hedging will happen on a small scale from $135-$145** (where there are an addition \~2000 contracts)... however, **THIS WILL PUSH IT TO $150**. At $150, there are another 4,000 contracts that would be ITM. Using the very smooth brained math from our table above, this would give us a 150-200% boost in volume as the $150's are hedged. Keep in mind, we'll already be at higher volume from the $140 run, so that moment will be something to behold.

**TL;DR** MY THEORY: Organically reaching new ITM strikes causes algo based hedging and an immediate spike in volume proportionate to the number of new ITM calls. Also, the domino theory is correct - based on hedging volume surrounding additional ITM options, breaking $140 should propel it to $150 which will be like dropping a match in a puddle of rocket fuel.

This isn't actual DD. Just my ADHD medication making me sexually attracted to numbers, and it helps when people watch.

Edit- spelling

ETA - I think this reflects a change in strategy overall. While this could still overlap with what some call a gamma squeeze (t+2 covering of the previous week’s ITM calls), I think they are hedging up front more aggressively... giving us Delta Squeezes instead."

23,23,The industry players again GME,2021-03-02 12:03:24,"Thought I would have a quick run through of the mid February 13F's to see who has the big positions against GME. Here is the list if anyone is interested, it covers everyone with positions over $30m. I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere, but wanted to make sure (as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself). As always, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

>It is said that if you **know your enemies** and **know** yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not **know your enemies** but do **know** yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not **know your enemies** nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.

&#x200B;

This then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME. Surprise, it's all the same people, guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story. Thing is, even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, some of these guys have very big positions against.

Biggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there. These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category.

If you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up, just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations. What you have got remember, is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions, the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect. Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge.

You also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there, mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful.

If you can't be bothered to look at the information below, the big bosses are Melvin, Citadel and Susquehanna (SIG). I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna (SIG) might be the final boss. Guess what? Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel. Let me share with you this line from wikipedia about them,

&#x200B;

>Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture. The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on decision making under conditions of uncertainty. SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool. The company employs Bill Chen, a World Series of Poker star, in its quantitative trading group

33,33,$RKT - CEO Forcing Shorts to Pay for Their Own Squeeze by 3/9,2021-03-01 14:52:37,"So **$RKT** CEO Jay Farner fuckin hates shorts almost as much as we do, and im going to outline what this absolute **CHAD** has planned for them.

His company RKT mortgage literally smashes every ER by a country mile and hes tired of his stock being held down by these spineless cowards. [Farner is actively going to war with them Elon style.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-ceo-not-stock-174605720.html)

Let me outline how this mega-autist CEO is going to force the **shorts to squeeze themselves by 3/9.**

Farner, along with company founder Dan Gilbert, and the leadership team own 95% of Rocket Companies.

* Theres currently 113m shares outstanding
* 38% of those shares are short
* CEO/Founder own 95% of the 2B float ( note this for later )

So a quick math lesson tells us:

38% of 115m = \~ 43 mm shares short

**NOW THE FUN PART**

In their most recent investor meeting team $RKT rolled up to the shorts door like the dancing pallbearers and introduced a $1.11/share SPECIAL DIVIDEND to be paid to anyone holding RKT stock by 3/9.

So.. what does this mean for shorts? Weve arrived at the BDE moment..

**SHORTS HAVE TO PAY THE DIVIDEND**

Shorts have to pay $1.11 for every share they are short on 3/9

BUYBACK PROGRAM

What else was in that juicy investor conference? Wait for it…

**$1 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK PROGRAM**

See, RKT makes so much fucking money they can afford not only a special divi, but a $1B share buyback. Im telling you this man is going into the trenches and clearing the shorts out by his fucking self.

**TLDR:**

$RKT has been suppressed for way too fuckin long, the company owns 95% of the shares and Jay Farner/Dan Gilbert hate shorts and they have diamond fuckin nuts, they aint sellin. Shorts have to cover their 43mm shares or they are **forced to pay $1.11/share they are short on 3/9**.

Also, if you can’t do math. If u buy shares and hold thru 3/9.. it’s an instant 5% return via the special dividend."

36,36,The most valuable stock you’ll ever own is your own brain. Don’t ruin it with a gambling addiction.,2021-03-01 14:50:08,"I see the situation as being this: 

Hedge funds band together and manipulate the market, in a “legal” way, they’ve been doing it since 1999,

Now with social media, a bunch of redditors can get together and and form their own democratized hedge fund, to get in on the action basically

And we are winning.

HOWEVER,

I see a problem in that unlike the hedge fund managers, we are personally invested in our portfolios.  This is not just a number on a spreadsheet to many of us, it’s a house, it’s a car payment, it’s insurance...  We have a lot riding on this.

I am very fortunate that I am only investing in this as a game and I don’t need to win money to pay off debts or feed myself, but I still found that when my $220 turned into $4k, it was a very very visceral experience.  It was well all I could think about that entire day and night, even into the next morning.  

Maybe you see where this is going.  I believe the truth is that we are doing a good thing, we are swindling the swindlers, and it feels damn good, BUT, and I don’t mean to poop on everyone’s party, I can only see this as having a bad ending, where people put lots and lots of money in and they eventually change the rules so that we can’t win anymore and we’d have to move onto the next thing, and the hedge funds will be fine and go back to scamming America while a lot of us who can’t afford to lose much lose all their money and now have an expectation that the stock market will spit out crazy returns, which it won’t.

The big institutions have always made the majority of their money by preying on everyday Americans instincts to buy and sell, they make money off of the activity, it doesn’t matter if it goes up or down really, they just try to sucker as many people as possible into putting as much money into stocks so they can make money off commissions, fees etc.

Heed this warning please, don’t get caught up in the dopamine loop, don’t get left with an addiction in the stock market.  In the long term your mental health is much more important than any returns, the money is just the points in the game, your brain is your seat of consciousness through which you interpret everything, it’s a shitty shitty trade to trade one ounce of mental well-being for any amount of money really."

43,43,"RKT - compelling options chain, $1b buyback, great earnings, lots of short interest, and more.",2021-03-02 00:22:53,"Disclaimer: I actually know nothing about this company, what they do, or who they are. Not financial advice.  Position: 50 x $26 3/19

This stock caught my eye a few days ago. It's got a lot going for it, and I think it's going to go critical soon. Or, maybe not. But I'm riding this fucking rocket and here's why you might want to as well:

* **They apparently crushed earnings.** I don't give a shit about earnings or fundamentals. If you care about this, search around and find out.
* **The options chain screams ""gamma ramp""**, and time is actually on its side. The amount of shares MMs need to buy to maintain their delta hedge is very sizeable (more than AMC and GME, per 1% price movements).  And, critically, *charm* is positive -- meaning that delta is increasing through time. That's right. At this price, wait a day, and MMs will buy more shares to delta hedge.
* **They are buying back $1b of stock**.  That means less float. That means a lot of buying demand. supply and demand -- more demand means price go up.
* **Float is 100m, short interest is 40m, price is ramping up.** A lot of this SI isn't shitty high-entry-point short interest .. it's that's ""this stock is going sideways, let's short it"" good good. Meaning *a lot* of this SI was established at lower-than-current price points. Many shorts are underwater now.
* **This stock was, up until a couple of days ago, relatively low volatility.** I think on Friday ATM options were something like 60-80%. Now they're around 120%. That's right, it's only just now getting all meme'd up.  Increasing volatility increases the deltas on OTM calls.. meaning, yep, more delta hedging pushing the price up. If this hits meme level and IV's go to 200%+, that'll require a shit ton of shares to be purchased as a hedge.
* They announced a $1.11 dividend or some shit, which is given to whomever owns stock at close this Friday. People are claiming that will ""force shorts to cover"" or whatever. It won't. I'm ignoring the dividend because where I'm from $1.11 can't even buy a 4-piece.

**Add up all the above, and that's a ton of buying pressure for this stock**

I'll now break down each point.

# Earnings

Like I said, I have no idea what these fuckers do, who they are, or what they earn. I'm assuming they earn dollars but it could be Taco Bell gift cards for all I care.

# The Options Chain

Here is a big table of numbers. Before your brain explodes, I'll explain each column:

* **Price**:  Imagine the stock price were this value.  Ok. Now read the next bullet points.
* **# Shares DeltaHedged**: When you write an option, you want to own shares just in case it expires ITM. How many shares should you own?  Delta. It's also the probability the option expires ITM.  So you write a $30 call, and delta is .15, then you should have 15 shares.  This cell will show you how many shares are required to delta hedge *all* the open contracts.
* **# Shares DeltaHedged % float**: The above value, divided by total shares floated. The higher this is, the more shares are ""locked up"" in MMs hands.
* **1% Price Movement Delta Shares**:  Still think gamma squeezes are cool?  This is the column you care about. At this price point if the price moved up 1%, this is how much delta would increase... and thus how many shares MMs will need to buy to keep their hedge.
* **% Float**: The above, relative to float. The higher this is, the more delta-hedging should, in theory, effect the price of the stock. Think of this as ""how hard is the gamma squeeze at this price point"".  For reference, GME has these values at about 0.40%, AMC at 0.60%, and PLTR at 0.25%.
* **$ stuff**: The previous two columns, in $ form. Just for kicks.
* **24hr Charm**: Ok this is important. There are gamma squeezes. And there are also charm squeezes. As options go closer to expiry, their delta will rapidly approach either 0 (if they are OTM), or 1 (if they are ITM).  None of this fractional bullshit -- just 0 or 1. At a price point if the majority of options are ITM, it means delta will zoom towards 1 and MMs need to buy shares. If the majority of options are OTM FDs that you retards love, then MMs sit there and wait for delta to zoom to 0, and they safely dump shares they had hedged just in case your retarded FD hit the jackpot.  RKT has positive charm.  I don't even want to show you GME or AMC... but it ain't pretty.

Each time the price goes up a dollar, look how many shares need to be bought, and look at it relative to float. This is good.  Also look at how many shares need to be purchased 24hrs from now. Positive numbers are good.

(Edit: the calcs for market cap are off because yahoo data says 115m outstanding shares when really it is like 2b)

Now, I fuckin' love GME. That shit made me rich and I hold a lot of stock in it. I'm not saying it's going to drop, I'm just providing this chart as comparison.

GME also has a very good gamma ramp (~0.40% all the way up) and pretty huge inflows when price moves just 1%. But not as good as RKT.  Gamma ramps aren't necessary ""good"" or ""bad"" -- they just make it easier for the price to move because every buy/sell is in theory also copied in spades by MMs delta hedging. GME has gamma ramp in spades, because it also has a reeeaallly low *actual float* because all of us apes are holding onto shares.

Also, notice that fat negative charm. This is all of the OTM shit that is expiring soon. If the writers of these contracts delta hedged against them, all things equal they will start selling off the shares since the likelihood of them printing will approach zero.  RKT doesn't have that.  (Note: I'm long GME shares, but won't touch options bc vol is too high).

[Here are tables for GME, AMC, RKT, and CLVS](https://old.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/lv6nqc/meme_stock_update_monday_march_1_premarket/gpbcyip/) as well as a much more in depth discussion.


# Stock Buyback

I don't know much about this, but apparently they are going to buy back $1b in shares. When? I don't know. Soon hopefully? Either way, buying makes price go up and makes float go down.  When float goes down, each buy (either by you, MMs, or whoever else) should have more impact on the price.

# Short Interest

I feel like an asshole talking about short interest, because pretty much every time I read about it in a DD the person misses the point.  Short interest is only half the story -- the other half is *the price point that short interest was opened at* as well as *the underlying assumptions of the stock*.

**Price point of short interest**

Imagine you short sell a shit ton of stock at $100.  Now it goes to $20.  Then it goes to $30. And you hear people screaming: ""there is so much short interest! shorts are in trouble!!!"".  Would you, with your massive cock, be afraid when you're already up $70/share?  Do you feel compelled to cover anytime soon, or will you just watch idiots pile on and eventually paper hand? Probably worth shorting more at the little peak there, too.

Most of the time, it's pretty hard to tell when short interest was added. However, **not this time**.  We can see that short interest was added while the stock was trading sideways since Sept 2020.

What was short interest then, in Sep 2020?  **16.83m**.

What is short interest now? **45m**

**That means 30m shares were shorted at a price point between $20 - $24.  They are underwater, for sure.**

What are they going to do? As discussed, the gamma ramps are so fucking juicy that as they cover (buying shares) their buys will be mirrored by MMs causing the price to go up even further. At this point they are walking on fucking eggshells and I love it.

Now, this isn't a MOASS or even a ""big"" short squeeze... but it's 30m shares on a stock that sees a daily average of 
11m/day, and 30m/day on a huge day like today.  So I think the squeeze is good for at least $5-10 in price action.  Total ballpark guess pulled out of my ass, do not quote me on it... but that's how I'm playing it.

# Mispriced Volatility

This one is going to require more wrinkles. Up until a few days ago, this stock had a low IV, justifiably so. It was trading sideways for months, and nobody gave a shit about it. 

What's that mean? It means whoever was shorting it probably did not plan on it ever spiking like it is currently. That means they probably had less hedges in place, and may now start to realize they are overleveraged.  Did the shorts entering since Sept have any idea that the market would change to the fucked up retail casino that it is now, where a pack of wild apes can just pile on to a stock just because some dude writes a shitty DD on some subreddit full of retards, causing it to 2x in a matter of days for no real reason other than gambling on OTM options is fun and the ticker is RKT?  Probably not.

**The shorts may have perceived this as a low-volatility stock and positioned themselves as such.**

Low volatility also means that options were ""cheap"" -- so there are a fuck ton of them open right now.

Now the crucial point. As volatility increases, the deltas on OTM options increase. That's right, an *increase in volatility can cause a gamma squeeze*.

When I bought options on Friday the IV was like 60-80% or something. I really wish I had loaded up more... I would have if I had made my options chain chart by then.  Anyway, now, IVs for the same options are 125%.  I'm sure they'll pop even more tomorrow.

What's that mean? It means if you wrote options that had a delta of .1 on Friday, and they now have a delta of, say .2 tomorrow, it's time to buy 10 more shares per contract. Except, wait, you wrote something like 100,000 of those options...

# Dividend

I've seen some posts hyping up the dividend. ""Shorts will have to cover!!"" and ""free money!!"".  Ok, listen up. Dividends don't do jack shit here. They aren't good, and they aren't bad.

First of all, 40m shares x $1.11 is like $44m.  Imagine you have a position worth about a billion dollars, and somebody says to you: ""You can either cover at a huge loss, or you have to pay $44m"" -- which are you going to pick?  $44m is fucking nothing compared to the value of the position.

Second of all, it's not free fucking money. Stock prices go down when they issue dividends. Look at any stock with a dividend on the date it's issued. It goes down because the company's cash balance goes down by the distribution amount.

Am I worried about the price dropping for RKT?  Fuck no. $1.11 is nothing compared to the recent price action, and the sheer amount of shares that need to be delta hedged on a continuous basis, especially more so if the price goes up.

# Other shit

I recommend searching the ticker on wsb for more info about the actual company and why others are bullish. Like I said, I don't give a fuck what these guys do.  Just ignore anybody talking about how the dividend forces shorts to cover. They are retarded like me, but more.

[Click here you lazy retard.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=rkt&restrict_sr=on&t=week)

# What to do

Not financial advice. But look for the lowest IV options anywhere from $20 - $30, expiring next week or a month or two. Play it safe.  Keep a pulse on it and sell as it spikes and as IV becomes ludicrous.  Save some for YOLO.

I have no price target. I just know this thing has to pop sooner or later and probably go back down to it's comfort zone plus a little no-longer-supressed-by-short-interest premium. So, maybe it'll get to $28 comfortably?

Guessing prices is not my forte. I enter into positions and exit them slowly when shit goes my way... occasionally letting house money ride into the valhalla or the graveyard.

Also, keep a close eye on the Ortex Short Interest numbers. As shorts start to cover, it might be time to exit. Or you can let it ride and hope that the gamma ramps keep propping up the price. Just know at some point it will have to revert to some new average price.

# Conclusion

So that's my DD. What I like:

* an options chain formed when volatility was low, with a shit ton of delta hedging going to be required if IV goes up, and if/when it moves up dollar by dollar
* short interest that was established at a known price that is underwater
* a ticker named RKT, for fucks sake

Lastly, I'm sorry I did not write this sooner. I dipped my toes in on Friday off of other DD that was good (except for the dividend ""shorts must cover"" bullshit).  Then I did my whole options chain table producing thingy and noticed how superior the gamma ramp and charm was for this ticker vs [some other beloved meme stocks](https://old.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/lv6nqc/meme_stock_update_monday_march_1_premarket/gpbcyip/)."

If the calls are already covered then there's no additional buying of shares, so no gamma squeeze...

Actually, market makers often create options contracts without having purchased the shares yet.  They wait to purchase them either when you first buy the option or at the time you exercise it.  

Like a chef's menu, just because it's on the menu doesn't mean the chef has made it.  The chef makes it when its ordered.   

Gamma squeezes happen because the more call options purchased the more meals the chef has to make, either now or when I show up later at my scheduled time to pick up my food.  Buying calls actually does increase buying shares because the MMs buy them when their calls are sold.

A number of you autists have seen my DD on RKT in the past few days.

It is my opinion that the key lies with the **resistance at $26**.

# Introduction

Over  the past month, I've been researching stock prospects that I can buy  into for 2021. The pandemic hit everything really hard, and now we are  looking at a potential recovery going into 2021. We saw a huge dip in  the market last week despite **GME** and **AMC**  surging big-time. We've been watching the market do a ton of swings,  with Marijana stocks surging briefly, then dying off, and now there's  been a huge sell-off in the Tech sector--I believe because the market is  transitioning to the Travel sector and not necessarily because of anything fundamentally wrong with the Tech sector.

Coincidentally,  I've also been doing a lot of research into the housing market because I  am looking to move this year into a new home, thanks to the blessing of a well-paying job that allowed me to work from home throughout the pandemic. I noticed some significant trends and parallels with major,  historic economic events that are going to change the landscape of our  economy for decades. In summary, I believe we are on the cusp of a new house market collapse that will mirror and possibly overshadow what we experienced in the 2008 Sub Prime Mortgage crisis.

If you are a well-versed ape who knows their shit when it comes to the  American housing market and how it affects the economy, feel free to skip all this history and go find the stock picks that you can start drawing your green crayon charts with.

# Important References

**The major economic events I am referencing that are most relevant to my research are as follows:**

* The Great Depression (A.K.A. GD)
* Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933 (which pulled us out of it)
* The New Deal's Wagner-Steagall Housing Act of 1937 (Also helped in the recovery)
* The Great Recession of 2007
* The Sub-Prime Mortgage Crises of 2008
* The Recession Scare of 2016

# Great Depression & and the Covid 2019 pandemic

**This part is going to be a long analysis on past events on the history of  American Economy in support of this analysis. If you don't care about it  or already know, skip it.**

The most significant economic event in US history was The Great Depression (GD) which began in 1929. Most people don't really understand the real cause.  The main trigger of the GD was that growing industries at  that time which focused on the manufacturing of cheap goods and had historically (at that time) performed really well, were suddenly starting to suffer from consumer lag, meaning nobody was buying their products. Despite this, stocks in many consumer goods and luxuries continued to rise, and the ""Roaring Twenties"" had an overwhelming feeling of optimism. The average debt of American citizens was rising as we began to widely adopt a culture of buying on credit, something we still do heavily today. When people fall into debt, they tighten their belts and stop buying frivolously in order to save money for the essentials.

The Crash finally happened on ""Black Tuesday"" because Wall Street realized that the optimism of the market was no longer feasible, and began selling off shares in huge numbers. Margin buyers (those who buy stocks on credit)  snapped up the ""opportunity"" and basically borrowed the shares with money they could not afford.

Suddenly,  on October 29th, the floor fell out beneath the entire market, and anyone buying on margin was completely wiped out. Consumer debt went through the roof, and everyone scrambled to pull their money out of the banks in order to hold onto what cash they had ... all on the same day.

The banks' vaults were completely wiped out, and when people could not withdraw their money because there was none to withdraw, and the banks could not call in on the debts of people because the banks themselves had no funds to transfer. The entire economy collapsed instantly.  Companies could not afford to buy materials on credit, meaning they could not do business. Businesses closed, and hundreds of thousands of  Americans became jobless overnight, and this was only in the first few months. Homelessness became rampant as hundreds of thousands of  Americans defaulted on their mortgages in the following years. This will be important later.

# How the Covid Pandemic Compares to the Great Depression

**The Covid Pandemic is an exact replica of the events preceding the GD**, but simply masked by different causes. Because of the Covid Pandemic, over 500,000 Americans are dead, mostly seniors, and [unemployment has completely skyrocketed](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R46554.pdf) beyond 14.8% (as of April 2020), though it finally calmed down to roughly 6.7%, though the accuracy of that information is shakey at best because it does not include people who have stopped looking for jobs or have fallen out of the sight of the statistics because they have been rendered homeless.

**The  Covid 19 pandemic essentially triggered a massive and instantaneous halt on consumer spending because so many Americans have lost their jobs--the same trigger that caused the GD. The reason this  has not led to a complete collapse of the economy is because of two  reasons:**

1. **The  Stimulus Package released last year was almost entirely directed towards businesses in order to prop up the economy. Despite the fact that 20% of Americans are delinquent on rent, and 32% of Americans are late on mortgage payments a vast majority of the stimulus went into businesses and investors that would inject the money into the stock market.**
2. **The moratorium on rent, federal student loans, and mortgage payments, has given Americans a brief respite to recover in the wake of an unprecedented unemployment crisis as a direct result of the pandemic.  The money from the stimulus SHOULD have gone to these individuals so they could pay their rent and utilities to avoid an inevitable housing crisis, this action is basically a crutch holding up Americans while they accumulate a massive amount of debt on rent and utilities that they will never be able to pay back. When the moratorium ends, it will be a complete catastrophe.**

# Crawling out of depression via mortgages and bonds

**Skip this if you don't care about how important mortgages and bonds are to the US economy**

The  US in the 1930s under Franklin D. Roosevelt took massive steps to rebuild the American economy using Mortgages as the foundation of it. [The Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeowners_Refinancing_Act)  enabled the American public to secure their homes by using the federal government as the backer for thousands of mortgages, which guaranteed financial security for the banks. This allowed the banks to give the average American the credit to afford a home and secure employment with affordable refinancing. By the mid 1930s, 20% of urban America successfully refinanced their homes, and the depression began making its turn-around. Basically, all of America now relies on mortgages as a  sign of economic health, which became the start of the real ""American  Dream"" of owning a home in the 1950s and persists today.

Another way we crawled out was because of US Treasury Bonds, and *ironically* thanks to World War II. Selling bonds is how the US Treasury builds capital to fund huge policies. The prime example of this was the mass sale of **War Bonds** during World War II, which **helped contribute to our pulling out of the GD**. As soon as we went to war in 1941, [more than 80 million Americans purchased war bonds to bring in $180 Billion in revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warbonds.asp) instantaneously.

# What is a bond? How does it work?

Bonds are essentially an investment in the US government and are generally considered safe. When you buy a 5 year bond say at $100 at a 2% yield,  the bond pays you back 2 dollars for each year you hold the bond. Bonds are ""generally"" safe because they don't lose their value; however, in cases where inflation goes through the roof, bonds ""lose"" money because inflation outpaces the rate of return on the bond. If in 2 years,  inflation rises by 6% when the rate of return of my bond is 2%, then I  basically lost 2 dollars in the exchange of my bond. This usually doesn't happen, and supposedly American inflation is secure, but that remains to be seen.

In any case,  when bonds are the better pick, the stock market usually halts, which is what happened back during World War II; however, this was because  America pulled together to fight what they believed to be the greatest evil of their time. Even Wall Street got a piece of it, and because of that historical trend, when bonds go up, stocks go down. The reason this happens is that when bond yields go up significantly, investors tend to choose bonds because they are safer. That being said, the market reaction to the bond yield rising is pure speculation and unlikely to indicate the market is failing *so far*, but it DOES signal what the US Government is trying to do.

Recently,  the stock market has been flying high because of the monetary injections from the stimulus. Everyone is feeling REALLY excited, or they have been up until recently. The market took a HUGE dip on Thursday  (25th) as a result of news that US Treasury Bonds had increased their yield percentage.

# The problem with bonds today and the economic debt situation

Confidence in the US Government is generally not good right now. Our situation today is very different from 1941. Presently, civil unrest for different reasons which we are all aware, have divided the nation, and the response from the government has not inspired much confidence.

That being said, bond sales are *extremely unlikely* to be as steady, or voluminous as they were in 1941, and that is going to force the Treasury to act more drastically in raising the yields. The stock market is going to suffer for it, probably, but more than anything the American Government is going to be setting itself up for disaster.

The US Government is increasing yields on bonds because they are preparing for an inevitable disaster where they are going to need massive amounts of capital to cover the American public when this housing crisis occurs. They would prefer to cover this expense with domestic capital rather than getting loans from its economic partners. That is because they have seen this before, but now we have the knowledge of history and the signals of an impending crisis. I mean... hell, it's obvious at this point.

The reason is that America is going to have to print HUGE amounts of money to pay back the bonds that are bought with what I think are historically higher yields than we've ever seen before. This will drive up inflation, but it would not increase the US Debt. I believe that as a  result, the US government may put in a situation where it must pay huge sums of money in order to prop up the economy as we go through the upcoming crisis, they are going to do what they have always done...

*Borrow borrow borrow*

We borrow money, mainly from European allies and China. This is having a  detrimental effect on the world's confidence in America's economy, and it is likely going to fall out eventually. In a worst-case scenario,  China may call upon America to pay back its debt, though it is unlikely because it would hurt their economy significantly as well.

Nevertheless,  China is now the forerunner of the world economy, having completely overshadowed the global market in consumer goods and manufacturing industries. They are also surging ahead in tech and healthcare/pharmaceuticals--historically US-based industries. I don't necessarily believe China would demand a payback when we couldn't possibly do it, they *may* refuse to loan more to the USA, and that will be the trigger of the crisis which I'm about to explain.

# Parallels to the Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession

**For those of you who have seen ""The Big Short"" or studied the 2008 Financial Crisis and know about this, feel free to skip.**

From  2000 to 2006, because of some highly unscrupulous actions taken by mortgage-lending banks, huge banks like Morgan Stanley and Lehman (which collapsed) accumulated a massive amount of uncovered risk in the form of ""Collateralized Debt Obligations"" or CDOs. A [CDO](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032315/were-collateralized-debt-obligations-cdo-responsible-2008-financial-crisis.asp)  is basically a package of loans that pays back premiums to investors.  In the case of the 2008 mortgage crisis, lending banks were selling massive amounts of extremely poor quality or ""Sub Prime Loans"" to people who they knew were highly likely to default (fail to pay the mortgage and lose their house). The housing market was in a huge bubble because small and mid-sized banks were willing to lend INSANE sums of money for people to buy houses. These banks would then bundle up the sub-prime loans along with really good or safe loans, known as AAA (Triple-A) or  Prime mortgages. The small banks would then sell these packages of loans for huge, lump sums to the big banks, who would assume control of the interest and premium payments in the form of a CDO, but the CDO would be marked as AAA-rated despite being made up of more than 14% of B-rated mortgages or worse.

Banks continued to do this en-masse, bundling huge amounts of bad loans, until they made up more than 14% of the CDO packages. We're talking BILLIONS  of dollars in horrendous, subprime mortgages that were almost guaranteed to fail.

By mid-2007, defaults on loans were through the roof, and more than 14% of the loans in these  CDOs were in default. People were losing their homes en-masse, and yet banks continued this terrible lending practice. Some investors took notice and began buying up short positions known as ""[Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp)""  (CDS) on these bad loans. A CDS is basically like buying insurance against a default, meaning that if the majority of these mortgages defaulted, the person who shorted them would earn a massive payout the same way you are paid insurance if your home burns to the ground.

The combination of overwhelming mortgage defaults along with the massive sums of short positions taken up against the American Housing market and the banks that facilitated it completely bankrupted some banks. In the aftermath, the stock market plummeted, bank and hedge fund managers were among over 5,000 new suicides in 2009 in the wake of the disaster that ruined them and their clients financially. The US government was forced to step in and bail out big banks like Morgan Stanley, AIG, and many others in order to prevent a total economic collapse.

As you might have guessed, average Americans never saw a penny of it.  Millions of people lost their homes, jobs, and their lives. It was an instantaneous and disastrous crisis that only could be compared to the  GD, despite how brief it was.

We are now facing an identical, inevitable, and exponentially worse scenario by September 2021...

# How the market is going to collapse by September (without intervention)

As  I mentioned in my references above, over 32% of home-owners and 20% of renters in America are delinquent on payments. Banks are already feeling the pinch because nobody is making payments, but the government has forced them to eat it and say ""tough shit"" until the pandemic is over. [The losses are astronomical](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/14/833920538/americas-largest-bank-jpmorgan-chase-prepares-for-massive-round-of-defaults).

How  I feel personally about these banks is irrelevant, and I do think they are evil incarnate, the fact that nobody can pay their mortgages is a  REALLY BAD THING. The problem is that the government only told banks they can't force anyone to pay, nobody can be evicted, and yet the debt continues to grow.

**Without intervention, this is what is going to happen...**

When the moratorium on ~~mortgages and~~ rent finally goes, the American economy is going to collapse under the weight of displaced residents, and the stock market will see a massive pullback from the economic burden. Due to evictions, they won't be able to qualify for mortgages or homes, and rent qualifications will be just as shaky. The end-result is pretty much identical to what we saw in 2008 in terms of debt to income ratio, and the lack of secured housing for millions of Americans. Wall Street and the banks  are doing everything they can to hedge against their inevitable losses  from this, but when the defaults finally happen, we can expect more than  [9% of Americans to default](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-speculative-grade-default-rate-seen-rising-to-9-by-september-2021-8211-s-p-61424480)

>**Edit note:** I did not correctly interpret forbearance and debt accumuluation. I have come to realize that mortgage forbearance allowed home-owners to cease all payments and defer them entirely. This protection only applies to home-owners though. Renters do not have this protection, and are expected to pay back their debts in full. I still believe that many home owners on B, BB, and BBB-rated loans may have their backs broken by the pandemic regardless and still default on their mortgages. Defaults are still very high, and without intervention, this will break the back of the US economy. Thanks to the degenerates who pointed this out to me.

Unless  billions of dollars are injected into the banks in order to cover their  losses, on the condition that all delinquent American home owners and  renters are COMPLETELY FORGIVEN, this is inevitable, and it is already  affecting us.

# What the housing market is doing now and what is about to happen

The housing market has been a ""seller's market"" bubble since May. I know, because I sold my last home at a 45% profit, despite the pandemic in  September. I have been looking for a new home to move out of state since  December while renting an affordable apartment to accumulate money for a  down payment.

While doing my research on homes to move to, I watched houses in the area I was hoping to move drop by an average of 20% in asking price since January. Most American home owners aren't stupid, they know what is coming, and they know they won't be able to pay.

As of December, housing inventory was 1.06 Million homes, down from 1.5  Million in June. Everyone is currently saying ""We're running out of homes"" which has been driving the prices of homes and number of mortgages higher than ever at historically low-interest rates. In the last month, home construction costs being at relatively low prices depending on the area) have allowed property developers, especially on the west coast and rural  America to build massive amounts of single and multi-family homes averaging over $400,000 with a 15% profit margin on building costs. Land development and realty companies are looking to take advantage of the seller's market, thinking that they can build enough homes in time to sell at record-high prices. All this sounds like great things for the housing market, but it's about to all come to an end.

>***Edit Note***\*: I made statements here which implied that construction costs on new houses were down for everyone. This is not true for the average home buyer, but\* ***might*** *be true for* ***development companies*** *in areas with easy access to lumber (such as OR, WA, CA, ID, etc). I was misled based on new-home costs in these states, which have easy access to cheap lumber, despite the downturn, and new homes are being built in massive numbers. I appreciate those who pointed this error out to me.* [Some data I was linked](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST)

According to [Black Knight](https://www.blackknightinc.com/blog-posts/slowdown-in-rate-of-forbearance-improvement/),  5.2% of mortgages are in forbearance pending the end of the pandemic protections with a total of 2.7M homes facing default when the forbearance ends. Everyone of those people is going to be expected to pay back absolutely everything as soon as the moratorium ends *in full*.

The current numbers of new homes on the market is not out as of today, but based on the rate of increase from Zillow, showing an average 13.4%  increase in house prices since January to December 2020, and now  watching as the collective price of homes suddenly plummeted by 20% on  the searches I have done, I see a flood before the comet strikes and they are forced to default. The simultaneous increased home construction and the flood of homes from Americans trying to get out is going to lead to a sudden rise of (I believe) more than 3 million homes. This is going to cause  housing prices to plummet, and they already are, ahead of any data or  news.

For those Americans too slow  or unwilling to sell and cannot pay, eviction is the only alternative.  Foreclosures will flood the market, and banks will be forced to auction  at dramatically lower prices in order to avoid losing their investments  to weather damage as the houses sit empty for months or years.

This will force banks to compensate their losses with higher interest rates.  Variable-rate mortgages will feel the squeeze the hardest, and homeowners who were once paying 3% will, in another 2 years, likely see their mortgage interest increase significantly over time. People who are still facing struggles in a post-pandemic America will likely be forced to surrender their homes,  but they will get no relief from renters, as they have been put in the  same boat as the banks but without any hope of government support, as they are privately owned entities that have much less impact on the economy.

Due to the rent crisis that we are already witnessing unfold, I predict landlords will be forced to raise rent prices to recover their losses from the forbearance. Worse, many will be forced to sell their property because they have their own bills to pay and no income to do so. When rent becomes impossibly high, mortgages are unobtainable, home-owners are  forced to refinance at insane rates of interest, and the market inevitably floods with more homes at prices running away to  near-worthlessness.

# How in the F-ing hell does ANY of this awfulness have to do with stock market DD!?

**This is the section you've been waiting for**

The  pandemic has financially crippled the American economy, and the  stimulus package that was released is currently propping everything up.  In the end, I'm expecting the housing market to crash VERY Hard.  However, unlike Michael Burry, I'm taking up long positions in what I  believe are going to be very important businesses that will provide the  necessities for Americans as the crisis unfolds.

1. **Moving and Storage companies - CUBE UHAL EXR**

When  people are forced to move, the first thing they have to do is collect  their belongings and put them somewhere. This crisis is going to force  Americans to move out of their homes and apartments en-masse, and it's  going to be an absolute brutal disaster. I believe that people are  already getting ahead of this by selling off their homes, and they will  start putting their stuff into places they can afford, mobile or  climate-controlled storage units.

I  want to be clear, the idea of this is utterly depressing to me... but  the first stock that is going to skyrocket ahead of the market downturn  is moving companies, and storage units. U-Haul, owned my Amerco, does  both, and they have packaged deals. The company has done nothing but  made stupid money since it was founded post WW2. But in the years  leading up to the 2008 crisis and in the 6 years after it ended, Uhaul  made INSANELY STUPID money.

&#x200B;

[Amerco\/UHAL stock analysis & historical performance \(1995-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/qlvlfmamfik61.jpg?width=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e1d14b30c267551414bc1a6be8b57944ce5e5d)

Besides  Amerco/UHAL, EXR (Extra Space Storage) and CUBE (CubeSmart) are both  making huge moves in the market and despite being in direct competition,  typically keep to their own respective areas of the nation where they  do the most business. Because of this, they don't steal each other's  clients. Being national companies, they offer much better rates, on  average, than private/family owned storage facilities.

Since  Uhaul is the only company on this list old enough to have been a  national brand at the time of the 2008 crisis, it is the only real  litmus test I have pulled up for how the market will react and how they  will make their money. Because CUBE is much cheaper, I have thrown my  bets on them, and I anticipate good news on Monday.

>\*\*DISCLOSURE OF MY POSITIONS:\*\*  
>  
>30 Calls @ $40 (OTM) Strike expiring 3/19 for $0.15 per contract  
>  
>10  Calls @ $45 (OTM) Strike expiring 8/20 for $0.35 per contract

CUBE  announced earnings this weekend, and I'm anticipating the price to rise  sharply on good announcements that they strongly outpaced their  earnings once the transcripts go public. At any point they dip, I have  every intention to start buying up stocks, even if my calls expire  worthless. This is a very LONG play, and I do not advise anyone to copy  my trades unless you have the capital to spare. Just like UHaul in the  wake of the pandemic, they dipped HARD, but after their latest earnings  announcement, absolutely blew through the roof.

Options  on CUBE are cheap right now, and I am willing to throw $800 down on  that bet. Even if CUBE only goes up by $1 per share after earnings are  public, that's break-even for me. I'm also expecting that other  investors are going to get behind this trend and start buying up shares  in these sectors as well, ahead of a mortgage crisis.

If  I had more capital, I would throw money down on UHaul at the first sign  of a dip, but at the present, this is what I have available. I can say  the same about EXR. If I had the money, I'd diversify these calls, but I  still consider this a worthwhile risk for an initial investment. I  believe EXR has higher loss-tolerance because they have a higher market  cap and more facilities, but fundamentally, they are identical to CUBE,  with the caveat that CUBE has more facilities in high-density urban  areas on average--at least according to the research I've been able to  turn up.

Cubesmart still has solid  fundamentals, they've beat earnings expectations every quarter last  year, and had a 3% increase on dividends in December. With over a $7  Billion market cap, they have money to burn, and I think they'll come  out huge at the end of this. Even with the pandemic hurting everyone, I  am expecting a big push on Monday and the weeks to follow.

2. Cheap Goods and Wholesale $OSTK $COST $WMT $AMZN

My  pick here is Overstock ($OSTK), but Cost-Co Walmart and Amazon are  other obvious picks for people who can afford them. Sadly, a LOT of  Americans are going to be very desperate as they face homelessness and  have to bargain for essentials and cheap furniture. I don't like Walmart  or Amazon because I disagree with their business practices as a whole,  but you can't argue with their long-term performance and their success.  That being said, they're safe bets even in a post-pandemic market  disaster.

Fundamentally, I find  Overstock is WAY undervalued at $67 per share, especially at their  recent high of $102 that got rejected in August 2020. They have been  absolutely crushing expectations, and the only reason I believe they are  so undervalued is because of the stiff competition and attention  whoring of Amazon and walmart. At < $70, $OSTK is at a huge discount.  I plan on buying shares with them, since options are unpredictable.  Currently waiting on funds to settle, but I have limit positions set at  100 shares $80 limit price.

Call  options on this one are higher due to recent volatility, but OTM calls a  few months out are still cheap. Assuming the price doesn't skyrocket  (like I think it will in a couple months), and OSTK settles in at \~$80  per share, I plan on buying more share and calls as soon as the market  collapses, assuming I'm right about the housing market.

3. Travel industry $CAR $LUV $UAL

In  the wake of the pandemic, travel industry froze overnight, which caused  an immediate downturn. Nevertheless, the big names have been able to  survive all this time, and some are doing better than ever now that  restrictions have lifted and the market has shown its confidence by  buying back into $CAR (Avis budget group) and $LUV (Southwest Airlines)  hugely. I believe that $UAL (United Airlines) is lagging behind the  trend at the moment because the market is awaiting reactions to a recent  engine explosion that happened on a Boeing 777 flight. I am  anticipating that the news is going to show that Boeing is the cause for  blame, but if you are unsure, you could always do a straddle/strangle  strategy on UAL. The price is likely to move sharply in one direction or  the other, so it's a 50-50 shot. Fundamentally, UAL isn't going  anywhere, since they service tons of international and domestic flights  in the US.

The travel industry is  exploding more because of people just itching to get free and travel  again and not necessarily because of a housing market fiasco; however,  it's worth pointing out that $CAR also owns Budget Truck, which is in  the same vein as UHAL, which I've already discussed that I'm long on.

Fundamentally  ABG is a strong company that is highly diversified across rental cars,  trucks, vans, and even have rental-purchase agreements with used car  dealerships which are likely to be a huge revenue stream once their  older vehicles cycle out of their service lifetime. $CAR had to cut  almost half its workforce because of the pandemic in order to preserve  capital. They survived, and the market responded by exploding their  price to $55.55, just barely under 20% of their previous ATH of $68.89. I  expect them to continue to beat their previous performance, mainly  because most of $CAR's competition got decimated by the pandemic and  many of them still have not recovered. It's difficult to say if they  will continue to move up as sharply as they have recently, but $60 OTM  calls for 3/19 are absolutely within reason, in my opinion. These calls  are currently very cheap at $2.15/contract, but if you're risk-averse,  setting up a position to expire farther out, or simply buying a bunch of  their stock while it's still reasonably priced are both good long-term  strategies for me.

Again, I'm a  poor bitch, so I'm limited on capital and don't currently have a  position in $CAR or $LUV, but they're both my personal picks, and I hope  to place market buys as soon as my recently traded funds settle next  week.

# Closing thoughts

**I  am also paying very close attention to the overseas healthcare,  professional service, alternative energy and tech sectors, as I believe a  lot of those jobs will start heading overseas as the US economy begins  to tank. I'm looking at Japan, China, Taiwan, and Canada the closest.**

For  the record and full disclosure, I am also holding 500 shares of AMC (TO  THE MOON!!!), which I believe will reflect the sentiment of the public  ahead of travel restrictions lifting completely. If people are willing  to throw money at movie theaters, people are going to start traveling  soon after that, and the outlook is promising for that.

There  are other sectors that are likely to do well in the wake of the  upcoming economic turmoil, and you can be assured that Wall Street is  well aware of them. Even if the prediction makes me feel sick, I think  the best thing I can do, personally, is to do something to pull some  money out of this pending disaster so that I have the funds to put back  some good into the world.

I'm  looking for feedback on the DD, and I hope that I can get some other  people's opinion on whether I might be right or wrong about this. Part  of me wants to be very wrong, and I want there not to be another  economic crisis, but it feels inevitable.

**Last week re-cap**

Last week we have seen market shitting it's bed and the main reason has been the rise in yields on the long end of the yield curve. For those of you who do not know what the yield curve means, it represents the interest rate you get when you hold a constant maturity treasury securitiy (U.S. bonds). 

As an example if you hold a treasury security that pays you the face value of $1000 10 years from now, the price you pay would be discounted by 1.45% as per the 10 yr- rate today. You can see that as the rate increases, the price you pay for receiving $1000 decreases. This is the meaning for *""Bond prices go down when rates go up* "" on WSJ.  

When the yields went up last week, the prices of the bonds have come down which means that not many investors are interested to get into bonds in the coming economic environment. When do the bonds become less interesting ? well, when the value of $1000 you receive in the future is not much of a value compared to today. In short **investors are expecting that INFLATION is coming.** In an inflationary environment bonds are not valuable to hold, hence the drop in prices and the rise in yields. 

*what should be worried about inflation ? Well, our savior Lord JPoW commander of the printer has a target of 2% inflation and what happens when this target is breached ? The printer goes mute and we won't have our tendies because stonks will go down when it happens.*

Historically, rise in inflation has been marked by rise in the value of the stock market before the price inflation sets in. This has been the case in both the German Inflation (1914-1923) and the Great American Inflation in 1970's. 

**German Inflation (1914-1923)** 

Germans had to let their printer on to fund  world war 1 and also to pay for the reparations that have been levied on them after the first world war. The speed of the printer is so high that makes JPoW's eys wide open in shock. The currency depreciated from the time somone started ordering their food at at a restaurant and by the time they paid the bill.

Taming inflation has been hard as unemployement soared, government spending decreased and taxes increased. So they just let the printer on. One must beware of being a creditor whenever the governement is a debtor which means that this is the time to load up on some loans or personal debt as the amount you will be paying in the future would be worth less. Everyone who held cash has been wiped out and people who had capital assets were saved.

***At the height of the boom, stock prices soard 4 times in a span of 9 months while dividends went out of style.*** when the first upturn of price inflation showed up, the stock market crashed on Black Thursday even before any businesses had failed . We have seen a teaser of this last week when stocks across the sectors got crushed. Interestingly, stock prices fell by about 25% for over 6 months while prices of rest of the goods went up. **The inflation was so bad at the end that all the german currency till that point was not enough to buy a loaf of bread the next day**. At the end of it all Germans profited from inflation as their debt got erased. Similarly, when we see inflation in the US in the coming months/years the money that came out of the printer would be less valuable and inflation is a way for some of federal debt to get diluted.

**Fx rate indicator**

Fx rate is usually a sensitive indicator of inflation but here multiple factors that are in play at the same time. Currently, USD being the reserve currency and the increase in treasury yields will enable the flow of funds from emerging markets and elsewhere to the safe haven strenghtening the USD.

**American Inflation in the 1960's**

The story is the same here again. The printer went brrr to fund American wars in korea, vietnam and also the policies of the newly elected Kennedy administration with slogan ""get the country moving again"". Althought, the magnitude of monetary inflation is different the scale is same.  German Money supply increased by 25 times while American supply increased only 3.5 times. Accordingly, price inflation in weimer Germany went up 17 times while American inflation went up 2.5 times.

*Similar to the outages we have seen with the stock brockers, the market back then has been temporarily halted due to huge volumes and turnover which was a result of immense speculation in the stock market.*

One of the disastrous policy of that era was a tax cut amid the already huge debt that the country had ( guess you can relate to one of the huge tax cuts we had recently). The country enjoyed a great prosperity from 1962-1968 and when the Fed finally sought to stop the inflation, guess what the stock market crashed. 

When the prices went up multiple times per year, the production workers in U.S numbering around 27 million saw their wages raise around 1.9% year. you might as well relate when this  ends, which part of the economic class have been the most impacted. The inflationary boom always excludes the most numerous class from any share in its spoils. So yes this is time we make tendies.

**Why is there no inflation yet? Human behavior has been the same**

If you are thinking as the printer went brrr why don't I see a rise in prices of the goods I purchase in the market, then the answer is that there's an asset inflation that's going on and you might have to wait a while for the price inflaiton to show up. 

Anytime When the printer goes brr and the monetary inflation increases, prices will initially remain constant. Humans tend to save or either invest in assets/financial assets rather than spend it on their personal consumption. This is the reason we see the stock market at such high levels, rise in house prices, lumber prices, copper, steel and what not. Finally when the Fed realizes inflation is here and raises interest rates, stock market will go down and people will start spending that money elsewhere on real goods. That my friend welcomes you to the world of price inflation.

**Tl;DR**

Inflation is buy-now-pay-later. Historically, inflation has been preceeded by stock market boom and asset price inflaiton. With trillions of dollars of stimulus floating around, inflation will be real. Stonks won't always go up and this is the time to make our tendies. 

Bull markets rest on nothing but inflation."
71,71,"Rant for more fact based, calm and thoughtful behavior regarding GME",2021-03-01 13:19:04,"First of all, sorry for my German potato English. I am relatively new to this retarded sub, started lurking in it around December 2020 I think, because that was when I started ""investing"". 

That's also why I don't want to talk about the trading/financial aspects of this whole meme stock situation, but want to take a look at the general behavior and use of language the past two months.

After deeply following the discussions about the effects of fake news, filter bubbles, the radicalization of individuals through social media and the laws and regulations regarding these topics in the past years (including research on these topics for an essay I wrote as a law student, which I still am), there are certain key words or phrases that have been established in the discussions and DDs regarding GME etc. that either make me really angry, frustrated or irritated. In the past couple of weeks, I had these thoughts swirling around, and wanted to share them:

\- I know confirmation bias is strong in all of us, me included, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't allow and discredit different opinions. A civilized discussion, where every argument/fact backed standpoint is heared and respected, is what brings the best results and answers, regardless the topic. 

\- ""CNBC FAKE NEWS"", ""THE MEDIA IS BOUGHT BY HFs"" etc. I totally see where these claims are coming from (the strange amount of articles regarding SLV etc.), but endlessly repeating these phrases has not a single positive effect. In my opinion, these phrases aren't apolitical at all, and hence shouldn't even be allowed in this sub. I'll explain why: Not only in the US, but also in Germany, these phrases, portraying established media outlets as ""fake"", ""controlled by XY"", ""biased towards left/right"", are predominantly used by populist groups and people with tendencies towards the conspiracy scene. Based on this, I can't read these phrases in a non political way, especially with all the discussions of the past years in mind. That's why I find it irritating to read these phrases over and over again not only in the daily discussion and GME threads, but also in popular posts on the hot page of wsb. 

\- In addition to the previous point, I'd like to introduce you to the concept of ambiguity (in-)tolerance.  

""Intolerance of ambiguity may be defined as ‘the tendency to perceive (i.e. interpret) ambiguous situations as sources of threat’; tolerance of ambiguity as ‘the tendency to perceive ambiguous situations as desirable"" [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_tolerance–intolerance)

 A phenomenon of social media ""discussions"" nowadays is the find, that many people are lacking the ability to accept different opinions and to accept the fact, that an event or a fact, (e.g. GME stock price, short %) may have more than one possible reason or explanation, especially if you prefer on of the reasons over the others. 

Regarding our situation, this often leads to people down voting, hating on and even threatening users who try to show different possible perspectives on the events surrounding the GME craze instead of having an open discussion and being thankful for a broader look on the situation. 

\- ""short ladder attacks"" This term, which was used more and more often during the first weeks of February after GME hit its high, resurfaced in the past couple of days in many threads and posts, even though we had many very solid DDs on why this term and concept is wrong and shouldn't be used. I don't know why, but I can't read any post with that term in it without a strange feeling in my guts, regardless of the overall quality of the post. 

Some additional points:

\- Since GME settled at around 40$, we had a new trending post setting a fixed event or date as the ""MOON TIME"" almost every day. and correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I remember not a single one of these theories became true. Most of the time it even felt like it had the opposite effect of letting the stock price drop once reaching the predicted date. That's why I stopped trusting these kinds of posts and hyping myself up for then being let down once again. The next ""big date"" is the 19th of March, with many people hoping for that to be the rocket launch. And as much as I too wish for it to be true, I really don't think we should continue to name fixed dates for a liftoff. 

Regarding that you always have to remember, that everything written here can be and most probably is read by not only us little idiot sandwiches, but by every single HF social media guy, every journalist and every other person who feels the need to waste some time on here. 

My conclusion is, that every hype that arises, also attracts people who bet on the bursting of it.

\- That leads to another point I want to make: not every chart action that happens is an evil strategy of a Bond villain like HF Manager. As I understand, it is a long known and ""popular"" strategy to invert the trending stock actions (buys/sells) of WSB users for profit. So keep in mind that every post with for example a solid theory for the next liftoff of GME or a DD for a stock that reaches the hot page, attracts many users who try to bet against it, which is completely normal. After all we are a bunch of individuals. In the end of the day everyone has his own profit in mind, and not a collective greater good. And that's not a bad thing, but the inner core of this sub, which made it what it is today. 

So all in all, think about what you read, try to understand different perspectives, engage in meaningful discussions, ask questions, and don't spend too much time on here. The squezoozle happens when it does, or maybe it won't, who knows, let the time show it.

**Circle in blue:**    Looking at the MacD, one of the indicators I've been following    religiously through today and last week for those following my posts. I    like the indicator, helps give me an idea where momentum is headed,    particularly when the scale of the chart is larger. I still watch the    indicator when I'm tracking the stock with 1m candles, but its less    helpful and predictable. But when its in the 1d time scale it becomes    more reliable since its less reactive to small jumps. Anyways. We are    starting to see an uptick in the MacD where on the 25th of Feb we saw    the first crossover since the 4th of Jan, you know, right before things    went ballistic... I digress, that's not what this DD is meant to point    out, but its a fun observation. Even better, momentum is climbing    steadily even after a weaker performance Thurs/Fri. For those who aren't  as familiar with MacD  I encourage you to check out the investopedia on it, super helpful and  explains it better than I ever could.   We see the 12 period Avg not  only crossed over, but as of today is   firmly in the positive region,  meaning we are in a bullish period now.   This is only encouraging the  price to rise, although does not guarantee   it.  GME is moving into a  bullish region for the first time in over a   month which is really  going to help push things up.

**Arrows in Green:**    I now draw your attention to my awful green arrows, on the RSI    indicator. I include this because it backs up what is reflected in the    MacD indicator - that GME is slowly becoming more and more bullish. RSI   (I once again encourage reviewing investopedia for this, direct link    below) in essence reflects proportion of buyers against sellers within    an avg'd high/low band for the period. As that purple line creeps    upward, the % of traders buying over selling is increasing. If the    purple line breaks above the dotted line the stock is considered    overbought, but i reckon for GME  that wouldn't be an issue. In fact as    GME moves to being overbought, volatility will re-enter the stock as    fundamentalists get worried, so those of you who have been missing  that,   I have good news... Oh, and what happened the last time it went  into   the overbought region? Double check the chart for that one. Once  again,   not the entire point of the DD and I'm not claiming the squeeze  will   happen as soon as it crosses over, but certainly it pushes  things it an   optimistic direction...

MacD  and   RSI are not 100% correlated, although they do sometimes move  together,   using both indicators to strengthen the bull thesis is  compounding. GME   has entered the buyers market according to these  indicators... We  closed  today (2021-03-01) with RSI @ 57.86.. A really  nice number if  you ask  me.

There  also appears to  be a  slight cup and handle trend showing up now, I'm  not a huge fan of   predicting movements solely on these kinds of  trends, and I think its a   weak trend at that, but I know this will be  someones cup of tea. I'm  not  great at reading those visual trends.

**My Thoughts:**    I like $GME, memes aside, the fundamentals are there, I really like   the  Chewy potential DD and that has been what I tend to gravitate   towards  in my explanations of why a squeeze doesn't matter entirely.   What I mean  by that  is even after a squeeze, GameStop has a lot going   for it so  I'm not worried if I miss the peak. The TL;DR of that DD  is  if the market cap of GME hits Chewy, the  price could be at  $600 on  natural growth. The company has some great  value transitioning  to  online only. Already we are seeing graphics  cards sold, a new market   for GameStop, a big step towards the one stop  shop envisioned. Besides   that, gaming is one of the fastest growing  industries, I've seen DD  for  $CRSR explaining that industry growth will  be a great catalyst  moving  forward."

86,86,ROBLOX (RBLX) ENTERING NYSE MARCH 10TH,2021-03-02 04:53:46,"What is RBLX? 

Roblox is a free to play game that has been around since 2006 while the company started in 2004. It has 199 million monthly users, more than Minecraft.  https://backlinko.com/roblox-users#roblox-monthly-active-users 
https://www.businessofapps.com/data/roblox-statistics/ 

Games and worlds are created by Roblox developers, which can be anyone due to the fact developers are individuals and you get paid based on how much your game or world is played. Roblox has created a game developer community. We all know Roblox because we or a niece or nephew have played it. March 10th is the day Roblox will be out on the NYSE as the ticker RBLX. 

Why March 10th could be a big opening day

RBLX is supposed to open on the market at 
$41.52 per share. I believe the stock will go anywhere from $50-$80 in the day due to the fact that it is a) already known b) good fundamentals c) stocks for entering the NYSE tend to rocket (ex.MORF) d) it has more active users than any game e) meme stock. If we’ve learned anything in the past month it’s that meme stocks like GME, AMC, and NOK may be memes but they can make us money. I think of RBLX as a smaller meme stock. Although the CEO is big on long term, always speaking in 5,10,15 year increments, nobody invests into a kids mobile game long term. That’s why I think after the peak, people will take profit and leave. Don’t stay in too long. 

Why Roblox wasn’t enlisted in the NYSE earlier like planned 

They have in game currency which now can be a monthly subscription bringing in even more revenue. Roblox was initially suppose to enlist in the NYSE earlier but “because of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's scrutiny of how the video game platform recognizes revenue in its finances, according to a memo the company sent to employees on Thursday.” https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/01/29/sec-scrutiny-delays-roblox-stock-market-listing.html 
The reason for this delay was due to the immense increase in revenue from their monthly round subscription. What RBLX deemed as revenue and the SEC differed, halting them to redo their financials. 

Why RBLX is a good company 

Roblox Global Player Spending has almost doubled from 65.2M in January 2020 to 102.9M in May 2020. So imagine how much it has increased since then now in February 2021. 
Roblox Valuation has doubled from 2.5B in 2018 to 4B in 2020. In May 2020 Roblox was the 3rd highest grossing game in mobile games. They have 3 billion total engagement hours each month. Since 2017 annual revenue has gone from 45.7M to in 2019 435M.

Everyone's going through analysis paralysis. If you want to read my other post about 1, 2 and 3. Tldr below


No proof or DD just opinions. 

1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits. 

2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will. 

3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv. 

4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.

I bet you he's sitting there shaking his head at us dumb apes. He can't say anything or else it'd be market manipulation or whatever and this would all be over. Instead he supports us via his other ways. Stay strong. Why stop at Wendy's when we can make it to the moon?

TLDR: DFV is an intelligent person and able to do his own DD. Yea he has money and was in for deep value, but things change and people adapt, and my opinion is he won't sell low. Not because he has alot of money and can Yolo and not worry, but it's just a better move to sell high. Alot higher.... This is not financial advice. I hope everyone gets their tendies high or low, but for everyone's sake high, because each and everyone of us deserves it. 

Edit 1: I get it guys, DFV has banked already. But still begs the question, whether you bought in at 40 or 400 a share, or if you are a broke ass, have money, or have LOTS of money, why settle for less? Wouldn't DFV or yourself say that? Honest question. Not a financial advisor or psychologist. I want tendies and lots of it, do what it takes to make lots of it, that's all. (except stuff you shouldn't do, read#2)

Edit 2: Tldr, love everyones discussions and none of this math and shill stuff. Hurts apes brain."

93,93,My Bear Case for CCL (Carnival Cruise Lines),2021-03-02 07:45:19,"(Sorry this is long, I have TL;DR throughout and at the bottom)

To start off, I know what you’re thinking. “Cruises are totally a recovery stock, and CCL is trading at $26.35 a share, 45% lower than the January prior to COVID. With vaccine news this is a no-brain buy.” And while that’s the sentiment that has driven up price, it doesn’t account for a variety of factors. (Given, this is a fair bit speculative on what the CDC will announce, but we can make pretty safe bets).

**Share Dilution and Current Market Cap**

Since COVID forced a shutdown of the cruise industry CCL has taken on a boat-load of debt. After selling $1 Billion in shares last week they had secured $23.5 Billion in liquidity since COVID began, and their long-term debt raised from $9.7B to $25B. They diluted shares like crazy throughout the whole process. Even now if you look at the current market cap of CCL ($30.54B) it is only 16.26% lower than prior to COVID (36.47B). This amount of dilution and current market cap is kind of alarming to be honest.

They have pushed back the due dates of some contracts of new ships and a port, but they have sizeable financial obligations throughout the next several years. At $3B average net revenue prior to COVID, the interest and payments on the addition of possibly $20B in debt by the time they return to normal, as well as obligations, is going to screw net profits over.

*TL;DR*: Crazy dilution of shares means that current stock price is much closer to pre-covid levels than it appears, but with the addition of $15 Billion in debt added to the company so far, and an expensive next year ahead that I’ll touch on below.

**Ramp up Period**

With the CDC’s release of the “Framework for Conditional Sailing” late last year we saw a generalized process of how cruises will return back to normalcy. In summary cruise liners are still waiting for even more updated instructions from the CDC on how to specifically conduct these but each cruise will need to operate trial cruises, at normal staffing levels and expected capacity, to prove that implemented safety processes won’t result in new cases. After these trial cruises are conducted, they can apply for conditional permits no sooner than 30 days before the scheduled departure of the cruise.

This process is going to be incredibly expensive. Currently CCL is losing $3-5B a quarter maintaining and staffing the ships with skeleton cruises, and several are dry docked. In order to get passed off by the CDC they will incur additional maintenance expenses as well as the costs of running several complete cruises, filled to allowed capacity with non-paying test subjects, with $0 in revenue for doing so.

On top of this we can expect the CDC to mandate social distancing practices, even if cruise liners require passengers to receive vaccinations prior to booking. One of the only operating cruise liners right now is offering no-destination cruises in Singapore. They go out and back throughout three days, and capacity is limited to 50% of ship capacity. I would expect this 50% capacity to be mandated on all US originated cruises.

For cruises to be profitable they need to fill every single room on board. Ships normally operate at \~105% capacity, as a majority of expenses these companies incur are fixed expenses (fuel, operating expenses, insurance and some other onboard expenses, and to a degree payroll expenses and food for employees, as you do not have a proportionate crew size for a lower capacity cruise, a majority of positions are necessary for the customer experience).  While profit margins on booked cruises are high (17% for the industry) a 50% capacity limitation would destroy these margins and ensure that every single cruise operates at a loss for the duration of the restrictions.

On top of this, 25% of reservations that have been cancelled since January 2020 opted out of full refunds and received travel credits and onboard vouchers totaling 20% of ticket price. This is a MASSIVE amount of already recognized unearned revenue, and while it helped the company maintain liquidity it  will further reduce profits as cruise bookings pick up and a large number of people who opted into credit are the mega-cruise fans that will be booking as soon as allowed, and will use the 20% on-board voucher to cover a majority of onboard expenses that would provide additional revenue to Carnival. They will be 0 revenue- net loss customers, and consist of a huge amount of people.

*TL;DR:* We can expect even larger losses during the next quarter as CCL tries to get approval to cruise, and we can expect large losses on every cruise through the rest of 2021 unless the CDC deems there is no risk at 100% capacity.

**Cruise Destination Limitations Through 2021**

We can expect to see a limited number of destinations throughout 2021. Canada this week announced that it will not be permitting cruises originating from outside of Canada to dock at Canadian ports until February 2022. Several cruise lines have already cancelled Alaska and Canadian cruises until that date, and you can expect every other company in the industry to follow suit.

Additionally, I can all but guarantee that with their restrictions in place cruises will not be allowed to travel to Australia or New Zealand throughout the remainder of the year, and will see a limited number of European countries that allow them. The Cayman Islands has announced that by request of residents and business they will be largely reducing cruise calls indefinitely. So optimistically we see cruises domestically as well as to select destinations in the Bahamas, Central, and South America throughout the remainder of the year.

To further complicate this, the CDC still hasn’t announced what their guidelines on recreation cruise travel will be. I would not be surprised if destinations were limited to either: a) countries with below a certain level of infection, b) countries with above a certain level of vaccination, or c) countries without the presence of confirmed COVID-19 variants. The last thing they want is the spread of mutations that current vaccinations aren’t as effective against.

*TL;DR:* Optimistically we will be extremely limited in destinations throughout at least the remainder of 2021. Worst case the CDC will limit travel to select countries with low rates or only domestic/no destination cruises.

**Executive Sell-Offs**

In the last two months the CEO, CFO, and General Counsel members have sold off over $4.5 million in shares. Just as many insiders in the industry are selling off, they believe current prices are overvalued. Just sayin🤷‍♂️.

**Even more Hypotheticals**

*Bull case for CCL* would be the CDC allowing 100% capacity cruises ASAP, which would currently mean resuming in June of this year. Demand is definitely pent up and absent legal limitations cruise liners will see above average bookings for the foreseeable future. Best case scenario they’ll return to normal revenue, hell maybe even higher (prior to covid they would net $3B a year). This obviously doesn’t account for increased interest rates and payments through 2027 for the $20B they will have borrowed throughout the last year. Best case they will have recovered from COVID by 2024? Maybe? If they have great finances?

*Bear case for CCL* would be that the CDC enacts tighter restrictions. 50% capacity cruises, limitations to foreign ports and possibly only even domestic cruises. This would last at least throughout the remainder of the year, may become less stringent as time goes on and case numbers drop. Would see affects well into 2022. This would cause bleeding losses throughout the remainder of the year, and possibly needing to incur additional debt. If cruises have additional cases on board we may see mandated ship quarantine scenarios again which would damage PR even more and add expenses. We’d look at an 7-10 year recovery.

**TL;DR**: Long term CCL is absolutely screwed. While retail is currently hyped due to vaccine news, big money that have a hell of a lot more knowledge than I do, and company executives are dipping out. CCL has an incredibly long recovery ahead of it and I can expect stock price to bleed long term as dilution is factored in, even through short term volatility.

Clearly these target prices are aggressive, but my question is this... if so many people are convinced there is an impending squeeze, why wouldn’t they be buying calls (for example) for Jan 21, 2022 with a strike price of say, around $800?

While the premium is pretty hefty at the moment (b/w $22.40 and $31.05 per contract), the potential profit on this would be very significant if the stock price hit $400+ in the next few weeks or even months.

Since the expiration is so far out, they would theoretically have time to wait out the squeeze over the next few months, instead of risking the same calls expiring over the next few weeks and trying to time the squeeze. I understand the risk on this is high, but it seems like a reasonable bet if you are convinced the squeeze is impending and want to roll the dice.

Are the people who are convinced the stock will rise to $1,000 soon just not willing to dish out the premium? Or am I missing something in the “strategy” I laid out?

Genuinely curious here as I do think a squeeze could be triggered in a few weeks around earnings."

* Dividends are coming 3/9 of $1.1 per share.
* Massive green [earnings report](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-Experiences-Explosive-Growth-Revenue-Increases-144-year-over-year-to-4.7-Billion-in-Fourth-Quarter-Company-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-1.11-per-Class-A-Share-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx) released on 2/26  📈 📈
* Insiders own a huge proportion of the stock, greatly reducing the available float.
* A decently high short interest rate, along with 0 available shares for shorting.
* The   shorts are incentivized to close their positions before 3/9, so as to   avoid paying the dividend rate. At the current 43,090,000 short shares   outstanding that would mean 47,400,000$ in losses set in stone for  short  holders after 3/9.

I'm not saying this is a squeeze because that term is overused as fuck,  but  I am saying this could explode into the 30-35$ range for a few days   sometime between now and 3/9. Get it while its cheap!

135,135,Banana futures 🍌,2021-03-02 05:05:23,"As a long term investor, i like to stay ten steps ahead of trends. 

When my 4200.69 sell limit order for GME gets filled this week, this ape 🦍 will have plenty of tendies.  

What will I do with these tendies? Buy bananas, of course. 

I think I’m not the only one. There are millions of more 🦍 stronk together.

Therefore i think the GME mars mission will have massive implications for the banana markets. Demand for bananas could see a ten fold increase

You can lock in the price of bananas with futures contracts. If it’s USD vs bananas, go long on bananas. Price increases could be disastrous for us 🦍🦍🦍

EDIT:

Seeing a lot of negativity here....

I’ll have you know I was at the top of my special ed class in high school for one semester.

138,138,What if HF decide to help the gamma squeeze just to sell at some point and make ton of money to recover the loss they made until now?,2021-03-02 13:34:41,"So my authistic brain decided to think and I need someone who understands this better than me to give me and all of us here some better insights.
Scenario:
HF decide to help the gamma squeeze just to sell at some point and make ton of money to recover the loss they made until now. On the other hands, a lot of newly incoming apes would be hurt as they buy on bigger rates.

I would like some IQ300 ape brain to help me explain the possibilities in this scenario.
The question is:
-How much actual money HF lost until now because of the movement?
-How much the price needs to rise so they meet the point when they will recover all loses after selling?

Our strategy is simple! Buy and hodl! But I am sure that they have the advantage of machine learning, automatization and all technology high brain things that none of us apes would even understand. If the price comes to the point when they would recover, the computer would sell for themself. Heck, they are shorting the stock all the time with the use of machine learning and automatization.

We need to be smarter than that! We need to be prepared!

Now, my lulz solution is to actually SHORT THE HEDGE FUNDS! Destroy them with THEIR weapon!
Sell the stock right before they come to the point they would recover themself!
When the price would start falling down they would be so surprised that they would lose themself and shit their pants. They would try to get rid of stock and we would face the DISCOUNT of millennium! Then we would buy again and go to the actual alpha centauri.

I need some experienced ape to give his/her insight and opinion about this idea!

Edit: I just realized this is kinda too manipulative which could also be wrong from moral side. I just like the stock so keep holding!"

Each charging station (remember, public and in Europe) needs 15kg copper, meaning that in 9 years Europe will use 45.000 tones of copper.

The anual production of copper is 18.000 tones. The demand will grow, alone with the demand of the ev charging station (public and in Europe) 30% per year. 

Europe is one of the best continents for the EV thanks to it small dimension. Imagine the number we will see in Australia, Rusia, China, Canada or the USA... the demand of copper will go up over 50%-60% from the actual production each year...

""Our Company's Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $1.11 per share payable on March 23, 2021 to holders of our Class A common stock of record at the close of business on March 9, 2021.""

What this means is that 3/9 is the record date and 3/8 is the ex-dividend date, hence you will need to own RKT stock by the close on 3/5

**""Once the company sets the record date, the ex-dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules. The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend. ""**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zwljw4q5nmk61.jpg?width=838&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67c3374c918471d55a5e40f2716e65fa5dbf4c1c

As you may be aware, every institution is telling you NIO has failed expectations. That NIO is a not what you though it was and is on Rocky ground. When the truth is they are manipulating the facts like Bobby Axelrod and trying to make money off this stock both ways. 

I'm here to tell you, that you a being manipulated into believing this company is failing so they can short your money and turn around and buy your shares for cheap. 

February is always a slow month in China. What is important to note is that February sales have increased 689% over last years sales. 

Profit for NIO is not great but you have to remember that this company is not very old. Getting this company into Europe 2nd quarter this year is going to take some debt and bold moves. NIO is looking at the bigger picture and building a rock solid foundation on which to grow. The days of overnight riches may be gone on this stock, but that doesn't mean this stock won't make you rich. Just wait till numbers come out later this year with Europe sales included. NIO will sell over 150k cars this year and that will just be the beginning. 

Don't let institutions get used to beating you out of every hard earned dollar you thought you invested wisely. You have and NIO is still a must have stock in your portfolio. 

Again, I'm just a retard and don't know how to write up DD but do what you will with this information, I'm not responsibly for your stupidity."

This one is going to be *very* interesting to watch. On the one hand, everyone on WSB has been talking about shorting the shit out of their IPO. On the other, if they're beholden to their investors like Citadel then I wouldn't be surprised to see it do well because of their massive backing, especially since there's still a ton of users that either are too lazy to switch to another broker, or just don't care enough to bother.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so this might take a bit.

February 25 at 942 am after a night of GME rocketing its way back into the limelight one of the most peculiar things I have ever seen in my days of watching charts happened. 

For several minutes the Bid/Ask spread for GME was 50 points. In the picture you can clearly see a bid of 125 and an ask of 174. It was there..... I stared at it for some time that morning in disbelief. 

Before you ask, no that wasn't when the trading was halted. And you may ask what shares traded at.... they seemed to all trade at a price of either 124.04 or 124.05.

What is even funnier is that if you go back to the te and trade there were 10s of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of shares that traded there.

If you look at the Bid/Ask price on the books it is.....
You guessed it. B124.04 A124.05

Now I am just a fucking retard, but even I can see that some record has been changed here. 

You can literally scroll for 10 minutes as fast as you can scroll through time and trade and you will see the same prices. 

I think it is worth some attention.

Now I admit, I only like losing money *some of the time*, so that doesn't mean I'm stuck in boomer T-bills, wondering how I can clamor for yield. Here's a low risk, high growth play that attractively suits any risk profile. 

FSR recently climbed into the mid-high 20s range, as a result of several positive catalysts that emerged. For starters, FSR announced a partnership with Foxconn, which I think we all know is the gold standard for high-quality technology-hardware manufacturing (see Apple). Foxconn has deep supply chains/international clients that are invaluable to an emerging player like Fisker, which bodes well as the partnership looks to target markets spanning the Americas, Europe, China, and India.

Now unlike many EV wannabes clamoring for a share of this lucrative market, Fisker is one of the few that has been at the rodeo before. Unlike boomer bureaucracies (GM/Ford) or wannabe startups (XL/WKHS), FSR is Henrik Fisker's brainchild, and boy is he a notable automotive designer! From the BMW Z8 to 007's DB9, this is a guy who knows how to design a car that *you want* *to drive*, enough said.

Furthermore, this is Fisker's second at-bat as a commercial play. Fisker launched Fisker Automotive in 2007, but even Gods cannot control macro forces (a combination of the financial crisis and its battery supplier going bankrupt forced the firm into a sale). Having launched FSR in 2016 (2020 SPAC) the company has had time to learn from its previous mistakes, which are often glossed over when considering the skillsets necessary for an EV player to rise to stardom (TSLA comes to mind).

But why is FSR not your ordinary SPAC, jack, and run? ***FSR is*** ***so undervalued and has so much room to run.*** Let's consider valuations really quickly (yes, I know WSB hates this, but earnings just came out and they rocked)- TSLA currently trades at 6.5X 2025 revenues, NIO at 3.8X, 2025 revenues,, and XPENG at 2.6x. For comparison, assuming FSR reaches its target of 200,000 units sold in 2025, Fisker is trading at roughly 1.0X 2025 revenues, assuming a $30 share price and $9.5 market cap- *this is crazy b/c FSR is trading at roughly $27 as of today, even on the back of good news*. 

Yes, you read that right. At TSLA's multiple, FSR is a $200 stock.

Now, *I'm not just buying/talking up FSR because it's cheap* *or to daydream while I rip fat chops-* I really like FSR's long term strategy with respect to production/manufacturing. Unlike TSLA, GM, Volkswagen, or pretty much any company aspiring to compete in the EV space, FSR outsources manufacturing to established names like Foxconn, whilst working on UI, design, and software at home. *I think this is genius*.

Unlike any the well-known EV names, which have to worry about how arbitrary fears like rising rates or engulfed trade relations affect their earnings, FSR makes it someone else's problem by giving it to the smartest/skilled manufacturer in the room. Not only does this save on hefty capital expenditures/liabilities, but allows FSR to focus on the software aspect that differentiates EVs from yo momma's car and justifies their insane valuations. And to their credit, Fisker estimates this outsourcing approach will expedite their launch time to 29 months from 60 months traditionally.

From what FSR has said so far, it seems like the Foxconn play appears to be an attempt for the company to play in Asia, and perhaps the U.S. Already, FSR has a partnership with Magna (MGA) in Europe- another high quality manufacturer that mirrors some of Foxconn's strengths, but only in Europe. With these two heavyweights under their belt, all FSR will have to do is execute on the software side, which is never an easy proposition, but looks optimistic given the company's track record.

But Fisker also projects to deliver 200,000 units by 2025, across their 5 different expected models by that point. Again, assuming a conservative average sale price of $55,000 (FSR internal estimates are in the $60,000) range, this thing is a Puritan-conservative's value play worth $11B. When you factor in a partnership with AAPL's lover, a beautiful EV that *actually looks cool*, considerable undervaluation, and a decent cash position (about roughly $1B- way more than so many other EV firms), FSR is a great flier, and likely going into orbit.

So tldr, I am extremely bullish on Fisker. Henrik Fisker said himself the partnership with Foxconn would produce some new car that would be ""futuristic,"" ""something completely different,"" ""affordable,"" ""and will introduce things that probably will almost feel a little scary to some people.""  


FSR to the moon! 💎🙌💪🏽🦍🚀

\-Option chain: NOK mostly treading water for quite some time. Calls have been free money at the 5-7 level. Breaching this call wall would likely cause additional share purchasing leading to positive growth cycle.

\-Assessment: As in all stocks, a risk, but a pivot into 5G puts NOK as a good competitor to deliver capability with Ericsson to the US and Europe. Huawei is assessed to be a risk to European and US interests due to capability to backdoor infrastructure for data theft and risk to infrastructure supply chains. Nokia is assessed to capture a large portion of the 5G market leading to increased growth.

Hedge funds and other market makers may try to manipulate the market to force the share price down so they can cover the calls and potentially shorts saving millions on their end. They may be playing the waiting game and wait for paper hands and others to sell Becuz the gamma squeeze didn’t happen immediately. An example of this is last week when the share price shot up to 11$ on Wednesday after hours due to calls being covered from the previous week.  Wednesday makes sense Becuz that’s 3 days after the markets opened (Monday) so we can expect the “gamma squeeze” at the latest on Wednesday after markets close. Might happen earlier. Either way it’s a good thing for us in the long term making the short squeeze happen if we hold Becuz the cycle repeats. Price goes higher more calls in the money = more gamma squeezes. Eventually we’ll get to triple digits and potentially 1000$ a share. For this to happen people must be prepared to hold for a little over a month in a best scenario situation. Please don’t be misled by “double ur money tomorrow” or anyone that gives you a specific date. Although they are partially right be prepared to wait it out and don’t get disappointed when it takes longer than what you were led to believe. Friday almost everyone was saying Monday is the squeeze but did not mention the 3 day rule so a lot of ppl were disappointed today. We need ppl to hold in order for everyone to win and setting these expectations will not help us in the long run. Hopefully answered some of your questions and cleared some of your doubts.

oh yea THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE THIS IS PURELY EDUCATIONAL GAMBLE RESPONSIBLY

>Forgive me retards. This is a long read. In order to transmit what I now understand to you I need to use this medium of ‘text’ which can be difficult, because it requires us to read. Not one of our strenghts.

Now this strategy has worked for me for a while, but I have been burnt badly in the process. I willy-nilly copied Michael Burry investing in Tailored Brands, which went bankrupt. I fortunately saved my investment before it went bust while I was travelling abroad. I got stuck in a overseas country due to Covid…before the whole market crash. I sold all of my stocks before the crash because I thought, after seeing what happened in Italy, America would soon realise the extent of the problem and the market would appreciate the consequences.

This lead me to my current strategy. Copy, but first understand. Even geniuses make mistakes. And hey, maybe my smooth brain will wrinkle a bit in the process! The process to understand utilizes intense DD, intense research, all in the efforts to increase the probability of success.

I am not nearly as smart as them, but if we can stand on the shoulders of giants then maybe one day we can see further than even they saw. (we love you B-man)

**The case for Uniti:**

Daddy Burry showed on his 13-F that he’s invested in a number of different stocks. Most of them in inlation-hedged industries. Uniti is a Telecommunications REIT (no REIT is not short for RETARD). Uniti is a one of a kind. There is no other public business that does exactly what it does. The closest competitor is Zayo. Similar but not the same are Crown Castle internation corp, but they are extremely overvalued and their name is gay. (I have nothing against gays please don’t cancel me LGBT community).

What does Uniti do? It’s pretty weird- they Buy the ‘property’ of Fiber and copper lines that transmit data across the U.S. FROM telecommunication companys. Then they rent it back to them. It helps the other telecoms up free capital and has tax advantages.

Long-story short, they rent Fiber to telecommunications companies and also have their own Fiber segment. Once the intial “anchor” network has been made Renting FIBER becomes incrementally profitable. Super HIGH margin and super duper easy. It also creates very predictable cash flows because these dudes sign super long IRU leases (leases you cannot void).

**1) Why did the stock get so reckt, but Uniti doesn’t even make profit, OMG Uniti debt is huge.**

1. Uniti was orginally spun-off from Windstream. Imagine like a big beyblade and then you spin it and a smaller bleyblade comes out of the big beyblade. Uniti became its own company and inherited all its assets from Daddy Windstream.  
After the Spin-off Uniti took most of ALL the fiber and copper in the ground and rented it BACK to Windstream. Daddy Windstream became Uniti’s biggest and ONLY customer- diversification is for Pusaaysss. So then Daddy Windstream accumulated too much debt and headed for bankruptcy. Imagine your biggest and only client going bust. Obviously this is like super bad and so Uniti’s share price gets smashed.  
Then Windstream files for Bankruptcy AND Windstreams Creditors are NOT happy becuause of the spin-off ect.  
So *yes* the company’s future was not certain at all and the stock price reflected that.  
**Then Uniti had a settlement with Windstream and the settlement was sooo good.**  
In the settlment Uniti got exclusive rights to 18.1 MILLION of Windstreams fiber and got some Windstream assets. Uniti’s side of the deal required them to issue shares to Windstream (to compensate windstreams creditors) and also to pay windstream money (24Million every quarter until 490M is paid off). + Windstream can make them repair and extend the lines that Windstream rents from Uniti.  
This settlement is great news for Uniti and happened last year. The share price basically doubled on the news- but I believe it’s still *moderately* undervalued (super undervalued compared to Tech and other bubbles). To be honest, I kinda missed the boat. This company was a GREAT buy at EBITDA/EV of like 5 back when share-price was 6$- (now at $12 \*sulk\*).
2. 2 and 3 will both go here. Unti makes huges margins but doesn’t make a profit because their debt costs are so high. This isn’t going to be a problem into 2021 and 2022 because FITCH upgraded their credit rating. They have already refinanced 1.1Billion of their debt- go look at sec.gov 8Ks. It’s recent. With this news I think in 2021 and 2022 Uniti can SIGNIFICANTLY reduce their interest cost, and expand their magins bigly so as to start printing tendies for their shareholders. **The worst is over. The worst was the settlement, which turned out super good.**  
Their Revenue is like \~260Million per quarter and their interest expense was like 100 MIllion, like WTFFF. When I saw this I got worried, but upon further research I realised it’s actually fine. With the recent re-financing they will reduce their interest expense almost by \~16M. Still not enough I think…then if you start reading through the earnings transcripts you see that the CEO and the CFO aren’t even remotely worried about their debt- why is this?  
Uniti’s revenues are extremely stable, they are IRU leases which cannot be voided until the contract ends. They can also do these cool things called Opco-Propco transactions (which they recently did) which brings a bunch of cash upfront that they can use to pay down debt (If they need to). The CEO and the CFO aren’t worried about the debt now because they can refinance it at lower rates later AND they are more excited about all the opportunities in their market. They have (57-18)= 39M of sales in the pipeline most of which are ***“lease-up”*** sales which means they just add onto their existing network which means SUPER HIGH MARGINS because the network is already there, they don’t need to invest much more capex into it to realise these revenues.  


[Money making spider web](https://preview.redd.it/os2yk9qy6jk61.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf3122cc923fa7225d9eb3abf3d85a723ea85855)

&#x200B;

So Mr CFO and CEO are going to grow their EBITDA this year. This increase will better their credit rating. Big players in the industry have a debt cost of around 1.5-3%. Uniti's was like 7% average until recently. Imagine they more than half this cost in the coming 2 years? That’s like +50\~M more cash to shareholders.

**As of right now we have a company “Uniti” that’s problems are pretty much behind it. A management team that is looking very forward to the future. Trading at an EBITDA/EV value of around 9 (based on latest latest earnings).**

An EBITDA/EV of 9 is not super low. But it is still low when you look at competitors and this industry. This industry is based on super stable income from all their IRU leases (Leases that cannot be voided)- windstream even had to continue to pay THROUGH bankruptcy, so that’s how NOT-voided these contracts are lol.

I wrote half of this report yesterday, and then the earnings came out….so heres another half based on what I see…

Huge up-tick in revenue and EBITDA from leasing up their Leasing business. Way better than what I expected- *I guess the management wasn’t fibbing about the opportunities in the market*. They have also managed to bring their leverage ratio (debt/capital) down to 5.71. HUGE improvement. They were running at 6+ in 2020. They now have a leverage ratio that can compare nicely to peers AND give them a better arguement when trying to re-finance their debt at even lower rates.

I’m taking a smallllly position in them because with their growth outlook, and undervaluedness compared to peers.

In September or so one of their biggest shareholders, who came out owning shares due to the settlement might dump their shares. I bloody hope they do because I will scoop this thing up anywhere below $8 per share.

Oh and hey….

Inflation is on its way boys and traps

Manfacturing prices which then leads to increases in CPI

225,225,More Ways to Fuck Bears,2021-03-01 21:25:26,"Alright, degenerates. Hope you’re all feeling good, it was a bullish as hell day for the entire market, and to my fucking relief it wasn’t ridiculously volatile. I can’t handle that volatility, my little heart is beating hard enough trying to get my fat ass out of my parent’s basement at least once a day so I can get some fucking food.

So, I wanna say, I’m long on GameStop and AMC- in fact, my net worth is almost entirely from those two stocks. I started with $3k in December and am now sitting on a cool $130k, and I’m feeling fucking good about it. However, I want to take a moment to do a little bit of teaching.

You know how when you’re YOLOing your entire net worth on GME and AMC calls expiring this week, you have to put money down, and it’s a fucking shit ton of money if you were to buy a call outside of this week? Who does that money go to? That’s right, 🌈 🐻. Now, what if I were to tell you that you could be just as bullish, set up the ability to AUTOMATICALLY AVERAGE DOWN if the stock crashes, and get paid for the right to do it?

It exists, and it’s fucking simple: The cash-covered put. Now, you’re already bullish on AMC, right? Okay. You have your 1000 shares, you’re feeling good, but you still have 10k sitting outside of the market. You don’t care about any other stocks, what, you are supposed to look at more numbers next to more than two sets of three letters? Fuck off.

Here’s how this would work. Look at AMC right now. It’s above $9 per share, and it’s not going to fucking go back down. That would be stupid. Stocks. Only. Go. Up.

Here’s what you can do: Tomorrow morning around 9:30AM EST, you look at the fucking stock and you open up the option chain and you pick the $9 Strike Put Expiring this Friday and you hit the sell button and you sell ten puts expiring this Friday, that’s 1000 shares worth. And what happens, do you ask?

Well, you get paid a premium of $1000 to sell that put. That’s right, the bears are paying you now for the right to lose money by being bearish on fucking AMC. You put $8000 on the line, and you can’t touch that until you either buy to close the put you sold or it expires OTM.

But, Ragnaroktagon, what is my risk? What happens if it goes down? That’s the beauty of it: If the stock closes below $9 on Friday, then you get the stock. 1000 more shares. And because of the premium you were paid by those idiot bears, you are in the green on that stock so long as the stock stays above $7.97.

And if it stays above $9 per share on Friday? You get your initial investment back plus a clean $1000. You can’t fucking lose. Either you get more of the stock, or free money. And, since you already own those 2k shares, you benefit from the stock going up with those as well, and on Monday morning you have liquidity again with the ability to either do it again or buy some more fucking calls, you filthy animals.

227,227,PLTR: Info for you tards,2021-03-01 21:50:29,"**TLDR: Long term hold, just now branching out into the private sector.**

Sup degenerates. Scrolling through the Daily Discussion for the past few days I've seen a lot of misery surrounding PLTR because it's dropped freakin 10$ a share in the past week or so. I'm struggling with you, but there is literally no downside to the stock. The price has gone down because of some negative media attention, trying to drive the price down in combination with lockup expiry that happened yesterday. TGIF and we're seeing some premarket action in a positive direction today.

But what does Palantir actually do? That's the question everyone wants answered. It's tough for people who aren't involved in the type of stuff the company does to understand, but there was a decent explanation done on Quora a few years ago that is still VERY relevant to the company, even as they branch out into the private sector. Yes, they are still heavily involved in government contracts for the good ol' US of A and her allies, but now that it has a solid foothold and has developed its software to be crucial in development of foundational intelligence in a variety of government sectors, they are moving into spaces which are going to be more profitable for shareholders.

So here comes the Quora response. It's from 6 years ago and comes from a blog that has since been upgraded to a full up website and this post has gone away from it, but it's still very relevant to the here and now even with the fast pace of technology today. **Seriously, if you are in Palantir or are thinking about getting into it, read it. It's a short read, and a good beginning for someone trying to figure out just what the fuck this company does.**

*By Kevin Simler*

I often ask candidates if they’re familiar with what we do at Palantir. Most people think they are. “Oh, you’re that data viz. company,” or, worse, “You guys do data mining, right?” At least they’ve heard of us and at least they’re on the right track, but I cringe anyway. We aren’t just a “data visualization” company and we don’t do “data mining.” It’s almost impossible to convey the scope and complexity of what we do in a few short minutes—or to do so without taking the conversation to an eye-glazing level of abstraction.

The following is my attempt at describing what we do at a high level without oversimplifying. I hope that after reading this a candidate will ‘get’ what we’re about, or at least understand enough not to apply tiny labels to our expansive vision.The problem: implementing analysisAt Palantir we specialize in **analysis**.Yes, that’s painfully abstract, and I’ll get to it in a second.In real-world terms, we are building a **software platform** that enables people to take whatever data is relevant to them and understand it more easily and thoroughly than ever before, using concepts that they already understand. And we are applying this vision, at first, to solving problems in the finance sector and the government intelligence community.The first important thing to note is that we don’t actually do the analysis ourselves. We don’t devise winning trading strategies and we don’t catch terrorists. We write software that enables other people to pull off these feats. These people, experts in their respective fields, are called \*analysts.\*So what exactly do analysts do? What is analysis?

>Analysis is everything necessary to extract **insight** from **information**.

Let’s break that down a bit.Information is easy: It’s data. It lives in a relational database or as files indexed on a hard drive, and you can easily run queries against it. It comes in two forms, structured and unstructured. And there is *a lot* of it in the modern world – too much, actually, for current tools to make sense of.Insight is trickier. Insight is something only a person can generate, and understanding this is critical for any organization that wants to do analysis right. Thus the challenge of data analysis is how to bring vast amounts of information into productive contact with human intelligence. In other words, the challenge is how to *enable the analyst*.From the analyst’s perspective there are five essential features of an analysis platform:

1. First, and most important, ***the analyst should be in control***. In other words, the primary way of interacting with an analysis tool should be *human-driven queries*. While automated approaches can complement a human-driven approach, there simply is no substitute for human intelligence. Unless you put a person behind the wheel, the system can never be flexible or creative enough to uncover truly original insight. Artificial Intelligence just isn’t there yet.
2. Ability to ***summarize large data sets***. Some of this is what has traditionally been called data mining: the largely automated approach—using machine learning or other statistical techniques—of processing lots of data at once and extracting nuggets that capture something interesting about the data. Unlike Palantir, traditional approaches have focused almost exclusively on this aspect of analysis.
3. Ability to ***visualize large data sets***. Here the analyst wants interesting and informative ways of viewing data graphically, to make it easier for him to digest. The analyst wants more than just a summary of the data; he wants a nuanced view of what’s going on*inside* these data sets: What’s the overall shape of the distribution? What are the outliers? What are important structures within the data?
4. Ability to ***iterate rapidly***. This means enabling the analyst to ask a question, get the answer, and then quickly ask either a variant on the initial question or a follow-up question that depends on the answer to the initial question. This rapid, iterative process allows the analyst to quickly test out hypotheses and develop theories about what’s going on in the data, and by extension to discover what’s going on in the world.
5. Ability to ***collaborate with other analysts***. Getting a handle on a terabyte of data, especially when it comprises multiple data types, is definitely more than a one-person job. Any organization that’s serious about understanding the world needs a team of analysts that can work together as more than the sum of its parts. This requires the ability for one analyst to effortlessly share the results of his analysis with his colleagues.

The Palantir approachThat’s what analysis looks like to the analyst, or rather what it should look like in an ideal world. (Current tools fall far short of this vision.) So what do *we* do at Palantir in order to make analysis this smooth and easy?You could say that we help summarize large data sets, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a rich library of techniques and algorithms. You could also say that we do visualization, in the sense that we have to provide the analyst with a set of interesting and informative ways of visualizing their data. We do both of these things, and we have to be creative and solve hard problems in order to add value in these areas. But we do a lot more than that.Probably the most central hard problem that we address in trying to enable the analyst is **data modeling**, the process of figuring out what data types are relevant to a domain, defining what they represent in the world, and deciding how to represent them in the system. At Palantir we make sure our data model (ontology) is both flexible and dynamic, and that it mirrors the concepts people naturally use when reasoning about the domain. This is no small challenge, but we’re already making it a reality. In finance our basic data types include financial instruments, dates, portfolios, indices, and strategies—the same things that financial researchers think about, talk about, and reason with. In the intelligence product our basic data types include people, places, and events (all with associated properties), which is exactly the way we all represent the world in our minds.Data modeling, data summarization, and data visualization are the core disciplines for approaching large data sets. Human-driven queries, rapid iteration, and collaboration are multipliers, taking the power unlocked by the core disciplines to the next level. When these pieces are brought together in a coherent system, the result is in an analysis platform both very generic and very powerful.This is what we mean when we say that we’re changing the way people approach data. Welcome to the future of analysis."

this is a technique that i have been trying to introduce to the greater community. options are funny instruments im that, a persons perception of them and how they should be used, can severely limit how we use them. and we could miss opportunities because of this. initially people looked at this photo and said, WTF is that. below i have included my analysis from what i saw when i chose these 3 legs for tomorrow. 

——
buy the $55 call, sell the $55 put

your mid on that is $6.45

share price is 48.70

lets assume at some point in the future you will pay $55 per share. either you exercise your call or the put you sold gets exercised. but you are collecting a premium for that commitment of $6.45.

okay so, lets now say that you are actually paying $48.55 per share... 

strike at $55 less prems of $6.45 = $48.55

now add a leg and you sell a call with a strike at $50 to collect a premium of $2.15 because what did you pay for your shares? yessir, $48.55

also, for those that put emphasis on remaining delta neutral, you can opt to sell 2x of the $50 calls. i think it came out to be -0.067 or something close to that figure, if two calls are sold. and you’d have to double check that and you may beed to sell short or buy 50-80 shares depending on what ypur delta stacks up to be"

Consider the strategy here. 

RKT has a blowout earnings.

Rocket has 1.11 special dividend announced for March 8th close paid on March 23rd. 

Anyone holding short will and must pay 1.11 dividend.  

It would be in RKT's best interest to buyback shares before March 9th.  This means they pay less of the special dividend while Short interest is nailed.  

Anyone holding In the money calls can exorcise options to then hold stock and receive the $1.11 special dividend.

There is a lot of quality looking DD recently and if you are like me, completely new to investing in 2021 then you are very naive and inexperienced. Some of the stuff i have seen has been eye opening into how much I didn’t know could happen in investing and wallstreet.


This goes from the psychological warfare, manipulation of reporting and broker activity behind the scenes but also just general information around how the investment sphere works. 


There is so much content here, also in daily discussions about different stocks, gme, amc, bb, pltr, nok, silver, and even other stuff like bots and shills and the whole moderator drama.


Fuck me so much shit has happened. Even that 99% retard where there is now a conspiracy around their dd and a conspiracy about the critique of their dd. 


There is so many opinions and quality looking DD of DD that if you are like me it is completely overwhelming, but i trust the reason why i made my investment and I understand the maths behind it.
I understand the best way to get a return on my investment is to buy the stock i want to and just hold until i see a number I’m happy to sell for without over leveraging myself.


If you are like me and you started this wild ride of investing for the first time and like me you were retarded enough to go balls deep in gme 2021, just relax. Pick a number you want to sell for and wait for it, its that simple.


If you believe in the reason you invested, nothing you read should change that. 
Forget about missing the squeeze, forget about short interest and ladder attacks and all these other complications.


Focus on remembering why you believe in your investment and hold until you are happy to sell. 
You don’t need to make perfect profit to change your life.

241,241,The case for GME through analysis of... Pokémon.,2021-03-01 14:05:33,"This DD was requested as a standalone post by u/summersittingshotgun.

I did some fundamental analysis by watching the series Pokémon. It seems like the stars have aligned, because I found out there's a Team ROCKET that's leaping for the STARS. Also, they have a talking cat and that corresponds with THE roaring kitty, who can also talk. Furthermore, I can conclude the protagonist Ash Ketchum has a Pokémon called PRIMEAPE, which matches the description of us. Said protagonist also happens to own a Pokémon which is his MAIN POSITION called Pikachu. Said Pikachu refuses to evolve to a different evolution, which means said Pikachu is HOLDING his current position.

u/firebird22x mentioned the company that sells the Pokémon games.... GMEfreak.

Protagonist Ash Ketchum has a friends group of two people at the same time: either Misty, Brock, or some other characteristic beings. Both friends have two hands each, meaning they can hold things together even firmer, like Ash's firm, hard, and long position in GME.

Now, here comes the juiciest detail I found. What do you get when you rearrange the letters P O K E M O N?

PKE MOON

PKE is an abbreviation of POTENTIAL KINETIC ENERGY, which means whenever something is in motion, it has kinetic energy. Whereas energy stored in an object because of the position it is in is potential energy.

Basically: energy moving GME to the MOON.

Mind. Blown.

This complete and thorough analysis has led to me confirming my bias. I knew I was onto something when I heard the theme song and the quote ""I want to be the very best, like no one ever was"", obviously referring to the squeezerino.

Thought it might be of interest.",2021-03-02 01:31:52,"This isn’t financial advice, I’ve just seen a lot of discussion about a couple of stocks that people are interested in and thought this might be a nice bit of light reading while the market is closed.

Upon going on a popular search engine and typing in “as for me I like the stock” it came up with this result on the first page.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/theres-a-meme-taking-over-the-internet-and-it-actually-applies-to-investing-2018-04-05

Feel free to take a look at that.

The meme it refers to is “if you don’t love me at my... then you don’t deserve me at my...“ with two separate images shown. Memetastic. I’m sure you remember it. In the case of investing, it would be “if you don’t love me at my dip then you don’t deserve me at my moon”. That kind of thing.

Maybe this has already been shared a thousand times, I just haven’t seen it myself in the short time that I’ve been a member of this sub. But I think it is a noteworthy thing to keep in mind whatever you are investing in.

Give the whole article a read if you like, but pay particular attention to these nuggets - they can be applied to all walks of life, especially investing:



“Even in the biggest of dips, famous investors like Warren Buffett encourage a simple, long-term strategy of buy and hold, keep calm and invest on.
“Our favorite holding period is forever,” Buffett wrote in a Chairman’s Letter in 1988—the point being that your investing strategy, and everything in your portfolio, should be solid enough to endure the market’s natural fluctuations -- the market at its best, and the market at its worst. That way, you’ll only feel compelled to sell when the time is right for you.

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics, also recommends ignoring daily movement in one’s portfolio, and getting away from obsessively checking one's investments.

“Closely following daily [stock market] fluctuations is a losing proposition, because the pain of the frequent small losses exceeds the pleasure of the equally frequent small gains,” he wrote in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow.”

Need more proof that there’s no benefit from trying to time the market during periods of market volatility? Data have repeatedly shown that those who trade excessively tend to show much worse performance than the buy-and-hold investors who sit tight.
“Never make important decisions based on emotions,” says financial adviser Anthony Isola. “Turn off the T.V. and don’t check your account.”

TL;DR article from 2018 about buying and holding with quotes from Warren Buffet et al. Make your own minds up, it’s none of my business, but consider every option including buying and holding. Memes and stocks go hand in hand, dating back to at least April 2018."

Are the HFs syphoning every single share they can borrow to maintain the price at the current state ? Does it mean, the price will soon increase (when the amount of available shares will be 0) ?

It might sound very easy to understand for the majority of you but still, I'm retarded among the retards.

They thought he was dead, and after securing the area realized he was alive. They flew him to Germany, then to Walter Reed, where he eventually wore up and was told he'd never walk, and that they had resected some of his lover and intestines.

After a year in a wheel chair, and working hard every day, he was able to walk again, then run. I remember him telling me he couldn't wait to get back to his unit. The Army medically retired him though, and he went into a deep depression, with which he struggled for a number of years. He eventually graduated from college with an engineering degree, but his accomplishments were overshadowed by his PTSD.

278,278,What's Going on With Utilities? AEP? SO? I'm seeing it poised for 10-20% returns this year,2021-03-02 00:48:38,"Edit: I’m an engineer, so I’m disappointed in myself...  It isn’t a 20% potential upswing, it’s 30%.

I work in an electric Utility company, and I was following a Utility (American Electric Power, AEP) which I expected to have a good earnings call on 2021-02-25.  The earnings were great, beating estimates by 10.12%, revenues were flat from Q4 2019, which I took as sufficient, but Utilities took a beating along with everything else on the 25th.  Well, now the major indices are moving back up, but Utilities are still at least 10% depressed and not just from recent prices, but from 2019 prices.  Utilities usually compete with high return bonds, but bond rates are nowhere near the dividends Utilities are offering (>4%), and with the new administration pushing for electrification policies and keeping market interest rates low, regulated electric Utilities should be getting a big swell.

I think some people are concerned about Utilities that are holders of fossil Generation, but I'd argue they're looking at it all wrong.  Utilities are broken into three sections:  Transmission (T), Distribution (D), and Generation (G).  T & D are always regulated, but in recent years states have tried to lower prices by de-regulating the Generation side of electric Utilities.  This did lower prices, but it opens up the door to issues like what happened in ERCOT with the freezing temperatures, where highly competitive Generation Owners are trying to find any way they can to cut costs so they can compete with renewables.  Renewables actually can sell power at NEGATIVE prices, since they have the hefty renewable energy tax credit.  I'm very familiar with all of this on the technical side.

(BTW, you can expect what happened in ERCOT to happen in other regions, also)

Say a US administration's EPA starts making life difficult for fossil generation... well, the fact is that this is **only** an issue for Utilities that have fossil Generation in a state with a de-regulated Generation market.  Utilities like AEP have kept the company positioned with T & D across the country, and have been scooping up renewables nationwide.  They also only have fossil Generation in states with a regulated Generation market, which means they get a guaranteed return on sales that keeps ROE at about 10%.

If the EPA adds costs on **regulated** fossil Generation, the Utility just turns around to the public utility commission (PUC) and tells them they have new costs to add to the bills they send out to their millions of customers.  Customers who don't have a choice but to pay the costs which the EPA levied on the Utility.  Also, say a new Congress increases the business income tax.  Again, the Utility just turns to the PUC, points out the higher cost, and gets it spread across many millions of monthly electric bills.

People keep talking about what COVID recovery plays are still out there, and Boeing along with the airlines are usually at the top of the list.  Those are risky, and Utilities aren't.  They aren't sexy, and that's the only reason I can think of, for why people aren't moving money into the sector.  I'd appreciate any comments and feedback.  This is my first post in the community, I'll try to develop this into some better DD later.

286,286,DD on WW ($WW)... why its not a BOOMER STOCK .. hear me out 👉,2021-03-02 03:37:33,"
TLDR: The stock is undervalued. WW has a formula for success and new streams of revenue. P\E below average compared to sector. Conservative earning call and positive reaction. 🚀 fueling... giiiiddy up ☝

FUNdamentals: 
2020 versus 2019
Revenue down 2.8%
Gross Profit down 1.2%
Operating income down 24% 
EPS $1.07 versus $1.72

None of this looks very good. BUT, the market doesn't care about 2020 it cares about 2021 and beyond. 2020 was riddled with complex issues, restructuring, and a rushed business model change. 

The move to e-commerce and a fully digital environment for WW has major upside. WW has reported a slower growth rate compared to competitors in the digital arena, however they are likely far more profitable and have more to offer from their decades of experience in the industry. Despite all the bad metrics Gross Margin was up yoy. WW is developing new revenue streams in their digital environment and expect to see continued growth.

Undervalued, stagnant prior year, meager 2021 forecast. Yet, the market reaction was positive. 

UP 17.5% after last Thursday's earnings call

P/E of 23.89 compared to ~40 for competitors

Bottom line: after 60 years of operating a weight loss and lifestyle business primarily out of brick and mortar, WW has begun to transform. Hop on while tickets to the moon are still cheap.

Fellow Autists,   
With the coronavirus pandemic ground-pounding the travel industry, I decided to buy into a bunch of  travel stocks, and now about 1 year since the pandemic started I have been getting non-stop adverts from Royal (RCL) and CCL. So I decided to quote some just for shits & giggles, and have found out that CCL is now barely cheaper than RCL with all their discounts. I've always heard that CCL was the least impressive of the two, so with prices that are barely cheaper what would prevent CCL from crashing if people decide to book with RCL or even Norwegian with all that stimmy $$, once travel resumes?

296,296,CRSR insider stock and Stock options Grant Analysis (Bullish ),2021-03-01 23:18:05,"Hello Retards 

Spent Today trying to Find info on Lock up Period (Didn’t Find Anything meaningful) even sent emails to Corsair Investor Relations (Not heard back yet) I started looking into Insider Transactions I stumbled upon Stock Grants being given to all the Senior management.  

I found information on Restricted Stocks and options Grant. If for Example if we analyze CEO SEC Document (I’m sharing links of other Docs, feel free to look at others as well )

He has been given 50,201 Restricted Stock units (Link below at the end) 

The restricted stock units vest as to 25% of the total shares on January 1, 2022; and as to 12.5% of the total shares on each six-month anniversary thereafter, provided that such Restricted Stock Units Recipient provides continuous services through each such vesting date. The restricted stock units have no expiration date.

Additionally, he has been given Stocks options 335,758 Right to buy at 43.05 exercise Price (Stock options give you the right to purchase (exercise) a specified number of shares of the company's stock at a fixed price during a defined timeframe below -

The stock options were granted on February 12, 2021. The options vest and become exercisable as to 25% of the total shares on January 1, 2022; and as to 1/48 of the total shares monthly thereafter, subject to continued service on each such vesting date.

So what it means is Owners also have LEAPS (think of it as Call option with exercise Price of 43.05 Expiration date 02/11/2031) Only Difference they got it for free . 😊

Due to stock Grants, Dilution occurs with restricted stocks upon granting. When employers grant restricted shares, those shares technically belong to the employee, even though employees can only access them upon vesting. Dilution leads to stock Price going down if its not matched by Shares Demand. 

So, I don’t think they are going to sell Shares On or Before March 21 Lockup Period (Which I looked in 8k and other Docs Didn’t Find Any info).  Specially they now have stock options with Exercise Price of ~43 as well as Restricted Stock Units which cannot be exercised before January 1, 2022(that too only partially)

It is good time to enter with shares since Price is low after Dilution and load up on LEAPS.  IV is low.

I would love to hear any feedback. I’m not financial advisor lol.

Vanguard increased Its position in company and BlackRock also owns good stake in Company check below in Link. These guys own shares for very long term.

It's a summer day with clear, blue skies. You are sitting in your car, the newest model G-Gamma 100000 that you have just purchased. Laughter can be heard as your family happily chatters while the car drives, looking forward to the holiday trip that you have planned for them. 

You look out of the window as you sunk deep into thoughts to reminisce about events of the past decades..

During the peak of the GameStop phenomenon in 2021, the market crashed in its entirety, with the exception of GME and a few other stocks. GME rose to hundreds of thousands dollars per share, as the Ultra Omega Squeeze of the millennium, unmatched by any since the start of the Universe, happened. The hedges scrambled enough money as they capitulated, trying cover their shares, but to their utter shock, not a single share could be bought. The shares then rocketed to millions as GameStop's market cap exploded past known limits. 

Throughout the next decades, the management proceeded on an acquisition spree as they transformed into a multi-national, multi-sector, multi-planetary and multi-dimensional mega company focusing on not only e-commerce and gaming, but also entertainment, technology and many others. With this new development, they have managed to take over the landscape of EV and AI industries and even Space Travel industry, and you can now take their Space-bus to other planets 🌙 and back.

Angered, the government tried to intervene, but GameStop has also taken over the military industry and managed to fend off all attacks. By now, GME is worth billions and you can trade in fractions of GME to purchase goods and assets such as houses and cars. 

You break out of your reverie as the car came to a halt. You get out of the car and head into GameStop Resorts World to enjoy a nice holiday with your family.

305,305,How to long Breaking Bad. AMCX fundamentals turnaround story. Potential short/gamma squeeze.,2021-03-02 16:30:03,"AMCX has high potential for a short squeeze, \~50% of float is short and moving up, currently at resistance but not selling off. No one is selling which is bad news for bears.

Conditions are right:

**1) Covering is imminent:**  majority of short positions are red since chart is at a 5 year high and is moving higher

**2) Fundamentals** are in an uptrend. Pivot  to streaming turnaround story is real and the numbers are showing it. They just had a big earnings EPS beat are getting price target upgrades.

**3) Value:** AMC networks is responsible for the best show ever create IMO (Breaking Bad) so that is certainly saying something. Breaking Bad is basically about a man fed up with trying to make it in this fucked up crony capitalism experiment we have going. What better a way to put your money where your mouth is than to long the stock that got so many people thinking about this. Do not underplay the cultural changes that Breaking Bad and other AMC content (Mad Men) have brought to our society. WTF were people even talking about before breaking bad, CSI Miami?

**4) Technicals:** Chart tells me it is currently in the process of squeezing on low volume, if/when volume picks up and attention is brought to this ticker and option volume picks up a gamma squeeze will just add rocketfuel.

**5) Short Data:** My rough estimate of current total short shares is 8.7M (if the data available to retail traders can be trusted, Yahoo Finance, SCANZ), that is \~$600M (at $70 share price) of short positions which will need to be bought back if this keeps going up. 17M float is what my data is telling me (SCANZ). Daily $volumes are way below $100M atm and shorts just keep adding more. Please tell me what I am wrong about cause I am not well versed in this type of data.

AMCX as a company has aired some of the best media content ever created by humans, they are a legitimate undervalued play, they are pivoting their business model and streaming numbers are growing fast. Anyone who thinks a vaccine is somehow going lessen the amount of TV people are watching needs to give their head a shake. A company with this potential should not have a \~50% short float which means it is realistically setup for a short squeeze if shorts refuse to cover their red positions and continue to average down. Likely this was at one point in time a good short play but the fundamentals have changed and so has the chart, all the while with shorts refusing to stop out cover. I will be continuing to pay attention to short numbers as this plays out.

I would love to hear anyone's thoughts on this. Also remember to go easy on me cause I am retarded and this is definitely not a suggestion to buy, I just want to be shown how I am wrong so that I don't yolo on this play. I have a small position and will add a bunch more if some of you autists can confirm that I am not wrong here.

**TL;DR** if you ever wanted to long breaking bad, now is the time.

Edit: to save the ape masses from having to waste their precious monkey breath, I am very aware of the fact that there is another separate company called AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.  with ticker AMC. They are not the topic of this post and am frankly quite sick of hearing about them."

If you are a follower of DKNG, you may have seen the recent double top that we had. This, paired with the indecisive market we have been experiencing, put fear and second thoughts into our head. 

&#x200B;

Our saving grace came from the candle on Feb 23rd. What this candle shows is that we may have had a double top and a concerning market, but DKNG shareholders had faith in the strong-support (purple line), and the buyers outweighed the shorts. From that candle, the chart up to this point came from that momentum created.

&#x200B;

With volume spiking on the daily chart and clearance of the previous double top level, DKNGs next target is the 75.00 range, where we should experience some resistance.

Risky Finance took note of this back in November, writing that regulatory capital had been decreased by as much as $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks due to the feds forbearance measures in response to the virus outbreak..

>**“The biggest forbearance measure was a move by the Fed in May to exclude treasury bonds and** **central bank** **deposits from the leverage exposure measure. That wiped $2 trillion off the** **SLR** **denominator, including $619 billion at JP Morgan alone.""**  
**""Just one of the regulatory changes implemented by the fed in the response to the economic shutdowns would have reduced the denominator (total assets) for calculating the** **SLR** **by $3 trillion for the 6 largest banks (regulatory balance sheets)...""**  
**""...without three critical forbearance measures, some banks such as** **Citigroup** **or Goldman Sachs would have been just 30 basis points away from the minimum, which would prompted the Fed to restrict their trading and lending activity.”**  
[https://www.philstockworld.com/2020/11/05/how-covid-forbearance-gave-banks-a-three-trillion-dollar-boost/](https://www.philstockworld.com/2020/11/05/how-covid-forbearance-gave-banks-a-three-trillion-dollar-boost/)

To calculate the SLR , just divide the Tier 1 Capital by a bank’s assets.

**Tier 1 Capital = reserves, common equity, plus retained earnings and certain instruments with discretionary dividends and no maturity.**

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tier-1-leverage-ratio.asp)

In the past, when the banking industry was much more competitive, it was common for banks to market themselves on their surplus (reserve) in order to attract new customers.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata\_info\_tab\_contents](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1823156?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

Changes to the leverage ratio can lead to very large increases--or decreases--to a banks’ ability to lend. To put that into perspective, according to Thomas Hoenig, a former Vice Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, if share buybacks of $83 billion, representing 72% of total payouts for the top 10 BHCs in 2017, were instead retained, under current capital rules, **this could have increased small business loans by $750 billion, or mortgage loans by almost $ 1.5 trillion...**

[https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/11/07/run-dollar-due-panic-or-greed)

But how does this affect the stock market, you might be wondering?

Well, if J.P. Morgan is going to be adding roughly $619 billion back to the assets used for calculating this leverage ratio, it should theoretically reduce the amount of credit that will be available for investors to speculate. This, of course, would not be a good thing..

[Nick Panigirtzoglou](https://www.google.com/search?q=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&rlz=1C1NHXL_enCA704CA705&oq=Nick+Panigirtzoglou&aqs=chrome..69i57&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), a top analyst at JPM, seemed to support this idea back in November when he argued that lockdowns could actually become a bullish signal because they would increase the likelihood of more quantitative easing from the fed.

>**""Although it has had a negative impact in the short term, the reemergence of lockdowns and resultant growth weakness could bolster the above equity upside over the medium to longer term via inducing more QE and thus more liquidity creation.""**  
[https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/](https://www.nxtmine.com/in-moment-of-brutal-honesty-jpmorgan-says-economic-disaster-and-more-lockdowns-will-be-great-for-stocks/)

If a top analyst at America's largest bank believes that quantitative easing is more important to the stock market than real tangible business activity--even during worldwide pandemic related economic lockdowns--than it only makes sense to assume that any kind of drastic changes to the SLR should also have some kind of impact on equity markets as well.

**May 15, 2020,** **Federal Reserve** **Press Release**

>""For purposes of reporting the supplementary leverage ratio as of June 30, 2020, an electing depository institution may reflect the exclusion of Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from total leverage exposure as if this interim final rule had been in effect for the entire second quarter of 2020. Because the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated as an average over the quarter, this will have the effect of maximizing the effect of the exclusion starting in the second quarter of 2020. The agencies are not making similar adjustments to riskbased capital ratios because Treasuries and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks are risk-weighted at zero percent.""

But again, I'm no expert, it's just with fed policy playing such an important role in market valuations these days, it's hard not to pay attention to what's going on.

Cheers, and hope to hear your thoughts.

Anyway, the rep and I were chatting while he was doing stuff and he mentioned to me that he's been doing nothing but this kind of request because of transferring RH customers that had margin trading on by default and didn't even know until they switched.

Then he also mentioned that Fidelity had more new accounts in 2021 so far -- in 6 weeks -- **than all of 2020**.

Now, Fidelity is a large ass company.  The fact that they got 10x the normal flow of new customers mostly because of RH doesn't sound great for the future of RH.

328,328,Gold/GLD has reached bottom,2021-03-02 15:01:08,"ALCON:   GLD/Gold has reached a new bottom according to my calculations. It is now down about 15% since it's high on August 3rd. It's also down about 11% YTD.

There are other factors going for Gold and PMs as well, not the least of which is ""Basel III"" and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirements that go into effect at the end of June (look it up).

GLD is also the most shorted (by a lot) of all precious metal ETFs. If you want to buy physical gold it will cost about 15%+ more than the paper asset, reasoning is due to market manipulation of the paper asset, whereas the physical asset is forever limited (like alternative currencies); There is only so much Gold on this planet. Every time GLD goes down the spring coil gets tighter.

Expect a nice run up for Gold from now until Nov/Dec this year."

334,334,Doordash Share Lockup Short play,2021-03-02 14:47:54,"There's been some really good DD on a bear case for Doordash recently e.g. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt63fk/dd\_on\_dd\_doordash\_dash\_lockup\_period\_ends\_march/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lt63fk/dd_on_dd_doordash_dash_lockup_period_ends_march/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg8hl5/i\_believe\_i\_have\_found\_lotto\_fds\_and\_other\_puts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg8hl5/i_believe_i_have_found_lotto_fds_and_other_puts/)

There's also a Citron research report here: [https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf) 

I know, I know, Shitron etc etc, but it's worth a read. 

Summary of the bear case:

\-Share lockup ends around March 9th: 

We all saw what happened to the Palantir price after the lockup ended, and that's a good company with a bright future in a big, expanding industry, contracts with the US government and support from investors like Cathie. This is a company in a highly competitive industry with thin margins trading at a wild sales multiple with a load of insiders who are about to be able to sell their shares. 

\- Pandemic ending means restaurants opening back up and fewer people ordering takeout 

\-Food delivery market is shit - terrible margins, very little profit - it's a big market with very little profit

\-Big competitors (Uber Eats etc.) 

\-It's trading at over 20x sales - other competitors like Uber Eats are trading at 3-6x sales 

Bull case: 

\- Pandemic has popularised food delivery; doordash could be here to stay 

\- Stimmy package coming in could further boost stock prices 

Honestly I haven't really got much to say for the bull case, would really appreciate any other input people might have. 

I've never gone full  🌈 🐻 before but it's looking like a pretty convincing case. What are other people's thoughts?"

Gamestonk is popular, my HA has a volume of 56k in this same timeframe.

Why is there so much volume on AMC and what does it mean in comparison to GME which is trading at a rate double most normal stocks?

AMC literally is flying in terms of volume but the stock isn't moving much (in this timeframe). I need a wrinkly brain autistic ape to explain because my baby dick smooth brain tells me volume should be a positive thing but neither AMC or GME are moving.

My aal and ha are moving on much lower volume.  

I don't feel that retailers are selling either stonk.

Educate this ape who owns more AMC than GME but has both."
337,337,I did 3.5k more on top 4k. I've offclly lost it guys. Those that r still using RH & u been setting limit sells @ 1k so hedgies can't use ur shares while driving the price up BE CAREFUL! They made me think my order went thru when it was actlly rejected by lowering the highest limit price to $900 🧐,2021-03-01 19:00:59,
338,338,"While the GME rocket is preparing for launch, hedge funds are likely shorting other stocks and placing calls on GME",2021-03-01 00:10:39,"We've already seen how badly the markets did as GME suddenly did incredibly well last week. Hedge Funds and shorters of GME had to liquidate other investments in order to do their aggressive short ladder attacks on GME.

Yet with all the action around GME, and with the current state of the world, if GME does moon, many other stocks will come crashing down as shorters are forced to cover their positions.

And this is how hedge funds will win no matter what happens;

They've already set up GME to take off with how much aggressive shorting has been happening.

When the GME rocket takes off, they'll hold shorts on other stocks while holding calls on GME and make huge money off all market activity.

And while GME moons, retail traders and other hedge funds/investors that got on the GME rocket will win BIG TIME.

Yet at the same time, many of the rest of the stocks will crash and cause many to lose big time.

I wouldn't be surprised if enough insider trading is happening to have a planned date for when GME will take off so that they can time the markets perfectly and make sure as few retail traders are on the rocket as possible.

**TL:DR; It's just like the movie 2012, but hedge funds will benefit whether the world ends or not.**"

342,342,Which Call Contracts Creates The Best Chances For Another Gamma Squeeze,2021-03-01 17:56:28,"In the first GME squeeze, we saw 4 gamma squeezes leading up to the climax in late Jan early Feb. These squeezes took place over the course of the whole month of Jan. Starting with the squeeze that shot the price up from 20 to 50, then to 100 and then two more in the weeks leading up to Robinhood fucking us.

The gamma squeeze worked as a catalyst the first time around and it's probably our biggest ally going into this second run through. Gamma is at it's highest when the price of the stock is at the strike price of the option contract. So the best way to increase the chances of a gamma squeeze is to buy calls that are OTM but not too far OTM. so with a market price of 110, buying up calls with strike prices between 110 to 160 is good. 

For a better explanation of why this is, read this: [https://investorscult.com/2021/03/01/which-call-contracts-facilitate-a-gamma-squeeze-the-most-for-gme/](https://investorscult.com/2021/03/01/which-call-contracts-facilitate-a-gamma-squeeze-the-most-for-gme/) 

Also, one thing to note is trading your deep ITM calls for OTM calls may reduce the delta hedge necessary reducing the amount of GME needed to be bought by market makers. 

tl;dr buy OTM calls with a strike price near market price to increase chances of a gamma squeeze. And avoid trading deep ITM calls for deep OTM calls. Not financial advice."
