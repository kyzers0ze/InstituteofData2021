Thank you!",2021-02-28 18:40:58,"My brother and I were both soldiers, but he didn't make it out uninjured. He was assigned to Bagdad, and was a turret gunner in a quick response unit. On a slow day, as they were rounding a corner near a square, an IED was triggered sending the humvee into the air and catapulting him 60ft. They thought he was dead, and after securing the area realized he was alive. They flew him to Germany, then to Walter Reed, where he eventually wore up and was told he'd never walk, and that they had resected some of his lover and intestines.

After a year in a wheel chair, and working hard every day, he was able to walk again, then run. I remember him telling me he couldn't wait to get back to his unit. The Army medically retired him though, and he went into a deep depression, with which he struggled for a number of years. He eventually graduated from college with an engineering degree, but his accomplishments were overshadowed by his PTSD.

About 2 months ago, i showed him r/wallstreetbets and the dd that people were doing on the gme stock. He YOLO'd his savings and sold half at 302,giving him enough to pay off his mortgage!

Anyway, the rep and I were chatting while he was doing stuff and he mentioned to me that he's been doing nothing but this kind of request because of transferring RH customers that had margin trading on by default and didn't even know until they switched.

Then he also mentioned that Fidelity had more new accounts in 2021 so far -- in 6 weeks -- **than all of 2020**.

Now, Fidelity is a large ass company.  The fact that they got 10x the normal flow of new customers mostly because of RH doesn't sound great for the future of RH.

30,"While the GME rocket is preparing for launch, hedge funds are likely shorting other stocks and placing calls on GME",2021-03-01 00:10:39,"We've already seen how badly the markets did as GME suddenly did incredibly well last week. Hedge Funds and shorters of GME had to liquidate other investments in order to do their aggressive short ladder attacks on GME.

Yet with all the action around GME, and with the current state of the world, if GME does moon, many other stocks will come crashing down as shorters are forced to cover their positions.

And this is how hedge funds will win no matter what happens;

They've already set up GME to take off with how much aggressive shorting has been happening.

When the GME rocket takes off, they'll hold shorts on other stocks while holding calls on GME and make huge money off all market activity.

And while GME moons, retail traders and other hedge funds/investors that got on the GME rocket will win BIG TIME.

Yet at the same time, many of the rest of the stocks will crash and cause many to lose big time.

I wouldn't be surprised if enough insider trading is happening to have a planned date for when GME will take off so that they can time the markets perfectly and make sure as few retail traders are on the rocket as possible.

**TL:DR; It's just like the movie 2012, but hedge funds will benefit whether the world ends or not.**"
31,Big gains will only matter when you have good financial health,2021-02-28 16:42:22,"Alright fellow apes, in light of everything going on with our glorious meme stonks, we need to take some time to reflect upon our financial literacy and health. This is so that when we‚Äôre able to squeeze the big boys out of their billions, our gains will actually matter.

[It is a fact that the vast majority of lottery winners lose all their winnings, even go bankrupt, within a few years of receiving their winnings.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-lottery/2019/12/27/742b9662-2664-11ea-ad73-2fd294520e97_story.html)

In other words, if we don‚Äôt use our gains wisely, they‚Äôre just going to go back to the big guys that are screwing us over.

So here‚Äôs some simple yet solid financial advice from rich people that can help you keep and grow whatever gains you‚Äôll be getting within these next few months;

# 1.) Have a strict budget.

One of the most common budgets for wealthy people is this ;

**50%** of their money goes towards **necessities** (rent/board/mortgage, groceries, utilities, insurance, transportation, etc.)

**20-30%** goes into **investments**

**10-20%** goes into an **emergency fund** they can access quickly

**10%** goes towards **wants** (entertainment, restaurants, treats, etc.)

Again, not everyone can follow this budget to a T, and some don‚Äôt have to. But it will be important to budget your income and gains into these four separate categories in whichever way works best for you so that you can have strong financial health.

# 2.) Prepare for taxes

If your gains are big enough, and unless you‚Äôre going to keep them all in a tax-free account, you‚Äôre going to have to study up on what tax rates will apply to you and your gains.

For example, if you get $1.5M, and the tax rate for those sort of gains is 33%, only use the $1M and save aside the other $0.5M solely for taxes.

# 3.) If your gains are big enough, hire a financial advisor from a trusted institute

Anyone who makes huge amounts of money will be wise to hire someone that can help them understand what to do with it.

So if your gains are too overwhelming for you, and your first instincts are to instantly buy all the things you‚Äôve ever wanted, you will actually be wise to calm yourself down and do your research on who you can trust with your money.

DO NOT follow the financial advice of anyone that comes to you. YOU must go to THEM.

This leads me to my next point;

# 4.) Expect scammers, beggars, and family to come out of the woodwork if you make your gains public

There are people who dedicate their lives to manipulating others to get what they want. And if you make your wealth public by either telling everyone about your gains, or flashing your wealth around, you will become a prime target to some of the scummiest, two-faced con artists on Earth.

Even family and friends can suddenly show up and subtly ask you for money. They may not be doing this on purpose or out of sheer selfish desire; it‚Äôs just human nature.

This also leads me into my final point;

# 5.) Prepare for your entire life to change.

Your personal, relationship, and work life will all change whether you like it or not with your new big gains.

Prepare for the transition to be stressful, to challenge everything you know and are, and for you to need to re-evaluate your relationships with others as well as your purpose in life.

Again, the vast majority of people live most of their lives working hard just to get by. Now that money is less of an issue, that changes everything.

# 6.) Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre still human

You are not a genius or a God now that you have this wealth. You can still bleed, and you will die just like everyone else will.

This also means that your greatest satisfaction and joys in life will not come from your wealth or the things you can now buy that most can only dream about buying.

It comes from the little things.

It comes from giving.

It comes from living in and for love.

And if you forget about it, you‚Äôll only become the very kind of people that we‚Äôre fighting against."

Or it it?

The specifics around the whole Melvin/Robinhood part is, and the new landscape of the internet making data (good or bad) more accessible to the masses will certainly be creating new rules about how the markets function. But, in the pure form of a short squeeze this is in fact a case of ""there's nothing new under the sun.""

Most have become familiar with the Volkswagen squeeze that occurred in 2008, as it has been touted as the most direct short squeeze comparison. Chart photo below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/st5n6zjngck61.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b5f0c118efebc43b115246a09e10744c01eee1

Tesla has also been compared to the GameStop situation but that was arguably a slower burn and to be fair had been on a steady march upward leading to the explosive growth in 2020.

But there is another squeeze that occurred in 1901 that might provide a better comparison to GameStop not in terms of its cause and setup, but the potential secondary effect.

**The Great Panic of 1901**

Leading up to 1901 the Union Pacific railroad had been on an acquisition tear becoming the largest rail player in the West under the leadership of Edward Henry Herriman and backed by a syndicate that included the likes of Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Goulds, Ameses and Kuhn, Loed &amp; Co. (read as ""people who don't like to lose"").

But, in order to expand East a key acquisition had to be made. That acquisition was the Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad. However, James Hill through the backing of J.P. Morgan (also read as ""someone who doesn't like to lose""), controlled the Northern Pacific Railroad and had similar ideas for expansion.

A back and forth of bidding war for the Burlington Railway ensued which ended in Hill being chosen and Hill proposing a Burlington and Northern Pacific merger. But, Hill and Morgan did not hold outright ownership of Northern Pacific and collectively held roughly 23% interest. Believing that the $155M or so needed to gain the controlling stake in Northern was of no issue they pressed on with the Burlington merger.

Meanwhile, Harriman quietly began buying the majority of Northern's preferred shares and about $37M in common stock putting him within 40,000 common shares of control.

On May 6th, after getting tipped off of the activity, Hill and Morgan began frantically buying up common shares on the open market to block this attempt sending the share price from $110 to $130. Not wanting to announce their activity, great effort was put towards masking their buying and the general market remained unaware of the tug and war that was occurring between the two railway giants.

Believing that the price hike was artificial, traders began shorting the Northern Pacific stock.

Here is an excerpt from *The American Magazine 1907* to give an idea of the climate at the time, it carries some similarities to today:

*""It is important to understand the mood of the time. Ordinary investors had recently been worked into a frenzy as U.S. Steel shares were promoted and railroad stocks were rising fast on various rumors of insider accumulations and mergers. Lefevre recounts a ""raging public speculation in stocks"" while Clew talks of a ""restless sea of reckless stock speculation that swept the American people into its vortex, with all its razzle-dazzle extravagance.""""*

By the next day the Northern Pacific shares were up to $150 and short sellers were weighing whether to close the position and take the loss or to liquidate other holdings to remain solvent. The following day, that decision was forced upon them as the stock climbed to $200.

By this point Hill had successfully seized control, yet neither side was going to sell and jeopardize what they each believed to be the controlling stake. As the market realized there was not going to be enough share volume to close short positions the price climbed to $1000 a share. Fearing the deadline to deliver, short sellers began dumping everything to cover their Pacific Northern losses and margin rates spiked to 60% only compounding the issue.

This created a panic in the broader market and following the lead of the short sellers the entire market sold off. The short sellers lost somewhere between $40M-$70M in the mayhem but those who sold in the broader market dip got burned as well.

Overall, the total pain felt was short lived and smaller than it could have been. Realizing what was occurring Hill and Harriman reached a truce and agreed to allow positions to be closed out at $160 a share. This allowed markets to stabilize and return to previous levels, not to mention save some of the short sellers from ruin.

**How Does This Mimic Today?**

An interesting take away from this story that has some value in today's situation is first that margin played a key role in causing a broader sell off and second that the stabilization came from two whales calling a cease fire.

Today margin is at a record level, almost at the COMBINED amounts leading up to the internet and housing bubbles, even after adjusting for inflation.

Some data on these levels further down in the post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueSqueeze/comments/lpftk7/investor_gardening_101_know_when_its_time_to/)

So, should the GameStop situation run away to a sufficient level, we can expect the incentive to sell due to margin will work its magic. Kind of like dry wood building up in a forest waiting for a fire.

A bit of an instance of ""correlation does not equal causation,"" but it seems that when GameStop goes up the broader market does tend to sell off.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wb2hq9pqgck61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a603988fe3cad8c2ddc2e03ad205f3de2b1b83f4

Some statistical data I've seen from various sources keeps landing at about a -0.50 correlation to the indices with a T-stat of &lt; 0.05, which means a low likelihood of random chance correlation.

Eh, maybe a stretch but I bet the inverse correlation gets stronger as GameStop goes from $200 to $400 to $800 etc.

*Now for the scary part,* in the above example two whales met in the middle to call an end to all of the madness. I suspect there will be no such ""bailout"" in today's case. A quick review of the sentiment around the GameStop revolution shows that convincing a diverse population of shareholders who see this as more of a crusade rather than merely a profit endeavor is going to be an uphill battle should the price keep rising.

And good on them, but should 1901 repeat itself the SEC may have to force some hands. We've already seen brokers take matters into their own hands.

**How Not to Burn Your Hands and Maybe Get a Chance to Profit**

If you are profit motivated, you could of course try and time an entry into GameStop if you expect the squeeze has not happened and that the best is yet to come.

But, assuming the above is a good proxy for what could happen, might that be the best way to approach the situation?

If you are on board for the revolution by all means take what money you can afford to lose and join the cause. But, for those dollars above and beyond this amount, the ones you have to make calculated bets with, can some second order thinking provide fantastic risk adjusted returns?

**The easy way** would be to mimic what a certain Bernard Baruch (a trader on the floor at the time) did in 1901. A quote from him during the panic:

*""On the Exchange floor fear had completely taken the place of reason. Stocks were being dumped wildly, dropping from ten to twenty points. There were rumors of corners in other stocks \[in addition to Northern\].""*

Baruch realized what was going on and he bought heavily in the drop. He knew great companies were being sold at fire sale prices and he took full advantage.

To follow his lead in today's situation would be to have some DD already done on companies you'd love to own, make sure the cash is available and see if some fireworks happen.

**The hard way** would be to actually put on a short. Which does not have to be done *prior* to some positive movement from GameStop. But ask yourself, in a selloff situation what is likely to happen?

Most probable would be a flight to safety. So, if you are a trader, going short growth companies as GameStop makes some serious moves upward may be the safest short equity bet. Historically speaking people are most eager to let go of those companies that have yet to grow into their multiples (think high P/E ratios).

Regardless of the method that works best for you, which of course depends on existing positions, risk tolerance, etc. the current situation has the potential to create a low risk high reward outcomes as a secondary effect. We already have a historical data point to look to and the dry tinder waiting behind that one was a fraction of what we have today.

Some thought put towards a response to this possible outcome may prove to be profitable. And for those solely seeing this as a movement, that secondary effect would still mostly be at the expense of the institutions.

Food for thought."
36,Wondering where to set your sell limit for GME? Worried about missing the squeeze? Please read.,2021-02-28 13:57:19,"First off, welcome to Wendys! Where our advice isn‚Äôt financial, and our burgers are stuffed with crayons!

I‚Äôve been watching people recently scream *100K IS NOT A MEME* into the void over and over again, so I decided to break out of my lurker shell for those of us wondering if 100k is actually a meme, aren‚Äôt sure where to set the sell limit, and are afraid they are going to miss the train to tendie town. If you‚Äôve been wrinkling your forehead thinking about this hoping a wrinkle will transfer to your brain, this is the post for you.

I‚Äôve pulled some numbers from the Volkswagen squeeze to hopefully give some comfort to those apes who (like me) wandered around completely lost about where to set their sell *(gasp)* limits. I know GME isn‚Äôt Volkswagen, but if somebody can find me a closer comparison, that would be great!

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*

I‚Äôve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don‚Äôt line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.

Here we go.

October 2nd: $263

October 3rd: $277

October 6th: $292

October 7th: $287

October 8th: $294

October 9th: $296

October 10th: $342

October 13th: $353

October 14th: $352

October 15th: $390

October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --&gt; **NOT THE SQUEEZE**

October 17th: $358

October 20th: $277

October 21st: $242

October 22nd: $243

October 23rd: $229

October 24th: $210

October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.

*BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn‚Äôt* the squeeze.

*Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you‚Äôll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you‚Äôd still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.

Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn‚Äôt matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don‚Äôt risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.

Absolute worst case scenario is that you‚Äôre in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.

Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.

**TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn‚Äôt just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.

41,Why I love the AMC Stock,2021-03-01 01:04:03,"Sorry if my English is not the best. I'm from Germany ü§êü§£

A simple Reason why I think we should all go in AMC without nearly any cares about losses and hold it. 

The Value is very low now and we all know what's going on this time so we have a very huge chance to make a huge amount of money and even if this gamma squeeze won't happen in near future we will win or at least go out without losses.

AMC has many Cinemas around the globe and everyone loves going to the cinema. After the Covid-bullshit when they can open again with full capacity, the company can earn money again and has a good chance to grow again in long term and we all can take our money back. Maybe one month, maybe one year, who knows. 

And please remember the rumors about the corporations with Amazon and Netflix. 

That's why I use every penny I can get to buy and hold AMC until we reach the Andromeda Galaxy. 

But that's NOW. If Monday everybody starts to think like this and buy before the price reaches unrealistic dimensions to get it back, it can be a little more struggle psychologically. 

I will use the low price at this time to build out my position and enjoy this ride into the core of singularity like I've seen in the Interstellar movie. 

I'm not a financial advisor, just saying, but I'm very proud of my ape family and full of confidence and love for everyone of you. ‚ù§Ô∏èüêµü¶çüíéüëêüíéüëêüíéüëêüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"

If you haven't already, you should read it.

Linked here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)

Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and before RKT got the earnings boost, valued at MORE than üöÄüöÄüöÄ, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's another little DD summary I found:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx\_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit)

&amp;#x200B;

If you were too lazy to read either of those, know that RKT has 40% short interest. 40 PERCENT. THE SHORT BORROWING FEE IS 80%

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT](https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT)

&amp;#x200B;

This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by Friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

YES. YOU READ THAT RIGHT. üö®üö® 5 DAYS UNTIL THEY HAVE TO COVER OR COUGH UP THE DIVIDEND

üö®üö® THIS IS NOT A DRILL. WE HAVE AN ACTUAL SHORT EXPIRATION DATE üö®üö®

&amp;#x200B;

To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.

This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's also targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.

I'd link the interview, but reddit won't let me for a DD post.

TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY üö®FRIDAYüö® and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK. Retail/WSB buying pressure on RKT would üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ it to the ABSOLUTE üåïüåïüåï.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally imagine an epic runup until Friday, which could then also pop a gamma squeeze while we're at it.

&amp;#x200B;

The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.

Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 109, $35 C 1/21/2022 x5.

I will personally be buying any dips that occur if I find an exit opportunity for my other positions. Maybe do some averaging up üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Not financial advice üöÄüöÄüöÄ

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: If you're confused about why 3/5 when the ex-dividend date is 3/9, here is a source to my claim that because of T+2 settlement you must own by Friday.

[https://finance.zacks.com/settlement-date-occur-before-exdividend-date-receive-dividend-6289.html](https://finance.zacks.com/settlement-date-occur-before-exdividend-date-receive-dividend-6289.html)

Ex-Dividend Date

One factor complicating the discussion of the dividend date is settlement. When you purchase a stock, it takes three business days for ownership to be transferred. This transfer of ownership is referred to as settlement. Therefore, you have to purchase the stock at least three business days before the record date to receive a dividend. Assume the record date is June 4. If you buy the stock on June 1, you will own it on June 4 and be entitled to receive a dividend. However, if you buy it on Tuesday or later, ownership transfer will occur after the record date and you will not be paid a dividend. June 2 is therefore referred to as the ex-dividend date; in other words, the first day on which buyers will no longer be entitled to a dividend."

46,"Market Maker's Delta Exposure is over 25m shares, and how it will accelerate the short squeeze to legendary levels.",2021-02-28 22:45:16,"Yesterday I published my findings of how many shares MMs need to own in order to be delta neutral. However, I only went to march 19th as I naively assumed that there was not enough open interest to significantly affect their exposure.

I was wrong.

Their exposure is over **25 million shares.**

This can only mean two things: They own millions of shares AND calls, or they **ARE NOT DELTA NEUTRAL.**

Market Makers MUST be delta neutral in their position, which means even at the low price of 101$, they must own massive amounts of shares and calls or they must purchase them. This implies that Market Makers are walking the tight line of causing a massive gamma squeeze the likes of which we have never seen, or **half the float is locked up to hedge.**

If they use calls to hedge, they will dig their own grave as it will push the price higher as other market makers need to start covering massive amounts of ITM calls. **This means that if they bought ITM calls to hedge, it will accelerate the gamma squeeze.**

So, what should they do? Do they **buy 25m shares?** or do they buy massive amounts of call options (we are talking in excess of 250k calls) and **accelerate the gamma squeeze?**

I personally only see two outcomes, one as the stock rises it will become more and more volatile as shares get locked up to hedge, or we are the cusp of seeing a massive gamma squeeze. **Both outcomes will exasperate the short squeeze.**

47,"GME, Comparing Volume (Options, Equity) and Closing Price For the Past 4 Months",2021-03-01 07:02:45,"Apes,

I am seeing a lot of posts/videos in regards to predicting the date of the squeeze.  
As much as I enjoy solid DD as the next guy, I must draw the line somewhere and provide a healthy dose of skepticism.  
First off, fuck *most* of these YouTube clout chasers who are doing nothing but spreading false hope and bad information. Cucks like that data scientist, Meet Kevin and the rest don't know jack shit. Unless they show a sizeable position in GME, their words hold zero weight.

DFV backed up his words with actions.  
Credibility should be earned, not given.

**I pulled some data from the following sources below:**

1. Options Volume Source:  [https://www.cboe.com/us/options/market\_statistics/historical\_data/](https://www.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/historical_data/) 
2. Daily Volume / Closing Price:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1601510400&amp;period2=1614470400&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1601510400&amp;period2=1614470400&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true) 

It appears to me there's a common sentiment that the week with the highest options volume is the week of the squeeze.

***See the chart I created below***  


https://preview.redd.it/5wg5929v3dk61.png?width=1305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c479e688b1d7dc892d0cb47af6a69dfff052c600

**What this chart tells us, is that the second to last week of JAN had the highest options volume.**  
**It was the subsequent week where the real squeeze should've occurred** (*if not for RH/SEC/DTCC/Citadel/etc...*)

I understand the ETF re-balancing for XRT also occurs MAR-19, *joined* with the heavy options volume could potentially be all that's needed to start the squeeze.  
However, it is still my belief that the squeeze will occur once the shorts have hit their regulatory leverage limit and SEC RULE 204 comes into play.  
[https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)  


The options volume is one factor, but I don't think it should be the main or determining one.  
I wouldn't put too much weight on this variable, please feel free to disagree and provide logical rebuttals in the comments.

For anyone that doubts my credibility, feel free to dig through my past posts.  
I still have a large position in GME and will hold until the end of time.  


***TL;DR***   
1. If you truly subscribe to the notion that you can predict a date for the squeeze, put your money where your mouth is and post some YOLO 3/19 GME calls. 

2. Options volume shouldn't be the main variable in predicting the squeeze in my opinion."

53,AMC,2021-02-28 20:36:14,"This is not financial advice**
AMC as we all know closed about the $8 mark on Friday the 26th (closed at $8.01). Because of this, over 18,000 call options were able to be executed due to the fact they were in the money. This means that 1,800,000 shares of AMC will be purchased as a result. On Friday, we also saw a call option volume of over 300,000 contracts meaning that hedge funds/sellers of these contracts will need to buy 100 shares per contract in order to hedge the position. This is how a gamma squeeze is formed. Through the massive amount of buys for this particular share. 

On top of this AMC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market with a short interest similar to GameStop‚Äôs. It is also one of the most active stocks in terms of daily volume. With that said, AMC had potential to form a short squeeze on top of the gamma squeeze that is going to occur this upcoming week. This has the potential to his not $10, $20, $30 per share but above $100 per share if we all hold our shares. There will be information put out to scare us into selling. There will be ladder attacks to bring the price down. But all we have to do is hold. 

Holding this stock will force hedge funds and those shorting the stock to buy at whatever price we are willing to sell for. If we all hold we win. There are now over 9 million members of this group and we all feel as though we have been wronged by actions on Wall Street and the constant manipulation of prices. But this time we will win. We hold we win it is really that simple. Let‚Äôs make history together."

59,Here's why I think $AMC is solid (long) bet,2021-03-01 09:31:20,"Edit: TLDR $AMC 500@$8; $GME 300@$145

First things first... I don't think this really counts as DD because I'm making assumptions based on a very specific subset of data. Second, this obviously isn't financial advice, etc. Third, I'm not a bot trying to distract from $GME, I'm in $GME 300@145, I just think $AMC is worth some cash. Fourth, nothing I'm about to say has anything to do with any kind of squeeze, it's just about the market and a long position.

Now for the opinions, gross generalizations and shoddy extrapolations:

In every downturn there is (at least) one thing that has always done well, and that's film. Why? Well, in my opinion, it's because going to the movies is a relatively cheap luxury. In 2000 and 2009, people didn't stop going to the movies. AMC, for example, saw a 4% annual drop in 2008 (April-March), but bounced back up in 2009 (April-March), and there weren't very many industries which only saw a 4% drop. People who could afford $350 Blue Man Group tickets in January 2008, may not have been able to afford those tickets a year later, but they could sure afford $10 in June 2009 to go see Transformers. Cinemark (Regal) didn't even see a 08-09 dip.

Box office revenue in 2019 was $11.4bn, and it dropped 80% to $2.28bn in 2020, because this downturn is different, it's not about people not having money, it's about us not being able to be closer to each other. 

Enter vaccines. I don't know when going to the movies will feel normal again, but eventually it will, and my guess is it will be sometime before the end of 2021. Now, there's a lot of big talk about what people are gonna do as soon as they're vaccinated: trips to Bali, trips to Majorca, licking doorknobs... But who really has the funds to blow on these trips or enough doorknobs to make it worth their time? Maybe some of you gain-porn assholes on wsb (just jealous), but for everyone else who got laid off, fired or is just still struggling to survive at $40k/year, where are they gonna go? To the fucking movies, and after the last year, we're all gonna be like idiots packing into Valhalla to breathe in other people's sneezes and eat popcorn that's had 10 different hands in it.

There's a good chance that I'll be totally wrong, but I think 2022 is going to be the biggest box office year on record and AMC is the biggest player. All they have to do is hang on a little longer, and they'll slay. With that being said, the stock market is a ponzi scheme where stock price can be manipulated and is rarely linked to actual performance (see: $AMC pre-2020), but I think people are going to be thinking about and excited about going back to the movies, which will push up the value.

To those who might be thinking: but with so many streaming options, who's going to go to the movies anymore?!? I don't care how big your tv is, or how great your sound bar sounds, it's not the same as going to the movies. I don't remember very many films I watched at home as a child, but I sure as shit remember going to opening night of Batman (Keaton) with my parents, because it was an experience... The excitement, the anticipation, the murmur as the lights dim, the fun of a communal response to jump scares... You all remember being around people right? Watching movies at home is fun, but it's just not the same as a night out at the movies and a family of four can do it for ~$60. Right now, I'd pay $60 to go to the movies by myself just to feel alive again.

Anyways, you all do what you want. I'm long on $GME and I'm long on $AMC. They might pop in the next month, but I think they're gonna go up and stay up in the long run (and I'm more bullish on AMC's long term prospects than GME, until I see a new strategy). I'm not buying for the pop, I'm buying for them gainz. How many people wish they would have held their Amazon, Apple or Tesla stock beyond the pops? I'm saying this next part as much for myself as for any other ape: quit obsessing over the ticker and get back to work so you can earn more money to buy more shares... If I like the stock today (I like the stock), I'm still gonna like it next month. And remember the old saying: what one ape can do, so too can another.

Good luck everyone. Try to relax this week.

60,GME IS A MEME STOCK,2021-02-28 09:51:26,"I‚Äôve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I‚Äôm just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...

Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING

Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn‚Äôt matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. 

Longer version:

There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. 

GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It‚Äôs abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. 

GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it‚Äôs why we can do this. You don‚Äôt need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn‚Äôt new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won‚Äôt lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. 


Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don‚Äôt remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. 

I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs what hedge funds are doing. It‚Äôs all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. 

Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don‚Äôt look for a made up catalyst. It‚Äôs right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. 

I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God‚Äôs work (not religious just an expression). I‚Äôll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). 

This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that‚Äôs interpretation. 

I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!

I hope all newcomers see this...

Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how ‚ÄúGameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that‚Äôs why shorties keep coming back to ‚Äòsqueeze‚Äô‚Äù but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!

64,AMC Gamma Squeeze,2021-02-28 23:25:07,"As a disclaimer, I did not partake in the initial AMC or GME or any meme stock rally from January, and I am not bagholding any positions from that rally. I bought into AMC 3/12 15Cs on Thursday and Friday because of what I noticed.

First we'll start with a brief description of what a gamma squeeze is. Long story short, all it is is there are a lot of calls that were bought, and those call options are ITM and are either expiring and/or being exercised, which forces the stock price to go higher as options writers now need to cover their position. [https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze](https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze) is an article that explains it in depth.

On Thursday 2/25, from about 2:23PM EST to 2:40PM EST, I saw a HUGE influx of AMC call options being bought, nearly $5.6M worth of call options, the total number of contracts bought was 22,740 contracts, were bought in a 17 minute time frame. I had never seen such activity in my life. This is where things get interesting. 15,539 out of the 22,740 total options were AMC 2/26 6.5Cs. The remaining 7,201 contracts were AMC 2/26 7Cs. 

Here is a breakdown of the orders:

**AMC 2/26 6.5C**

Total Premium Paid: $3,971,000

Total Size: 15,539 contracts

Right to purchase: 1,553,900 shares @ 6.5 per share for a total cost of $10,100,350

**AMC 2/26 7C**

Total Premium Paid: $1,582,000

Total Size: 7,201 contracts

Right to purchase: 720,100 shares @ 7 per share for a total cost of $5,040,700 

Immediately I thought that AMC was going to have an EOD rally and that these weeklies would print insane and that's why they came in with such volume in such a small time frame, but I was wrong, there wasn't any EOD rally. This kinda shocked me, because who would buy millions of dollars worth of weeklies in such a manner if it wasn't for a day trade? But then it hit me, these were all very ITM calls, and ALL these orders came in as **split orders**. For those who don't know what a split order is, it is a type of order for large securities transactions that is divided into smaller orders and it is done to prevent large fluctuations in the market price. [https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:\~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security](https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security). is article if you are interested in learning more about split orders. This is when it hit me, holy shit, these calls HAD to be bought to be exercised!! Why in the world would there be such large buyers, within such a small time frame, buy so many ITM weekly calls, \*and the cherry on top\* as split orders just to stop the market price from fluctuating then and there? GAMMA SQUEEZE THAT'S WHY.

And this is where I wrap this up folks. AMC is still one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, and AMC still has been extremely active in terms of share volume on a daily basis. On top of that, NYC movie theaters open up again next month too, which is fundamentally great for AMC. AMC had very heavy call buying for the 6.5Cs and 7Cs all week, with more volume being concentrated in the 6.5Cs, and AMC closed well above this on Friday (AMC closed at 8.20 to be exact). Those calls were most likely bought to be exercised, so many shorts have to cover or did already cover. This should propel AMC stock price this week, hopefully forcing an insane gamma squeeze.

**TLDR:** On 2/25 big boys bought a crap ton, millions of dollars worth, of AMC 6.5 and 7 weekly calls in literally 17 minutes via split orders, and these calls were likely to be exercised. AMC closed well above 6.5, where most of the call volume was, and because they expired ITM those contracts will be exercised and a crap ton of shares was bought squeezing those option writers and forcing them to cover, in such a manner that we should see an epic gamma squeeze this week."
65,Market Cap explained for new Apes,2021-03-01 11:21:06,"There's been a bit of FUD thrown around saying that GME won't hit 100k because the market cap will be too big etc, so here's a really simple explanation as to what market cap actually is and what it is used for..

Market Cap is the last traded price multiplied by the amount of shares in existence.

So if a company issues 1 million shares, and the share price trades at $10, the market cap is $10 million. This does not mean that the company is worth $10 million. nor does it mean that $10 million has been invested in the company.

All market cap is useful for is to rank companies against each other.

Another way to look at it..

I could create my own cryptocurrency, and issue 1 million units. I then sell 1 unit to my wife's boyfriend for $10, and all of a sudden the market cap is $10 million. Only $10 has traded hands yet it has a gigantic market cap.

So I hope you can all see now that market cap means nothing really. It's only use is to compare and rank. It has no impact on our ability to hit $100k and beyond."

71,A quick reasonable and logic explanation on what is currently happening to GME,2021-03-01 00:08:28,"Hi guys,

all the following informations are out of uncle bruce latest youtube video. I can't post a link in here as the automod directly deletes the post but just search for ""GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On!"" if you are interested in the 17 minutes original video I got my informations from.

I'm just quickly recapping everything he says for those of you that are too lazy or retarded to watch the video. **TLDR and theoretical outlook at the bottom.**

Fictional example:

Hedgefund A shorted 1 Million shares at 120$ which means he sold 1M shares at 120$. The price goes down to 100$. In order to close the short position he has to buy back the 1M shares and return them to his MM. His profit is the difference between 120$ and 100$ times 1M: 20M $. In theory this sounds pretty simple but buying back 1M shares in a tightly packed and balanced buyers/sellers market causes a huge overhang in favor of the buyer side. More buyers then sellers = stonk goes up. By the time you bought 400.000 individual shares back, the price has gone back up to 125$ because people notice there is a huge whale buying a lot of shares. If you would keep on buying back all your shares until you reached your 1M shares to close your short position you have driven the price up to 135$ (just an example). Your average price is somewhere around 125-130 $ (again just a guess don't nail me on this one). The whole maneuver now costs you around 5-10M $ because your average buy back price is higher then your original short position. **You can't do that because your short position is so large that closing it would require you to buy so many shares that the stock goes above your short entry point which makes the deal nonsense.**

What you do instead: you go to the chicago option exchange and you get 20.000 ITM calls @, for example; 60$ which expire tonight. Normally such amounts of calls aren't exercised because most of the people don't exercise their shares because they don't have the money to do so but you are a massive HF you shit millions a month. As those calls aren't properly hedged because everyone is greedy and nobody thought that this meme-stock would actually rise again, the option MM now has to deliver 2M shares to HF A. They might have a quarter of those 2M but they still have to buy 1,5M back from the market. HF A uses 1M shares to close his short position and with the other 1 M he goes long because he somehow knows that the option guys fucked up OR because he knows that other shorters are doing the same. HF B, C, D also get a a lot of calls to close their short positions at whatever price. Suddenly there are a lot of calls getting exercised. Many option MM have to buy back shares at the market. HF A waits for the option MM to buy all the shares for their calls which drives up the price. Option MM then deliver the 2M shares. HF A closes his short position and sells the other million of shares while price is going up to 170-200 because other option MM are keeping the buying power coming. They closed their short position and made additional bucks through their newly gained long position.

Many people in here are assuming that most of the options get hedged but this doesn't seem to be the case. Otherwise there wouldn't be such a huge buying power of the last days. There was a huge 240M share volume in two days. There are big institutional players involved which are trying to buy million of shares or in other words: NAKED call options that get exercised in large quantities. There are several hundred thousand of options in between the 60-100 price range. As the stock went down throughout the last month there were dozens of million shares shorted at some point. All those short positions have to be covered at some point in order to make profit out of them. This big buying wave might just been a first wave of option makers trying to cover the call options that are used by HF to cover their short positions that were created throughout the whole month of february and in the end of january. This buying frenzy from option makers caused other options to be in ITM which were bought by HF just on the day of their expiry which allows them to close more previous short positions.

**TLDR for TLDR as requested:**
Option makers fucked up through naked/badly hedged calls that are now ITM and used by HF to cover their profitable short positions. 

**TLDR:** Insanely high amounts of mostly naked or badly hedged call options are exercised because HFs are trying to close their short positions that are several million shares huge, without driving up the price through creating a buyer overhang. OR in other words: the HFs are handing over the bag to the chicago option makers which now have to deliver million of exercised call options at a huge price range that they never thought of actually being exercised in those quantities.

**Outlook:** as I understood bruce right - this process isn't over yet. Many call options expired at the end of friday and if several ten thousand call options are naked or badly hedged then this would cause the options MM to buy even more shares. As the price went up to 100$ - there are a lot of call options ITM now, that weren't previously in the money. If the options MM didn't prepared correctly in advance then this thing could go to the outer rims of our galaxy. There were so much shares shorted while the price came back down from its highs at the end of january but all those shares have to be returned on day and you can only return back those shares through calls because otherwise the price would go back up. As I said - the bags just got passed on. If dozen of million of shares are shorted throughout a whole month where the price goes down to 40$ then all those short positions still have to be closed. On paper those million big short positions made hundred millions of dollars but buying back dozens of million shares creates such a huge buyer overhang that someone has to pay the price for those millions of shares being shorted. From my understanding. If you buy a option then you are making a bet with someone else. Your counterpart is the option MMs in chicago. Through buying a call at 60 dollars you are betting that the price of the stock is higher as 60 dollars at the expiry date. If the price makes it up higher than 60$ you won and the option MM lost the bet and needs to pay for his losses. Through complex hedging they are reducing their losses and on a total sum they still make a lot of money because they act as a big institution and not as a individual that either looses or wins his bet. If another big institution steps up and outplays you then you still have to pay those huge losses as this is part of the casino. Sometimes there is a person winning at the roulette table making 1M $ at night but several other thousand people lost 10M $ at the other table but what if 20 guys win 1M $ in one night. You still have to pay them. The losses of the chicago option exchange is our gains and profit because in the end we retail guys are just a small fish that is snacking off the still decent leftover tendies that were available through 2 big sharks fighting against each other.

73,The squeeze is going to be way bigger than before.,2021-02-28 11:26:33,"
1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren‚Äôt even covering at the time.
2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that‚Äôs 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies)
3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to &lt;100
TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain‚Äôt finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65. 
In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten buttfucked to begin with.

75,BB - a long and factual look at Chen's hints and predictions during earnings calls,2021-02-28 19:01:04,"It's weekend, going outside is illegal, and I'm bored. I started my own DD into BB by looking up the most relevant recent information. If y'all don't feel like reading through the earnings calls transcripts, etc, I've put together a little summary. :) Figured I might as well post it here - if only for my personal records/safekeeping. (Automod deletes posts with links to certain sites, so you'll have to seek out the earnings transcripts yourselves, unfortunately.) Enjoy.

 

**Blackberry Q2 earnings transcript, 9/24/20.** 

 Most interesting (to me) takeaways: they're lobbying the US and Canadian governments to get more contracts; approaching other governments as well; trying to work with individual states, though pricing is an issue there. Chen recognizes that his sales people suck - that structure is being changed.

 

**December 2020:**

The AWS deal is already priced in: the 50% spike in December 2020. Bullish articles from analysts: what if it partners up with Tesla as well?

&amp;#x200B;

**Blackberry Q3 earnings transcript, 12/17/20:** 

Added a lot of federal government clients as well as the Bank of India and the Government of Rwanda. (How random is that?)

BB's AtHoc (secure communication) now owns the entire state of California.

Referring to the AWS partnership announcement: ""Combined, we‚Äôre able to provide a full end-to-end platform."" Hmmmm, this is probably just wishful thinking, but Amazon loves owning end-to-end stuff... I don't think they'll buy BB, but the potential is always there - just like they bought Goodreads, [Diapers.com](https://diapers.com/), etc.

BB's goal for integration in an actual car is 2023: until then, it'll remain in development. We won't see any subscription revenue this year or next, but there might be interesting announcements on more automakers partnering up with BB.

Annual Recurring Revenue is decreasing for the second quarter in a row. They expect it to go up when the covid mess gets better, meaning Q1-ish. Implication: it'll still suck in Q4.

Partnerships with Zoom, Verizon, and Microsoft.

Curious: papa Chen specified that his sales folks are using the SolarWinds hack (which didn't affect BB) as a big selling point. (Should we expect more sales revenue in Q4, then?..)

IVY beta version should be ready in September 2021. The developer version should be ready in mid-2021.

They're wooing 20 different electric vehicle manufacturers. Once they sign up, public announcements will follow if the manufacturers are fine with that.

Papa Chen name-drops Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS - and the upcoming CEO of Amazon later in 2021. Says ""He specifically spent quite a bit of time on how this particular -- this relationship. So you can see that they are very serious. This seriousness not only come from the cloud side, but it comes from the IoT side also at Amazon.""

The IVY revenue will be split with AWS.

 

**January 2021:**

The catalyst for the spike to $20 was the news about the Facebook settlement. However, none of the details of the settlement were disclosed. (Articles don't mention WSB as the catalyst. Heh.)

&amp;#x200B;

**My thoughts:**

1. The Facebook settlement news is interesting... That alone was enough to spike the price, which has since fallen by \~50%. Once the details are announced (on the 3/31 earnings call?), that alone might drive another price spike depending on how much money BB is getting.
2. Q4 earnings won't be announced until late March (3/31?). Sounds like they made a lot of new sales in Q4 by pointing out that the SolarWinds hack didn't affect them.

2a. More government contracts based on how badly the hack affected them?

3. Papa Chen might make new announcements about new electric vehicle partnerships at any time. I suspect if there will be big announcements, they will come before the earnings call, just like the AWS news dropped before the late-December call.

4. IVY developer version will drop in mid-2021. That might generate some headlines at long last.

5. This is the big one. Andy Jassy will take over Amazon from Jeff Bezos in Q3. Jassy is on record as a fan of Blackberry. That is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge. Read the Q3 earnings transcript: papa Chen and Jassy have a bromance. Unlike all the other developments, I don't think we'll have to wait for years and years until we start getting some interesting headlines from the AWS/BB team-up.

6. Papa Chen has not given any interviews at all in 2021. As far as I can tell, he hasn't made any public comments at all about the spike and the crash of his stock. Interesting. The guy is smart and he knows when to keep his mouth shut.

7. The Facebook settlement. The giant gorilla in the room. We still don't know how much money we're talking about here. That was one of the key things (aside from WSB haha) that spiked the stock in January. That's still a huge wildcard. The settlement's details will most likely be revealed either before the earnings call (mid-March?) or during the call. I don't think it's baked into the current stock price because right now BB is trading at pre-Facebook-announcement levels. Once the news is announced, it could be nothing, or it could drive another huge spike in price. And if that announcement is combined with some other good news... Well, I hope the guys that short BB will have enough to cover. :)

**tl;dr** \- BB has **a ton** of potential. I've been averaging down and holding because I like the stock. I'm not an advisor, this isn't for educational purposes, this is purely for entertainment.

79,GMEs inverse correlation with the market,2021-02-28 15:07:16,"So I have recently been doing a lot of research on recessions, and it‚Äôs hard to deny that it looks like we might be sitting on the brink of one. I recently watched a video by Jake Tran regarding the striking similarities between the Great Depression and today. Rock bottom interest rates on the rise, the average debt of individual Americans, the number of retail investors involved in the market (which also correlates with Germany‚Äôs hyper inflation in the WW1-2 era as suggested by Michael Burry), and the fact that wealth inequality is at an all time high since the days right before the Great Depression. It seems to me at least that we are looming over some treacherous waters.

How does that correlate with GME? 

Well, as we have seen, anytime there is an increase in GME there is a corresponding decrease in the rest of the market. Whether that be from hedge funds liquidating other stock to fight the GME war or the general fear of investors of the implications that come with GME. It has now happened both with the January and February rises and is not a coincidence. The markets fell by as much as 3% in a single day when GME was on the rise. 

Now, there has been some talk of a gamma squeeze still in the making. I‚Äôm not sure about it, but some Redditors are putting the date as March 19th, or at least in the weeks surrounding March 19th. How accurate is that? IDK you apes can go find the DD yourself, but it certainly seems a distinct possibility. If it does occur though, and it squeezes into the thousands or even tens of thousands, the resulting impact on the market will be tremendous. And given the delicate situation the market is in, could very well trigger a recession. 

Now what I find interesting is what happens in a recession, theoretically pinpointed on March 19th. Whenever a countries economy gets slapped around it affects the global economy, and a crash on this scale would certainly cause global issues. Historically, whenever there has been recessions, war always breaks out. Almost every time. Not necessarily in the US, but across the other nations as well. Considering our recent forays into the Middle East again, I don‚Äôt see us not getting dragged in. I also believe the tense situations over in that China, India, Pakistan area is a powder keg ready to let loose as well (remember all those Tik Toks with the Pakistani kids vowing to destroy India? They hate each other). 

So at this point, given where we stand, I almost think it‚Äôs more risky to not have a share of GME as a hedge against market collapse. And if it all goes south and GME goes to Pluto, I‚Äôm taking the tendies and investing in 3 things: 
- the digital security that cannot be named
- Precious metals
- and most importantly defense stocks

The defense stocks will be at rock bottom prices and I‚Äôll be ready to catch them with my tendies.

Anyway, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, I hardly know what I‚Äôm talking about in this discussion. I‚Äôm just and ape with a box of Crayolas. If you have a wrinkly brain feel free to tell me where I went wrong.

Probably not. So let‚Äôs explore some other reasons/catalysts:
1. GME Hearings probably got interest high enough again. Could have helped but honestly I only remember getting more mad than optimistic about our current standing. DFV‚Äôs opening statement definitely helped make our case and when he stated that the price was attractive at these levels it certainly got a lot of attention.
2. DFV‚Äôs double down. Now I among many of us was sick to my stomach from the blue balls I got watching it go from 400-40. So it was a great relief to me when DFV sent out his update and double down. Made me feel a little less of an r-tard averaging down as it dropped.
3. Short interest report. It was good to know but being delayed by 2 weeks doesn‚Äôt necessarily give us a rosy picture. Being that SI was calculated differently and we were at least still above 50% that was fine. But we never seem to have gotten a concrete answer on REAL SI, not the BS they sent us but on old calculations.
4. Power outage at Melvin/citadel/banks? This one I‚Äôm confused on, there were reports of a power outage in some banks around the time we started rallying again, I thought their short ladder bots could no longer keep the price down which is what opened the doors for us last time. Now this is where I‚Äôm confused. Did this actually happen, is this why it rose so dramatically? We were getting mixed messages at the time of what actually caused the spike."

85,"AMC ""BULL TRAP""",2021-02-28 14:56:10,"Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".

Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC &amp; GME to be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.

Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT &amp; DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?

Example:

On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".

I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.

""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""

The approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.

A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.

Do NOT Sell my friends."
86,Thread Carefully - Lots of Low Karma Shenanigans Afoot,2021-02-28 16:49:32,"Hi errybody, I‚Äôve been scrolling along and found several really well written posts or comments that vibed hard with either other stuff I‚Äôve seen on WSB or an interesting post that, because it was so well written, I paused to consider.

THEN....

I checked OPs profile and found that A METRIC FUCKTON of these are sub 30 day accounts with low karma. They‚Äôre even circle jerking each other or raising weak counterpoints and then conceding to OP. 

The old WSB saying goes, if you find a post that you might take action on, check the source. I can admit to chucking a few grand at some rando ticker bc it seemed like a good idea at the time- sometimes it paid off and sometimes it didn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm a little sad that those days are numbered for me. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing.

I see a lot of people accusing others of being bots or of foul play on relatively flimsy grounds like that.

u/crotchrocketpilot - Also, some WSB users delete our accounts every quarter/year for privacy. Why? Keep posting massive gains/losses, or an articulate analysis. You'll start getting spammed for various reasons. You'll see why."

97,Gamma squeeze has nothing to do with expiration,2021-02-28 12:33:19,"When a market maker sells you a call, they simultaneously buy the stock at the same time (well, they‚Äôre supposed to). If they don‚Äôt, they have huge risk exposure and would have to buy to hedge as price increases. The amount they buy depends on volatility and changes day to day. That‚Äôs called delta neutral hedging. For simplicity, i used a 1:1 hedge, but in reality delta dictates the amount of shares for the hedge. When enough calls are bought, this drives buying. This is the gamma squeeze. Most options are closed before expiration. Traders generally have no interest in exercising options and owning shares. What people fail to understand, is that the market maker already purchased the shares that would have to be sold to the option buyer if they did choose to exercise (unless they‚Äôre naked selling, which would be bad business for them and could bankrupt them). If they didn‚Äôt, and they sold you naked calls, they put themselves in a bad spot. They‚Äôd be on the hook to buy the shares if the names calls skyrocket. That purchase happened already. At exercise, you simply take the shares from the market maker and pay him the strike price for them. They aren‚Äôt bought on the open market, driving up the share price. That‚Äôs not how it works. Now, the reason why you see such volatility on Friday‚Äôs, is because traders are closing out their trades. When they sell the calls back to close the trade, the market maker then sells their shares back to the open market, driving the price down (it‚Äôs not always ‚Äúomg the shorts are doing a ladder attack!!‚Äù). Gamma squeeze happens at the time the calls are purchased because market maker is hedging to be delta neutral, not at expiration. Nobody is buying 40 million shares Monday morning because options expired ITM. That‚Äôs not how it works."

I am 21 years old and I have gambled upwards of over 1 million dollars since late 2019. Let me explain. I come from a family that is extremely educated. All my siblings are doctors and my father is an engineering professor. Many of my siblings left right around when I started high school. Despite the great success of my family, things have not always been perfect.

My father is an immigrant and is extremely cheap, callous, cheap, manipulative, and did I mention cheap? We lived extremely modestly in a wealthy area because they had good school districts. My family has often struggled to make friends of the whole family and my parents kept very weak connections with their family members. There have been many traumatizing moments for me including infidelity, abuse, and screaming that I have had to deal with since I was a child. In high school all of my siblings were moved out for their careers and education. Things started to really suck without them to say the least. My house has always been a complete dump. My parents and my sister have hoarding problems. Most of the house is unable to be walked through and has been for over 10 years. I have never invited any friends over because of how bad it looks. I think this is some psychological defense against outsiders, but I'm not sure. In my junior year of high school things began to go poorly and my parents stopped talking to each other for over a year and a half. I had to pass notes from the upstairs and downstairs rooms which they each lived so they could discuss things. It felt horrible. I was never one to quit so I continued on and had an amazing year outside of home. I showed up to school every day with a smile on my face and was loved by teachers and other people. I was one of the best students in the whole school. From then till senior year I won multiple awards, finished top % in basically every metric and was accepted to multiple institutions for tough undergrad programs and received many scholarships.

That brings us to today. My first year of college wasn't very exciting. I lived with a friend I've had since middle school and we explored the independent life. Sophomore year something happened, though. I saw an ad on instagram from an NFL player I loved promoting an app to make live sports bets. This wasn't traditional betting but rather a game that involved bets. I downloaded it and soon became hooked. I was great at it, they had a weekly contest I was winning hundreds and sometimes even $1000 on almost every week. I couldn't stop thinking about it. This was my own money. I had never had this money before. I bought shoes, a BRAND NEW iPhone which I still use today, and other needless things. After the app began to lose money and go broke I stopped doing it until junior year when I got into REAL sports betting. I deposited $500 of internship money into an account and turned it in $5000 in two weeks. I was hooked. My methodical strategies began to turn into madness. I would bet large sums on anything that was on. I had originally used this money to buy myself a car. My dad has a net worth of a few million but had refused to get me for years and made me ask my roommate to take me everywhere for years while making fun of him. I hated him for it. Once I lost my original $4500 profit I began to spiral. I used everything and maxed out my credit cards to bet. I had an obsession with betting the under ( this is basically what shorting is in the betting world). Soon I began to bet on things I couldn't watch: Russian table tennis, chinese basketball, turkish soccer, whatever was offered. I had to tell my mom what happened and she was in shock. She said this should not have happened and I will get you help. My dad sent me over 13k to pay off everything. I became so enraged I had cost them this I did it again a second time. Another 13k. I promised them it was over and after mulling they sent me the money again. Except I never stopped. I managed to stay alive continuing my habit by either needing money ""for new classes I'm signing up for"", coasting off of scholarship money I had to pay for classes, or getting lucky and paying off debt. Most of school I did the bare minimum and really only cared about my bets. Punched in live bets at the gym. In class. At Home. During Spring break. If I could I would bet. In January I had managed to pay off a 2k deficit and had 6k of money, in my hands, with no debt. Today I owe 11k. For just one second I wondered if I was even worth being alive. At this point my parents have basically disowned me unless I turn over my entire life to them. They don't know I never stopped.

This is where Gamestop comes in. I decided I would never gamble sports again and put my last 2k of profit into a brokerage. In late January I used my last 2k to buy 22 shares of gamestop at $88. I was lost in the movement staying up almost every night for premarket and checking my phone over 12 hours a day. I remember waking up to seeing 10k in my account from my shares. I didn't sell. Eventually I paper handed after robinhood stopped allowing buy of GME. With my small profit I returned to the market and built my account back up. Lost most of it and last week I bought 23 GME shares this time @ 116. My whole portfolio. Truly I don't care what happens anymore. I just like the stock. I'm not scared of anything and if I lose it all then I'll just make sure I remember how it felt to have nothing when I make it in this world one day because I know I will.

Nobody knows this, my roommate has lived with me for 4 years and is one of my best friends and actually thinks I'm doing well financially because of my early success. Today I watched the movie flight and I just felt like I had to get this off my chest somehow after watching the final few scenes.

I don't plan on speaking to my parents much again, they probably won't be at my graduation, and I wake up every day hating the decisions me and them have both made in our life. Right now GME is all I have. I'm here to shout to the rooftops why I'm here and where I'm from, this can happen to anybody. I don't want sympathy I just want to go to the moon. Apes strong.

This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. a lot. 23 @ 116"

Understand the data, charts reveal patterns and this looks like it will be a monthly cycle, until a crash, or more stocks become available(sold or issued by GME).

I had FOMO in January and tried to jump in on the Friday, we know what happened then. I didn't do research. I had cash and wanted get a win, but also thought I was helping to stick it to WS. Of course, got burned, but instead of selling, decided to hold, average down and try to get to a point I can get out with something positive(even if it isn't cash).

The only thing going for me is time, I don't need the cash (now), but will hope I can recoup the loses eventually. Right now it is a constant reminder every time I load Fidelity. It pisses me off every day to see the red(net loss), so wanted to come up with a way to help others.

I am a practical/visual learner, anyone know a good paper trading app that I can simulate the market history to see how a decision would have worked? Thinkorswim doesn't work for me; I need to experiment on a trade and see how that would happen with simulated trends. ""Realtime is too slow for this stuff to really understand it"" edit: the term i was looking for ""Backtesting""

With that said, this is what I am understanding from the charts. A pattern looks to be forming. Time will tell and will see what happens at the end of March. This is how I see things and watch the slope of the line:

1. Volume: larger bars then the previous trend(see below just before rise), if lots of green, those are large buys
2. OBV: The values are high, then a spike(sharp rise). If the level sustains, shit is about to happen. note each spike and how it lines up with other data
3. RSI: is running high at these spikes. when it spikes over 70 that is another signal, but if this crosses 30 downward watch out.
4. MACD: trend line is flat and the spread between signal line start to spread drastically.

Edit: per one of the comments below, will make my statement on this in this post. This will only help trying to find a good point to jump into a stock(not GME specific). For example, if you look at RKT today, with this new information would you buy tomorrow?

Edit: added the line about backtesting

**Prelude-** This is the company that owns that Huge Building in Singapore shaped like a cruise ship in the sky and charged me $40 for a bottle of water with dinner.

\#1 **MGM was upgraded but research houses reduced Las Vegas Sands due to their Asia exposure?**

I am sorry, what? Have you seen Asia? They are literally throwing festivals in China, Japan, Singapore and Australia etc. If you ever been to Asian countries you will find that they love to Drink, Smoke and Gamble. I feel if you are going into Casino/gambling company you NEED Asian Exposure. I could continue for many points on Asian casino‚Äôs but I‚Äôd lose concentration.

\#2- **Dr Michael Burry,** He is at it again, its no lie, I love him. He only has 2% of his portfolio invested in LVS but hey, he only had 4.3% in GME.

\#3 **The House Always wins**. People are going to come back, business will boom again and people are going to bet harder than they have before and the house always wins.

\#4 Hotels, Dining, Entertainment, Conventions and Exhibitions will all be sort after activities.

*Sands have a finger in each of these pies.*

\#5 **Online Casinos**\- there‚Äôs been rumors about them moving into deals with online casinos- which could future proof any thing along the lines of this pandemic again as well as increasing their reach to a digital level. In fact they have targeted 888 Holdings.

\#6 **Investing in themselves** They aren‚Äôt afraid to spend money- they're about to invest another $10b into Macau. Quote from earnings call-

¬∑ *‚ÄúWhen the Macanese government makes its decision I think we will continue upon a rather solid capital investment which I know is how* [*Sheldon*](https://www.asgam.com/index.php/2021/01/12/sheldon-adelson-supercharged-by-asia/) *felt, to grab that opportunity with both hands.‚Äù*

¬∑ *‚ÄúWhen all this goes away, I bet one thing that will happen is the Macau government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macau and we want to be there and be ready.‚Äù*

¬∑ *Noting that LVS is already in the midst of a US$3.3 billion expansion of its Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore, Goldstein observed, ‚ÄúThese are not small investments, they are in the billions of dollars, so we have to be prepared for outside investments in our best markets, which are Macau and Singapore for crazy growth.‚Äù*

125,A note on the possible ways shorts could worm their way out of this and one BIG problem we could face.,2021-02-28 16:00:10,"To start off with, I have to say that this post is not intended to spread FUD or to discourage people. This is a post to help us ‚Äúplan for the worst and hope for the best‚Äù. It is to open a discussion with people more knowledgeable than myself who can help clear up some of these issues.

&amp;#x200B;

While commenting on another post I started to realise some of the ways the hedge funds could try and climb out of this hole they have dug, or at least screw us over in the process of a squeeze. I have not seen these points being discussed nor do I know of any solid reasons why they couldn‚Äôt happen.

There is evidence that the shorts have already used illegal actions to supress the price and delay a full squeeze on GameStop. I cannot comment on whether they DEFINITELY committed any crimes, but in the interest of risk management I think we all need to presume they have done, and will do again.

You see, when an organisation has as much money as some of these hedge funds, they have power as well. Real power. Most people would presume the age of the 1% getting away with everything has passed, but it has just become more subtle. As the world saw in 2008, these people can and do get away with their crimes, even if it destroys entire economies.

Anyway, to get to the point, I have been thinking about multiple ways the shorts can and possibly will try and save themselves, or at least stop us from seeing the full potential of the squeeze.

\[Note: Some of these points are aimed directly at brokerages, but with the possibility that hedge funds may have pulled strings to manipulate the brokers in mind. i.e., Actions of brokerages that directly benefit the short sellers.\]

\[Note 2: This whole post is to be taken as a question of sorts. I am not stating facts, merely presenting problems. If anyone actually knows the definitive answer or likelihood to any of these problems then please comment.\]

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brokerages block the ‚Äòsell‚Äô option.**

Considering our problem last time was them blocking buys, this might not immediately seem like such a bad thing, because that would mean the price would only go up, right?

Stopping further short selling would benefit us as the price couldn‚Äôt be supressed as much, but stopping us from selling would just mean the price would go up, and we‚Äôd be left watching as we are unable to ever sell. As much as I am willing to hold forever if I have to, we are all hoping for it to reach such a price where we would sell eventually.

But wouldn‚Äôt this be illegal? Would it? I thought that blocking buys would be illegal but apparently not. If they can block the buys they can probably block the sells as well ‚Äì they bury a lot of manipulative and controlling stuff in their terms and conditions. If anyone with a greater understanding of the law knows about the legality of restricting selling could let us know then that would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brokerages allow people to sell at extreme profits, but refuse to pay the astronomical prices.**

This is one that definitely **should** be illegal, and something even the most untouchable couldn‚Äôt get away with. With that said, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable resting everything on a ‚Äòshould‚Äô. Whether you think it at all possible or not, imagine if the massive target of $30million per share actually happens. Can you really see all these brokerages just coughing up straight away without any fuss?

Or, is it at all possible that they could yet again hide behind legal loopholes and fine print to refrain from paying us those amounts? ‚ÄúThere is a maximum amount you can have in your account at one time‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is over the maximum amount of money we can handle in a transaction‚Äù, ‚ÄúDue to the extreme volatility of this stock, sell order could not be processed, the number you are seeing on screen is incorrect and will be removed from your account. Do not try to withdraw any of this money.‚Äù The list goes on.

I especially want to make it clear here that I am asking if any of this is possible. I am a bit of an idiot but I think a discussion is worth having on these matters, because as far as I am concerned, everything is on the table and nothing is too farfetched.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brokerages artificially fake outages and failures, blocking people from using their services and pretending they were just overwhelmed with the extreme, sudden increase in volume of users again.**

How do we know they haven‚Äôt already done this? They can stop people from trading freely while blaming technology and even the large amount of people using their service.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Hedge funds digitally attacking brokerages to cut off a large chunk of retail investors and lock them out of the squeeze.**

Is it possible the hedge funds could pay others to attack the brokerages digitally, whether through something like a DDoS attack or other methods? I imagine they would especially target the large no-commission brokers like Robinhood and T212.

It also seems to me like it would be a difficult crime to trace back to the hedge funds, and I actually see very little reason why hedge funds wouldn‚Äôt be able to do this. With the amount of money the hedgies are set to lose, they are going to be desperate and willing to resort to desperate measures. If this did happen and we were unable to sell then would we be entitled to compensation?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# THE BIG ONE.

**\[Update:** I have had numerous people commenting with good explanations of the following point. I am now considering 'THE BIG ONE' not so big anymore, and thank you all for your input.\]

If the main shorts responsible for all of this go bankrupt before they are able to buy back every single share they‚Äôd have to, what would happen then?

If the numbers people are estimating are even close to the true possible number then I would say it‚Äôs very likely they‚Äôd go bankrupt very quickly. It is my understanding that most debts of sorts are written off when a company or organisation files for bankruptcy, which is the main reason some people force their own companies into bankruptcy only the re-launch with a different name and no debt.

If we really do destroy the hedge funds that are behind the majority of the short positions, then do we destroy ourselves in the process? I can‚Äôt see them being forces to pay up billions upon billions in debt if they are bankrupt, because they would never reasonably obtain that money. In that case, who is going to pay?

My best guess is that in one the worst case scenarios the price skyrockets as they cover as much as they can and then it just stops when they run out of money. No one else is going to voluntarily buy those shares at those prices so wouldn‚Äôt we end up with GME stalling at an insane price but with no one able to sell and no one able to buy, meaning the share price would just‚Ä¶ stop?

If that did happen then I can‚Äôt see the SEC or the US Government (simply because it‚Äôs a US stock) doing nothing as for the first time a stock get‚Äôs infinitely stuck. Therefore, would they then artificially lower the price to get people buying again? This would mean none of us could actually sell at the price it reaches.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you even made it this far you are all probably pissed off at me for saying it over and over, but I am NOT claiming any of this will happen. The last thing I want to do is unintentionally spread FUD. I‚Äôm presuming some will call me a shill anyway for even bringing these points up but I need to clarify that I am invested in GME and I am confident that it will squeeze at some point. I am 100% in this cause, and I don‚Äôt believe this is any reason for people to worry or be demotivated.

With that said, I am not so na√Øve as to presume this will all go perfectly for us with no obstacles ‚Äì just look at last time when they stopped us from buying and killed the upwards momentum. We need to be as best prepared as we can, and ideally we need a legal ‚Äòmutually assured destruction‚Äô to dissuade anything I have mentioned here.

What I am asking for is for people to PLEASE prove me wrong. If any of you have a greater knowledge of the law or the inner workings of things then please comment and let us all know.

Beyond Meat and PepsiCo have announced the formation of a joint venture called The Planet Partnership to develop snacks and beverages made from plant-based protein. This is Beyond‚Äôs first expansion outside of plant-based meats, indicating that its total addressable market is likely larger than investors initially envisioned. The shares are responding accordingly, surging 20% on the news. If the venture is limited to the types of products already in Pepsi‚Äôs lineup, the Beyond Meat stock movement is likely an overreaction, as plant-based Frappuccino, Muscle Milk, and Matador jerky would likely not generate the $300 million in annual revenue needed to justify it. If the venture expands to other dairy and meat-based products outside of Pepsi‚Äôs current portfolio, the market opportunity will be larger, but so will execution risks as the firms move further away from their traditional areas of expertise. Additionally, while Pepsi has had several successful partnerships, not all its deals have panned out well.  The partnership with Pepsi is a wise approach to leveraging Beyond‚Äôs plant-based protein expertise and Pepsi‚Äôs marketing and distribution muscle in order to meet consumers‚Äô growing appetite for sustainable products. 





üöÄüöÄ  

Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat, or PBM, industry, offering the first burger to look and taste like meat, although it was soon followed by Impossible Foods and many others. Given the rapidly changing marketplace, it is too early to tell if Beyond‚Äôs first-mover advantage will result in a sustained market leadership position. A primary growth driver to be the 20% of consumers willing to adjust their habits to benefit the environment, as Beyond‚Äôs products emit 90% less greenhouse gases, require 93% less land, 99% less water, and 46% less energy to produce than their meat equivalents. PBMs will be very successful abroad, in China and India in particular, the world‚Äôs two most populated countries, each with 1.4 billion people. The products offer a great solution for China, which does not have enough arable land to feed its huge population, and a great fit for India‚Äôs large vegetarian population. Both countries are highly amenable to the products, with surveys showing 96% of Chinese and 94% of India‚Äôs population are likely to try the products, compared with 75% of U.S. consumers. The global PBM market will grow from $12 billion in 2019 to $74 billion by 2029 (a 19% CAGR), as PBMs grow from 2.5% of the ground meat market to 12%. Models show Beyond‚Äôs market share increasing from 2.5% in 2019 to nearly 9% in 2029, as PBMs gain a larger share of the overall meat category, and as Beyond‚Äôs brand continues to win with consumers, given its strong performance in taste tests and ongoing R&amp;D investments.





üöÄüöÄüöÄ 

 There has been substantial consumer interest in Beyond Burger, which could signal modest initial brand strength, although the sustainability is far from a guarantee. The brand has been successfully used to drive traffic into restaurants. In the summer of 2018, A&amp;W Canada, the country's second largest burger chain, ran an advertising campaign promoting the Beyond Burger, and the campaign drove a material increase in guest counts, leading to record same-store sales growth in the quarters following the launch, and the restaurant reported that it was the fastest new-product launch in the history of the chain. When Beyond Burger launched at TGI Fridays, it was also the fastest new product launch in the chain's history. Consumers flocked to KFC in Atlanta for a limited time test of Beyond Chicken, causing the store to sell out of the product in under five hours. That day the restaurant sold as many Beyond Chicken boneless wings and nuggets as it would normally sell of its popcorn chicken in a week. In April 2020, McDonald‚Äôs CEO stated the firm will launch a plant-based burger, but he was unsure of the timing. In November, the chain indicated the burger will likely not carry the Beyond brand, but we think Beyond will be a primary supplier, as Beyond helped to develop the product and few firms have enough capacity. The deal could add about $180 million in annual sales, increasing our valuation by 14% to $166.




üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
  
Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat (PBM) industry, launching the Beyond Burger, the first vegetarian burger designed to look and taste like meat, during the second quarter of 2016, shortly followed by privately held Impossible Foods' Impossible Burger, launched July 2016. While Beyond Meat is not the first PBM to hit the market, as wide-moat Kellogg's MorningStar Farms brand has been on the market since 1975, Beyond Burger revolutionized the category by targeting omnivores (95% of U.S. consumers) and first merchandised the products in the meat case in 2016. Also, unlike its predecessors, Beyond Meat seeks to make its products indistinguishable from their animal-protein equivalents in terms of appearance, taste, texture, and cookability. Legacy players (Kellogg's MorningStar Farms, Conagra's Gardein, Kraft-Heinz's Boca Burger) have sought to produce a vegetable- based product that tastes good, but does not mimic meat, which would not appeal to the products' largely vegetarian customer base. However, seeing the strong demand for meat-like PBMs from omnivores, several similar meat-like products, have launched over the past year. It took Beyond Meat seven years and Impossible Foods five years to develop a PBM that tastes, looks, and even bleeds like real meat. As the industry is in its infancy, and most competitive products are in the process of launching, it is too early to know if Beyond's first-mover advantage will prove prohibitive to overcome (similar to wide-moats Coke and Pepsi), or if the new products (most from well-resourced firms) will be able to quickly develop products that resonate with consumers. .




TLDR

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Plant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category. Beyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand‚Äôs strong performance in taste tests. Beyond Meat will likely be a major PBM supplier for McDonald's, as it worked with the chain to develop its plant-based burger, and few competitors have enough capacity to supply the large restaurant. A deal could add $180 million in annual sales.




TLDR;tldr;

144,Snack on the Sneakiest Short Squeeze of all time with UTZüöÄüöÄüöÄ,2021-03-01 02:28:46,"I know what you‚Äôre thinking. A potato chip company, you gotta be kidding me. I also know you‚Äôre thinking another fucking short squeeze, but hear me out‚Ä¶ There is something VERY strange going on with this stock and I‚Äôm here to shed some light on it. 

Well listen here smooth brain because I‚Äôm not kidding and I would never fucking touch a company that moves as slowly as this stock unless I thought I could make a shitload of money. 

There is the sneakiest short squeeze of all time going on here and I‚Äôm ready to exploit it and apparently somebody else is too. 

So here it is, laid out as simply as I can put for you dumbasses. Somebody (insider, smart-money, whoever) who knows something we don‚Äôt know is betting BIG that this stock is hitting 30$ by the March 19th expiration. They have **OVER 600,000$ riding on this call that sits 5$ out of the money**\- it's the absolute definition of unusual options activity and when coupled with the fact the stock rarely has any options volume and it has ZERO upcoming public events something is about to happen and we just don‚Äôt know it yet. 

[Unusual Option Activity on 2\/17 for March 30c](https://preview.redd.it/b95j2t6bubk61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35b88b935343a21aac7fb5f6d57e75ac2dffbc24)

My thoughts are pretty simple- this stock is on its way up to the fucking moon and with contracts this cheap now after a market slump the opportunity to **10X or 15X** your invest is there. Somebody knows something is going on and with UTZ ‚Äòs recent history of buying up other brands On the Border Tortilla Chips (Second leading tortilla chip brand) and Vitner‚Äôs (A Chicago based salty snack manufacturer) a merger is most likely on the horizon and undoubtedly sending this stock over 30$. This merger or announcement would send the shorts running and in an attempt to cover they‚Äôd find themselves buying back the stock at insane amounts. 

If you made it this far I bet you already are considering it so why waste your time anymore.

**TLDR: Buy March 19th 30C wait for a big random catalyst event and enjoy.**

For a deeper analysis of what I think will happen here it is:

**The most likely scenario: UTZ 32$+ Per Share 500% Return**

Unlike most of the other companies looked at on this forum UTZ actually makes money. It IPO‚Äôd via a SPAC merger and has been on a tear up over 150% since then. However, unlike your typical SPAC this company makes good money and has a good balance sheet with plenty of cash on hand. They‚Äôve been using this cash to buy other brands like crazy in hopes of expanding their market out of the mostly the northeast and midwest to the rest of the country. Their CEO Dylan Lissette has made it known on CNBC that he wants to grow the company and has aggressive plans to do so. This would lend that big better to most likely be anticipating a massive merger in the following weeks which would allow them to cash in their huge position at a massive gain. 

**The rare but plausible scenario: UTZ Short Squeeze 50$+ Per Share 5000% Return**

This will sound a little crazy but at this point I know you guys will believe anything if I put enough rockets and tell you I‚Äôll make you rich- which I am. So listen, **THIS WILL MAKE YOU RICH IF IT HAPPENS AND IT'S WORTH BETTING ON**. There is the possibility for a quick short squeeze and a subsequent gamma squeeze the likes of which would send this **WELL** stock beyond 50$. 

Here is some quick math for you:

15.23% of the stock is held by insiders.

71.26% of the stock is held by institutions. 

There are 2.95 MILLION shares SHORTED.

What this all means is that with the current amount of stock held by insiders and institutions there is only 8 millions shares free float. This becomes a big problem for the shorts very quickly if the stock price shoots up on a merger, not only because they are forced to buy back their shares BUT market makers are now involved due to the larger options orders THAT if soon become in the money will FORCE them to buy shares of the underlying stock to remain delta neutral.

As you know market makers try their best to remain delta neutral when making deals. When this big buyer came in and forced market makers to open 5,000 contracts with a delta of 0.25 they were forced to buy 25% of the shares they owed in those 5,000 contracts- to remain delta neutral as I said. 

5,000 contracts = 500,000 outstanding shares (if the contracts are in the money) 

In order to remain delta neutral they would have to purchase 125,000 shares. Which they did as seen here: When the big buy orders hit the tape at 10:11 AM we see a huge spike as market makers buy in as they need to have 125,000 shares purchased to remain delta neutral. 

[MM Big Purchase at 10:11 on 2\/17](https://preview.redd.it/gso9r544vbk61.jpg?width=1177&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cff362d577d8fe165cfc3728b8bac6b5e7cef50)

As open interest increases and we now see it nearing closer to 7,000 contracts, as the stock moves closer to 30$ more market makers will be forced to buy in and thus leave less room for the shorts to cover their asses. If buying increases and stock is held then these shorts could be on the hook for a lot of money.

""The Company is not currently in the production stage and generally utilizes suppliers for outside development and engineering support.""

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/nikola-corporation-nkla-q4-2020-earnings-call-tran/

In fact, 10k states it clearly:

""We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of our trucks, which is not expected to begin at least until 2022 for our BEV truck and the second half of 2023 for our FCEV truck, and may occur later. Even if we are able to successfully develop and sell or lease our trucks, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful""

And here:

""We expect to derive revenue from our BEV trucks in late 2021 and FCEV trucks in the second half 2023. Prior to commercialization, we must complete modification or construction of required manufacturing facilities, purchase and integrate related equipment and software, and achieve several research and development milestones. As a result, we will require substantial additional capital to develop our products and services and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from product sales and hydrogen FCEV leases, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of existing cash on hand, public offerings, private placements, debt financings, collaborations, and licensing arrangements.""

And here:

‚ÄúWe expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be significantly high in future periods as we:

‚Ä¢design, develop and manufacture our trucks;

‚Ä¢construct and equip our manufacturing plant to produce our trucks in Arizona;

‚Ä¢modify and equip the Iveco manufacturing plant in Germany to produce our trucks in Europe;

‚Ä¢build up inventories of parts and components for our trucks;

manufacture an available inventory of our trucks;

‚Ä¢develop and deploy our hydrogen fueling stations;

‚Ä¢expand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities;

‚Ä¢increase our sales and marketing activities and develop our distribution infrastructure; and

‚Ä¢increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.

Because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenue with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significant. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenue, which would further increase our losses.""

Then there's is the pesky issue of multiple lawsuits and investigations hanging over Nikola:

‚ÄúOn September 10, 2020, Hindenburg Research LLC reported on certain aspects of the Company‚Äôs business and operations. The Company and its board of directors retained Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP to conduct an internal review in connection with the Hindenburg article (the ‚ÄúInternal Review‚Äù), and Kirkland &amp; Ellis promptly contacted the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to make it aware of the commencement of the Internal Review. The Company subsequently learned that the staff of the Division of Enforcement had previously opened an investigation. On September 14, 2020, the Company and¬†five¬†of its officers and employees, including Mark Russell, our Chief Executive Officer, received subpoenas from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement as a part of a fact-finding inquiry related to aspects of the Company‚Äôs business as well as certain matters described in the Hindenburg article. The Staff of the Division of Enforcement issued additional subpoenas to another¬†three¬†of the Company‚Äôs officers and employees, including Kim Brady, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, on September 21, 2020 and to the Company‚Äôs current and former directors on September 30, 2020.

The Company and Mr. Milton also received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of New York (the ‚ÄúSDNY‚Äù) on September 19, 2020.
(...)
The Company also received a grand jury subpoena from the N.Y. County District Attorney‚Äôs Office on September 21, 2020. On October 16, 2020, the N.Y. County District Attorney‚Äôs Office agreed to defer its investigation; it has not withdrawn its subpoena issued to the Company, but has informed the Company that no further productions to it are necessary at this time.
(...)
The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations, nor can it predict whether any other governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations. The outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include a wide variety of outcomes, including the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former employees, officers and/or directors, the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and/or sanctions, modifications to business practices and compliance programs and/or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions. 
(...)
Further, to the extent that these investigations and any resulting third-party claims yield adverse results over time, such results could jeopardize the Company's operations and exhaust its cash reserves, and could cause stockholders to lose their entire investment.

Shareholder Securities Litigation

Beginning on September 15, 2020,¬†six¬†putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù), and, in one case, violations of the Unfair Competition Law under California law (the ‚ÄúShareholder Securities Litigation‚Äù). The complaints generally allege that the Company and certain of its officers and directors made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Company's business plan and prospects.
(...) 
Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount in damages, attorneys‚Äô fees, and other relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.

Derivative Litigation

Beginning on September 23, 2020,¬†two¬†purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Byun v. Milton, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-01277-UNA;¬†Salguocar v. Girsky et. al.,¬†Case No. 1:20-cv-01404-UNA), purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company's current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and gross mismanagement. The¬†Byun¬†action also brings claims for unjust enrichment and abuse of control, while the¬†Salguocar¬†action brings a claim for waste of corporate assets.
(...)
On December 18, 2020, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona,¬†Huhn v. Milton et al.,¬†Case No. 2:20-cv-02437-DWL, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company‚Äôs current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, unjust enrichment, and against defendant Jeff Ubben, a member of the Company‚Äôs board of directors, insider selling and misappropriation of information.
(...)
The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and fees associated with bringing the actions, and reform of the Company's corporate governance, risk management and operating practices. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the foregoing complaints. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.""

The problem with all these investigations and lawsuits is that Nikola Motor has admitted that they have merit:

‚ÄúThe Hindenburg article alleged that Mr. Milton or the Company made a number of statements, which it asserted were inaccurate, including but not limited to the following:

1.in July 2016, the Company stated that it owned rights to natural gas wells, and in August 2016 that the wells were used as a backup to solar hydrogen production;

2.in August 2016, Milton and the Company stated that the Company had engineered a zero emissions truck;

3.in December 2016, Milton stated that the Nikola One was a fully functioning vehicle;

4.that an October 2017 video released by the Company gave the impression the Nikola One was driven;

5.in April 2019, Milton stated that solar panels on the roof of the Company‚Äôs headquarters produce approximately¬†18¬†megawatts of energy per day;

6.in December 2019 and July 2020, Milton stated that the Company ‚Äúcan produce‚Äù over¬†1,000¬†kg of hydrogen at the Company‚Äôs demo stations and that the Company was ‚Äúdown below‚Äù $3/kg at that time;

7.in July 2020, Milton stated that ‚Äúall major components are done in house‚Äù; he made similar statements in June 2020;

8.in July 2020, Milton stated that the inverter software was the most advanced in the world and that other OEMs had asked to use it; and

9.in July 2020, Milton stated that¬†five¬†trucks were ‚Äúcoming off the assembly line‚Äù in Ulm, Germany.

The statements listed above were inaccurate in whole or in part, when made.""

\*\*$SENS\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Current Share price (2/28): $ 3.46

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*THESIS:\*\*

Based on my DD I believe that SENS will be seen as substantially undervalued at its current market value in the near/mid future. With their 180-day sensor having been brought to market last quarter in Europe we should get impressive numbers out of them at earnings. This will establish to investors what the potential market for these kinds of devices will be. Due to the Diabetes epidemic in the United States the market for these sensors will be substantially higher than overseas. Once investors have the data from overseas sales they will extrapolate the potential earnings in the US and the fair value of the stock will rise dramatically. Over the next 2 years this type of technology will become industry standard for reading glucose levels as it saves users from constant finger pricks and will be able to supply doctors with substantially more data into a patient‚Äôs glucose levels. As the biopharma industry realizes this data can be used to analyze blood sugar levels in diabetics on a scale never seen before there will be a push from the biopharma industry to make these industry standard in order to accelerate the discoveries of new Diabetes treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*ANALYSIS: ITM CALL BREAKDOWN\*\*

7/26 $1C

Current Premium = $2.55.

Delta = .9513 Gama =.0263 Theta = -.0014 Vega = .0021

&amp;#x200B;

This premium is essentially the difference in cost of the current share price and the cost to exercise. Delta is high, Gama is low. This means for every $1 SENS increases the option will increase in value by $.95. Because Gama is low there is little room for the delta to grow past its current place. As the stock price grows deeper ITM Delta will increase slightly. If the stock price dips and becomes closer to the strike price Delta will decrease by the rate of Gama. Theta on this call is very low, it will take a long time before Theta rises to the point where Theta decay will become substantial. Vega is low, meaning implied volatility is considered low on this option. If the price of the stock were to begin to rise quickly Vega will rise as implied volatility increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Takeaways from this information

&amp;#x200B;

1. Delta and Gama are already priced into the Call, any growth you would see beyond a 1:1 ratio to the stock price will not come from the stock growing at its      current rate.
2. This is a safe call to hold for long term as the Theta is low.
3. Vega is not priced into the call. If the stock price were to begin to grow at a rate faster than it has historically Vega will begin to increase, accelerating the growth of the call.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the potential benefits of buying this Call?

\-  If you believe the stock has room to continue growing at its current rate this call could be used to take a position in the stock at a discounted price. Instead of purchasing 100 shares for $346 you could buy this equivalent call for $255. If the stock price were to rise from here to $4.46 you would net a similar profit from purchasing the 100 shares or the call but would have needed less starting capital to do so.

\- If you believe that a catalyst is going to be coming sometime between now and EXPY this call would begin to grow in value beyond the rate of the stock price as Vega increases. This is because the higher Vega is not priced into the call at its current premium.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the potential downsides of buying this call?

\- As the delta is already high any decrease in the share value will see a 1:1 ratio in the decrease in the Call‚Äôs premium. If the share price were to drop to $2.46 from its current price the Delta will decrease the Call‚Äôs premium to $1.55. This would be a 40% decrease in the calls value. This is a 10% larger loss of your starting capital than if you simply took the $255 you used for the premium of the call and used it to purchase it‚Äôs equivalent in shares.

\- Holding the call rather than shelling out the additional capital to purchase the shares means that you cannot hedge your position throughout its lifespan. If you are holding this call long term because you believe the stock is going to continue to grow at its current rate there will be unrealized gains that you could have made by selling Covered Calls along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Ways to utilize this Call to make a profit:

\- Because this Call has a low Theta it is safe to hold for a while as a stand in for 100 shares. This Call can be used to make gains short-term by purchasing now and selling when the stock hits your target price. By doing so you will earn the profits of 100 shares while having used less starting capital to do so. If Vega increases beyond what it is now than the change in volatility will help to supplement the profits that would have been earned on those same shares.

I would think this Call has more value potential than 100 shares if:

\- I believed that there is going to be a catalyst to disrupt its current rate of growth.

&amp;#x200B;

A Possible Catalyst for $SENS Could Be:

\-  Earnings could show Impressive sales numbers from their European business, showing proof that there is demand and interest for their product. 

\- Their sensor being granted FDA approval within the time frame of the call. 

Either of these catalysts could trigger an increase in implied volatility (raising Vega).

&amp;#x200B;

I run the risk of:

\-The stock falling on earnings below a threshold that other positive news could raise it above its current market value. This would result in a loss to my starting capital greater than if I purchased shares with the cost of the premium.

&amp;#x200B;

Possible Scenarios:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Earnings creates increased interest in the      stock. The price rises faster than it has been historically. Sell offs      occur as investors reach their exit price. The price begins to rise again      as other investors FOMO into the stock on the dip. As other catalysts form      this pattern (large amounts of new investors buying in as long-term      holders sell off) continues over a long enough period of time causing the      implied volatility of the stock to increase. The share price rises over      time on the waves.

\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price.

\- The increased Vega from the higher implied volatility also raises the cost of the premium.

\- The call becomes substantially more profitable than shares.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Earnings has very little impact on interest of SENS. The share price grows gradually as its fair value increases.

\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price.

\-Vega remains unchanged

\- The calls profitability grows at a rate similar to that of the underlying shares.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Earnings causes a massive shift in interest away from $SENS and the stock price sees a sharp drop followed by a continued bleed until it hits a price where it is viewed as undervalued. 

\- The high delta makes the call depreciate quickly

\- Vega will remain relatively unchanged.

\- The Call loses value quickly.

For this Call I think the most likely scenario is somewhere between 1 and 2. Whether it be earnings or FDA approval I think there will be continued rise in interest in SENS. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Position (Entering Monday Morning):

200 Shares (Cost = $692) - I am going to hold these shares long term as SENS becomes more profitable. In the interim I am going to sell monthly covered calls on these 100% over whatever their current market value is to generate a small profit through premiums.

Example: The current price is $3.46 as of 2/28/21. I will sell 2 $7C 4/16 for a combined premium of $78. 

\-----------

10 X $1C 7/16 (Premium $2.50, Total Cost = $2550) - These will be the base of my position. Purchasing these over shares at current market value saves me $910 in capital. As I believe that SENS will come to be seen as undervalued at its current market price over the next 4 months I should see a profit at minimum equivalent to the shares they represent with the added upside of any increases due to an increase in Vega down the line.

\----------------

5 X $10C 1/20/2023 (Premium = $2.25, Total Cost = $1115) - These Calls are considerably attractive to me for two reasons. First ‚Äì I believe that $12 (The Break-Even Price) by the end of 2022 will be under market value for SENS. Second ‚Äì The Greeks present an opportunity to turn a profit short term should my thesis be altered. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Greeks

Delta = .7902, Gama = .0340, Theta = -.0018, Vega = .0136

&amp;#x200B;

For obvious reasons any Call planning to be held long term must have a very low Theta. Vega is priced higher than the 7/16 Calls I broke down, but I believe any drop in premium that could be caused by a decrease in Vega will be substantially offset by the Delta and Gama. A .7902 Delta for a Call that is over 100% OTM is substantial. Gama is high enough that the Delta will increase at a decent rate as the stock grows in price.

‚óè It is worth noting that a Delta this high on an OTM call means that the calls have plenty of room to drop if the share price falls below its current market price, increasing the risk of higher losses on this play.

&amp;#x200B;

Exit Strategy:

\- Continue to hold shares and sell monthly covered calls 100% above market value until the rest of the play resolves. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- If the value of my 7/16 Calls at any point becomes 200% higher than the value of the underlying shares I will trim 50% of this position. The other 50% will be held until July to be either sold or to be exercised. If these calls maintain a value similar the underlying shares I will hold until July and exercise at EXPY and begin to sell monthly covered calls 50% above market value until the rest of the play resolves or until assigned.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I will hold the 1/20/23 Calls throughout all of 2021. If in 2022 profit levels reach +2000% sell 1. Sell another every time profit rises another 2000%. If profit never reaches target by June of 2022 adjust numbers to +1000%. If by October of 2022 profit targets have not been reached and share price is below $12 close position. If Share price remains above $12 hold until EOY and exercise Calls.

&amp;#x200B;

After the Play

\- Continue to sell monthly covered calls of any accumulated shares at 20% above market value until assigned or until information comes up that would compel me to close out my position."

TL;DR for Pt 1 is below:

1) NVAX has the best in class vaccine and has the technological advantage of being able to easily become multivalent. This means with 1 vaccine you can get immunity for multiple variants and even the Flu as well. Other companies, particularly MRNA companies, need to give you a separate vaccine for each dose. Also it can be stored at 4C long term (unlike MRNA which needs -20C to -70C long term) and it has less side effects and has the highest reported efficacy to date (95.6%).

2) NVAX is fundamentally undervalued. Sitting at a market cap of $15Bn it is cheap as shit rn. This company is expecting to produce 2 BILLION doses per year and has many deals established already with multiple countries for \~1.6 Bn doses this year alone. For reference, MRNA announced last week it expects a revenue of $18 Bn dollars in 2021. Guess how many doses they are planning to produce? 600 million. And they have a market cap of 62 Bn.

3) TONS of catalysts coming up.

\-Earnings call on Monday. If they give revenue estimates even half as good as MRNA they will pop to Pluto.

\-EU dose deal and approval. France and UK are already saying they're on the cusp of approval. Literally just waiting for finalization of UK phase 3 data which should come soon (this week? earnings call maybe as they did in the past for nanoFlu phase 3 results?). Approval will be their FIRST approved vaccine ever.

\-South Africa variant vaccine study. They already started developing their South Africa variant vaccine. More updates on this could send the stock up since it actually is for once not far behind MRNA and probably ahead of PFE for this.

\-NanoFlu. 9 months ago they revealed amazing phase 3 data for a new flu vaccine that is better than the current gold standard. They've been blue balling us saying they're almost ready to apply for an EUA since then. IDK when this will happen it seems they have their hands full with covid (maybe even a covid+flu vaccine?) but consider this one a slam dunk.

4) United States market share DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER. Everyone and their dog will say ""ah but they're too late. US already has enough doses for the whole population"". A) This is retarded the US will still buy NVAX doses. They will not be caught with their pants down and run out of vaccines in the future because they decided to be fully dependent on two companies with new vaccine modalities. B) This doesn't matter anyways, they have deals for 1Bn+ vaccines in the rest of the world (including many developed nations). PLUS they'll gobble up US market share eventually if they can get multivariant covid + flu vaccines going.

This company is severely undervalued. Short term price target of $500. This will come after EU approval and potential US EUA based on UK data (crossing my fingers for this). Long term price target of $1000+. 

WARNING this stock is not for paper handed bitches. Expect tons of volatility. However, it is in my opinion a clear slam dunk which has lots of short interest and might even end up in squeeze territory soon.

Positions: Missionary, $220c April 16th, eventually would like to roll out to July expirations. Honestly shares are prob a good way to go with this one. I've been getting my ass handed to me by holding this stock during this pullback but I'm not even scared and I bought even more. Anything under $300 for this stock is a steal."

158,Charles Schwab is hiding a giant ball of shit and won't come out and say what happened. How big is the ball of shit?,2021-02-28 00:53:32,"Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.

I'm just here to tell you the story.

This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)

Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.

Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:

* Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume.
* U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE)
* Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post)
* Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved.
* Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?)
* 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5

**= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""

Important points:

1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue.
2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks.
3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018)
4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...

It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.

**Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**

Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.

159,Why does $AXON have $0 debt on their B.S?,2021-03-01 03:49:25,"I love AXON. I love the stock and I love the company. Sure, they‚Äôve been running a little hot lately, but so has the rest of the market and a slight correction seemed inevitable. They make awesome products, have done a fantastic job integrating a Recurring revenue stream and SaaS model into their product suite, and they‚Äôve seemingly cornered the market and are only just now beginning to expand their Intl footprint (from their 4Q20 call). 
The one thing Im left puzzled by is their lack of debt. On their 4Q20 call and supplemental material they highlighted ‚Äú$0 debt!‚Äù. Maybe an idiot or pure operator who knows nothing about finance would see that and celebrate it, but not only has the cost of debt been at all time lows, we know from M&amp;M prop I &amp; II that a company‚Äôs capital structure absolutely affects its value. 
It is smart for all companies to have debt, especially publicly traded companies unless they believe their stock is trading above fair market value in which case they‚Äôd sell stock to raise capital (which AXON did on the 4thQ), but in general this feels like a bad strategy and sends the wrong signal to the market. 
AXON‚Äôs cfo seems like a smart enough guy and none of the analyst on the call asked about this, so maybe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing. 
Can anyone shed some light on why AXON is proud to have $0 in debt?"

This firm fought against the shorts for 33 years.

I will start with my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for this DD post ‚Äì I‚Äôm from Ohio. Born and raised. There has been a lot of pain for us Ohioans over the years. The weather here sucks, the Browns were complete GARBAGE for over 2 decades, and recently, a huge General Motors plant closed and cost our state thousands of jobs.

Enter Lordstown Motors and CEO Steve Burns who saw an opportunity to acquire the [3rd most productive automotive plant](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) in the country for pennies on the dollar and initially target fleet customers (a [very specific niche](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-surpasses-100-000-124500104.html)) with [disruptive technology](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/best-2020-lordstown-motors-wheel-hub-motors/) in their vehicles.

**LM is just a start-up.. Is this another Nikola?**

No. This is very real, and yet Nikola‚Äôs market cap is somehow over 2x LM‚Äôs. [Recent confirmation](https://insideevs.com/news/490176/lordstown-motors-teases-beta-endurance-building/) by the CEO indicates that LM‚Äôs flagship Endurance truck is 97% ready, and will be [shown in action as a proof of concept](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-unveils-truck-for-race-in-mexican-desert/) in April. Production will begin this September ‚Äì the first ever electric pick-up truck to hit the road.

**How in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the country?**

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow LM to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays, a 24/7 tech hotline and Good Sam‚Äôs Roadside Assistance Program, Lordstown Motors customers are expected to enjoy one of the most comprehensive EV support systems ever designed.

This partnership might not seem like a big deal on the surface, but it‚Äôs basically giving LM an instant country-wide presence for its customers at a tiny fraction of the cost that it would take to build their own service centers. This is HUGE.

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles have been officially announced: an [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and an [electric RV](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34980821/lordstown-camping-world-electric-rv/) in partnership with Camping World.

**Areas for concern:**

This is pretty obvious. Some folks are skeptical because Lordstown Motors is a ‚Äústart-up‚Äù and will have to compete against larger companies. Analyst price targets range from as low as $18 to as high as $50.

But speaking of being skeptical, [I thought THIS TWEET from the Camping World CEO yesterday](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1365670229024645121?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) was interesting. He seems to be VERY confident in [what LM is doing](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

**My position:**

950 shares. The CEO Steve Burns is a very intelligent man, and I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute. Most people don‚Äôt know that 17 years ago, [he developed the technology patents that were eventually used for Apple‚Äôs Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

**Final comment:**

I made this post to increase awareness for a company that I think is flying under the radar to most investors. There is also a really high short interest right now as the whole EV market has sold off. I think all of the shorts are about to get squeezed.

168,"AMC in-depth DD. NOT AN ""I FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO GO UP"" post.",2021-03-01 11:55:32,"THIS IS NOT A FUCKING SHORT SQUEEZE/GAMMA SQUEEZE POST FOR FUCKS SAKE I UNDERSTAND IT'S MORE THAN A POSSIBILITY BUT JESUS FUCK NO

This information was made available to me by a personal friend who has a deep background in finance as well as a student at Stony Brook in NY for 3 years.

Disclaimer: I'm personally bullish on the stock just like everyone else is on this stock but I simply don't let things like ""I have a feeling it's going up"" or ""stonks only go up"" be a part of my mantra or analysis although most of you retards do.

The information I have available is from a 65 page financial and analytical report in regard to AMC that my friend made available to me that's only made available to students at Stony Brook and NYU who have access to the financial report database that accredited investors and business finance analysts regularly write in that rely heavily on the fundamental business analysis(dudes look to see if the company is good and give their opinion)

***Bullish Signals***

Figure 1: Institutional Ownership up 65% Institutions held 40.9 million shares at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional holdings in AMC Entertainment increased by 16,151,852 shares (65.3%) at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional ownership is now 71.0% of the issued capital. (**More institutional investors who are smarter than the average fuck face on WSB see fundamental/intrinsic value in a company that otherwise would go unnoticed since AMC is widely regarded as a dying company**)

Figure 2: AMC Entertainment is ranked number 9 out of 12 listed commercial services companies in the United States with a market capitalization of $523.1 million. In the commercial services companies it has the 3rd highest total assets and 2nd highest revenues.**(This information directly conflicts the bearish sentiment on most bearish analysis that AMC as far as assets and revenues doesn't do enough to stay alive from year to year)**

Figure 3: Quarterly Report (Q3/2020): November 04, 2020 Quarterly Report Analysis Q3 2020: AMC Entertainment reports 532% sequential rise in Quarterly Revenue AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), announced total revenue of $120m for the quarter-ended 30 September 2020 \[Q3/2020\], up 532.3% from the previous quarter \[Q2/2020\] and down 90.9% from the year-earlier period \[Q3/2019\]. Quarterly Report (Q3 2020) Compared with the Previous Corresponding Period \[PCP; Q3/2019\], year-over-year \[y.o.y.\] Revenue was down 90.9%. Read more in SECTION on Financials Q3 2020, FY 2019, Past 7 Years **(This information directly suggests that although AMC struggled in the past that it was making encouraging signs of growth)**

Figure 4: Rising Relative Strength: The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 81 in the NYSE market of 1,808 stocks, 273 units and 111 preference stocks which means it is beating 81% of the market. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ A price rise combined with a high relative strength is a bullish signal. ‚Ä¢ Also, the relative strength percentile is rising at 81 for 6 months, 98 for 3 months and 100 for 1 month. **(This for me IMO is the most apparent bullish signal in regard to AMC because it directly reflects the public sentiment towards the company itself &amp; what I mean about public sentiment is institutional investors and retail traders giving the stock price substantial growth since the pandemic)**

Figure 5: The debt to equity ratio of 7.4% is under a safe benchmark figure of 50%. Moreover, it has improved from 40.1% a year ago.

Years Debt to Equity (%)

Dec 2019 7.38

Dec 2018 40.08

Dec 2017 31.54

Dec 2016 220.76

Dec 2015 130.93

**(companies should aim for a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0, meaning that the firm holds an equal balance of debt to equity. In a perfect world, though, a low debt-to-equity ratio - say, 0.30 - is better, as it indicates the firm has not accumulated a lot of debt and doesn't have to face onerous loan/credit interest payments, which is always good for the corporate bottom line. Lenders and investors tend to favor companies that demonstrate they're using less leverage and that they hold a more solid equity position.**

**Obviously, a business wants its income to exceed its liabilities. But if that doesn't happen, and debt exceeds assets, that's a big red flag for a company (especially a smaller, newer one) and could mean a company can't pay its debts.**

**That's why, when evaluating a company's overall financial health, and its debt burden, a debt to equity is a due diligence necessity for a company, and needs to be constantly measured.)**

Figure 6: Revenue growth has shown signs of recovery in recent quarters.

Sep 20 \[Q3 vs Q2\] (Revenue Growth) 532.3% (Net Profit Margin) -758%

Jun 20 \[Q2 vs Q1\] (Revenue Growth) -98% (Net Profit Margin)-2,969.3%

**(This reiterates my observations from earlier claiming that AMC has had positive growth it still has struggled to do so.. The reason as to why is debatable for instance most people say it's because their business model is outdated and hasn't strived to innovate as far as experience &amp; service provided)**

An increase in total shares on issue is an unfavorable indicator in Joseph Piotroski's 9 indicators. **(this gives a particularly bearish sentiment because of share dilution which we saw again recently)**

Figure 4: In the past 4 years Market Capitalization has decreased by $3.6 billion (87%) from $4.1 billion to $523.1 million. Based on a dynamic start date of 4 years ago, there have been declines in MCap in 3 out of 4 years. Price MCap ($ M)

**This information isn't enough for me to place a bearish indicator for me especially with the bear information above.**

Based on all factors noted above (yes I understand there are way more that factor into the overall sentiment) I believe the Pros outweigh the Cons and for that reason I'm in.

170,SPY 410 by 3/31: A Smoothest Brain DD,2021-03-01 01:29:31,"Somebody smarter than me correct my smooth brain DD here. 

US Equity Market is roughly 33 Trillion Dollars. US Bond Market in 2017 was around 44 Trillions USD (lets inflate that to 60 Trillion in 2021). 

The treasuries amount to roughly 40% of that, which is 24 Trillion. During last month's Treasury sell offs (and hence, increased rates) would have handed Bond Investors some 3.3 Trillion in cash on hand. 

Since, the story is hope of exploded pent up demand and faster than expected vaccinations, they will want to move the cash to equities for higher risk/returns. That means, 3.3 Trillion will start flowing to economy in some form. Given that S&amp;P is 80% of US Equity (0.8\*33 = 26.4 Trillion), we can expect some 2.64 Trillion (0.8\*3.3) to flow into S&amp;P making the valuation to be 33+2.64 = 35.64 Trillion. That's a 8% boost on S&amp;P Index.

172,Moderna (MRNA) DD ‚Äì Why a 60B Company is Still Undervalued,2021-02-28 17:51:02,"\*This will be my first DD post so let me know if you would like to hear about anything I didn‚Äôt touch on, or if you disagree on any particular points. Hopefully you find it useful!

**Overview**

This is going to be a long post, so I‚Äôm not going to waste your time by explaining who Moderna is. They‚Äôve been in the news for the last year and everyone and their mother knows what they‚Äôve accomplished. They (along with Pfizer/BioNTech) are the big dogs when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S., and their dominance in the market will likely continue.

But Moderna isn‚Äôt just a COVID-19 vaccine company, as their CEO repeatedly stressed in their most recent earnings call. Moderna is a true pharmaceutical giant in the making. They are currently developing 24 different products ranging from viral vaccines, to treatments for autoimmune disease, to cancer and heart disease therapeutics.^(1) The vast majority of these modalities are using mRNA technology to attempt to accomplish the desired effect. Not so coincidentally sharing the same name as Moderna‚Äôs ticker, mRNA technology is a relatively new modality that is just beginning to take hold as a game-changer in the biotech/pharma space. Let‚Äôs talk a little more about it so we can understand why it has the potential to create a major-shake up in the pharmaceutical industry.

**History of mRNA Technology**

mRNA was discovered in the 60‚Äôs in mice, but it wasn‚Äôt seriously considered for a possible therapeutic target until the 90‚Äôs. Various studies in vitro and in mice since this period have been done, demonstrating potential for the treatment of HIV, cancer, degenerative disease, autoimmune disease‚Ä¶ I could go on. As we know, pharmaceuticals move slowly, and serious development of these products didn‚Äôt really take off until the 2010‚Äôs.^(2)

Prior to December 2020, there were only two medications utilizing mRNA technology that have received FDA approval. Inotersan and Patisiran were both developed and FDA approved in 2018 to treat a rare hereditary condition called hATTR which involves pathologic deposition of amyloid into the tissues of those affected. Without going into too much detail, this condition has a mean survival time of 15 years after diagnosis and leads to significant patient morbidity and suffering in the interim. Inotersan is the more successful of the two drugs and looks to be potentially curative for some patients with a disease which used to be a death sentence. Routine imaging since the phase III trials for Inotersan shows little to no progression of the disease in most patients, laying out the possibility that these patients may live a normal life moving forward.^(3)

With two more successful examples of mRNA technology being used in the COVID-19 vaccines, I expect that interest in the technology will skyrocket and subsequently so will funding and development.

**First Mover‚Äôs Advantage**

This will be a short section; Moderna is THE biggest player in developing mRNA therapeutics. There are other companies like BioNTech, CureVac, Gradalis, and Ionis, and of these only BioNTech (BNTX) can compete in sheer breadth of product development as well as having a history of success. For the sake of time I won‚Äôt address the other companies, but a key advantage that Moderna has over BioNTech is that they have moved more quickly through their clinical trials than BNTX has. Outside of COVID-19, Moderna currently has 4 products in Phase II trials (with their CMV vaccine moving to Phase III very soon), while BNTX only has 1.^(4) Long term I believe both of these companies will be highly successful, but Moderna is a more mature company that will be seeing the fruits of their labors more quickly than their competitor(s).

**The Future of COVID-19 Vaccination, and Vaccination in General**

Moderna currently has about 60% market share, distributing 40M of the 70M total doses the U.S. has received. I expect that number to drop slightly, but I would expect that Moderna ends up vaccinating approximately 40% of all Americans when it‚Äôs all said and done, with Pfizer vaccinating a large chunk of the rest. After that, Moderna will likely shift distribution to other countries and deliver on their agreements abroad.

‚ÄúBut what about NovaVax, J&amp;J, and AstraZenica?‚Äù you might ask.

Without undercutting these companies and their potential, they are simply too late to the game in the U.S. to grab meaningful market share from Moderna and Pfizer.^(5,6) Johnson and Johnson was just recommended for authorization yesterday (2/26/2021) and will likely begin distribution in the coming weeks, however they are only expected to deliver 100M vaccines by the end of June. Moderna will deliver 300M by July^(7), on top of the approximately 40M they have already delivered. The U.S. has agreed to purchase more than 1.2B doses of the vaccine from a number of companies, but much of that will go overseas after American citizens have received their 2 doses.

Moderna is establishing relationships and trust globally with the successful development and distribution of their COVID-19 vaccine, but why is this important? Let‚Äôs think back to what the CEO said in their recent earnings call ‚Äì Moderna is NOT a COVID-19 company. Digging into their therapeutics pipeline, we can see mRNA candidates targeting Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, Nipah Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Epstein-Barr, Zika, Chikungunya‚Ä¶ Relationships established during this pandemic will serve them well in the development and distribution of future vaccine candidates like those listed above.

WAIT there‚Äôs more: back in January, Moderna announced plans to create a combination Influenza/COVID-19 vaccine, with the possibility of adding more candidates to the mix if they were to receive approval. With the number of viruses that they are targeting, Moderna has the potential to become the leader in vaccination globally, period. Their ability to create combination vaccines targeting a host of common viruses could be the new standard in vaccination. Certain candidates like RSV, CMV, and EBV are likely to become standard vaccinations given in childhood like other vaccines we are familiar with such as MMR and Varicella.

The potential of this company in the vaccination industry is endless, and right now they are just scratching the surface.

**Future Revenue Projections ‚Äì $18 Billion --&gt; ???**

During their most recent earnings call, Moderna reported that they have orders for their vaccine totaling $18 billion^(8), and they are expecting more orders throughout the year. The COVID vaccine market is likely to cool off a little after that, but experts currently predict that COVID-19 boosters will become a routine part of care in the future, likely needing a new dose every 2-3 years.^(9) Now this would likely represent a major hit to revenue if Moderna was just a COVID-19 vaccine company but once again, they are not.

Lets briefly talk about a virus you may have never heard of before ‚Äì cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is something you‚Äôve likely had in the past and didn‚Äôt know it, so why is it a problem? Oddly enough, this seemingly benign little virus causes about 25,000 birth defects per year in the U.S. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 1000 babies will be born with a birth defect due to CMV.

Currently there is no vaccine, but do you know who has the most promising candidate that is already enrolling participants for phase III trials? You guessed it ‚Äì Moderna. The addressable market for this vaccine is conservatively estimated at $2-5 billion/year.^(10) I expect that if it is approved by the FDA that it will likely see global adoption and that revenue number is likely to be much higher.

Repeat the above for RSV, EBV, Zika, etc. and it is not hard to envision a company that is bringing in $30-50 billion a year in annual vaccination income alone. If they were to succeed in any of their more lofty quests to develop an HIV vaccine, or therapeutics for autoimmune hepatitis, or personalized cancer vaccines‚Ä¶ the sky is the limit.

**Justifying Current Valuation, and Then Some**

Moderna‚Äôs current market cap is 62.16B. Their orders for 2021 currently exceed $18B with room to grow. The average revenue multiple for a biotech company is between 6-8x, and Moderna is trading at less than 4x. If you consider Moderna a pharmaceutical company, than the average multiple would be about 5x, still under.^(11)

I know we are looking at unrealized revenue with Moderna at this point, as that $18B will be earned throughout the year, so I understand that technically speaking they are still trading at an obscene P/S ratio compared to other more mature companies. However, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that demand for their product isn‚Äôt going away anytime this year and they have proven that they are able to execute and even exceed expectations when it comes to manufacturing and distributing their product.

Looking at their most recent earnings report for Q420 which was released on 2/25/21, their balance sheet is stellar. They are holding around $3B in cash from recent deposits, and they have almost no debt to speak of.

Simply put, they are undervalued at their current price. Without even factoring in the potential of everything else in their pipeline, they should be worth more as just a COVID-19 company with stellar financials and a relatively palatable multiple going into the later part of this year.

My personal price target: $220/share. With 396M outstanding shares, a $220 share price would place Moderna at $87B, which I believe to be a fair valuation through this year. This would represent a 4.8x multiple to their projected revenue in 2021. This represents a 41% increase in price from where Moderna is trading at currently which is \~$155/share.

**Closing**

Understand that this company has enormous potential for growth, but also potential to fail. Most pharmaceutical products fail in clinical trials before ever reaching market, and the same could be true for most if not all of Moderna‚Äôs pipeline. I personally believe that mRNA products have a higher chance of success than traditional therapeutics, but I‚Äôm not going to go into my reasoning for that in this post.

Every trade carries risk, and the risk with buying Moderna is that the market for COVID-19 vaccines shrinks as the world gradually develops herd immunity, the rest of their products fail in clinical trials, and they die a slow death without ever bringing another product to market. Nonetheless, I am confident and hopeful that this will not happen, and Moderna will become the next company to join the ranks of Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and company as a true juggernaut of the biotech/pharma sector.

*Disclosures: I own shares in Moderna, and I am considering buying leaps at some point next week. I am not a financial advisor, always do your own due diligence before investing in the market.*

173,"The Yield Curve and You, A Primer",2021-03-01 00:28:44,"TLDR up front for the smooth brains: low fed rate make inflation, inflation make long term bond prices go ouchy, so short long term bonds as a hedge against inflation and collect your tendies.

Tldr;Tldr: Buy TMV

In depth for grown ups:

Low fed rate = borrowing money is easy/cheap = public companies boom = the stock market booms = long term treasury bonds must increase yield to remain a viable investment = long term treasury bonds must decrease price to increase yield= TMV 3x leveraged bear 20+ year treasury bond ETF will print until the fed rate is hiked back up.

So how does the yield curve fit into this? Basically it‚Äôs all about what the 10 year treasury yield is doing. If it‚Äôs much higher than the 2 year yield, then the curve is STEEPENING which means there is inflation risk. Which it‚Äôs starting to do now. 

Are we at risk for a market crash? Not really right now. Out of the past 13 major market crashes, the yield curve has been INVERTED for several weeks and this pattern has become one of the most important forward looking indicators of an impending crash. Right now it‚Äôs going in the opposite direction.

So, yield curve STEEP and UPHILL (right now)? Stocks are doing great but inflation is a problem. Keep buying your stocks but also short long term bonds for extra tendies. Throw some cash into commodities if you want to feel like a smart warren buffet boomer.

How about yield curve FLAT or DOWNHILL or INVERSED? (Not now) Crash incoming. sell all your ARKK shares, be really nice to your boss while praying to whatever diety you believe in that you won‚Äôt be ripped away from your wage slave job, make sure you call and see if your parents still have your childhood bedroom available so you have somewhere to go after your wife and her boyfriend force your worthless ass to move out.

176,Is the TESLA #TSLA Hype over or we are heading to new Highs soon?,2021-02-28 17:47:40,"Last week was a good week for all the Tesla sceptics who are waiting for the so-called ""Hype"" to be over and the price to drop. But are they right? Let's look at some of the macro and micro trends and let's see where the share price could be possibly heading.

**1. Macro:**

* In the US, Biden has made it clear that the EV boom is just getting started. This means, that those who are already ahead of the curve are in a very strong position.
* He made it clear that we are going to see a major shift, stating he plans to replace the entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles.
* That includes 245,000 in various federal agencies‚Ä¶ 225,000 in the United States Postal Service‚Ä¶ and another 173,000 in the military.
* That adds up to a grand total of 643,000 cars, trucks, and vans set for an upgrade on the U.S. government‚Äôs dime.¬†
* Also across the world, more countries are following or have already started.
* For example, Norway imposed several changes in the government years ago just like the United States, and it‚Äôs led to a sweeping transformation.¬†
* In fact, 54% of all vehicles sold in the country last year were electric vehicles.

**2. Micro:**

* Tesla's forecast in terms of deliveries is looking very promising.
* Deliveries are expected to rise from about 500,000 last year to 894,000 this year and 5 million by 2024. By 2030, annual deliveries could climb to about 9 million.
* This is mainly due to increased efficiencies in the production and new productions plants being built in China, Germany and Texas
* Some analysts also expect that Tesla could be generating 37bn free cash flow by 2025; just as a comparison Facebook is currently generation 23bn.

To summarise: Before any sceptics get too happy, Tesla is still a very much hold for us and some well-known analysts even anticipate the **price to head towards $1200 next year**.

Perfect way to hedge against market crash is what I read, plus it's the sauce on top of GME causing market wide volatility.
Why would I not like my GME tendies with VIX sauce? 

My order for monday: 
-VIX 80 Call 17MAR21 @ $0,20
-VIX 110 Call 17MAR21 @ $0,05
wil update with positions once order has gone through.

By the way, I noticed how the same VIX calls are like 4x as expensive in April compared to March. Is this possible hedging by funds for the disaster to come? 
Are there any reasons to believe that the market goes nuts especially in April compared to march? 
I know that DFV's GME calls expire in April; would they be expecting the distaster to come by then? 

Wil a geomagnetic reversal happen in which Earth's magnetic poles switch, causing our Earth to not be shielded from solar flares and high velocity charged particles (would probably cause some nice volatility)

You'll actually know when it happens.

While it is nice, does not help whatsoever. I'm simply asking. For once, please just don't be greedy. I understand we come to reddit to see if the squeeze is happening, since most of us don't know how or don't want to read charts and such. If you see the price starting to go up and up, don't get peoples hopes up by posting what I said above. 

If you see posts like that, keep scrolling past it since there are bots and shills here who definitely will post crap like that to get FUD into your heads. I promise you, if we just hold and keep on holding to our shares, it will EVENTUALLY happen. Just because it isn't happening at this moment does not mean it wont happen. It will.

Here are the facts -&gt; They NEED our shares.

Reasons for commodity supercycle thesis include: 

- weakening dollar
- covid demand/supply structural mismatch (similar to semiconductor dynamics, or any consumer electronic company like gaming or cameras etc).
- chronic underinvestment in commodity production assets for 10-20 years 
- rising rates
- inflation thesis, or tail % change of hyperinflation
- Hot economies globally (5-6% US GDP growth, 11% India, I dunno about China or Europe).
- Synchronized global response to post covid nation-building (a la WWII) but perhaps even bigger and more global. I think this one is under appreciated in magnitude.
- global green energy transition requires a pull forward of raw material input
- global EV transition requires a pull-forward in material input.
- global housing boom (desire to own vs rent + urban exodus, remote work. Millennial demo coming into home buying globally) requires a massive pull forward in raw materials inputs.

191,How to Grow a Meme Stock Portfolio,2021-02-28 21:44:48,"I don‚Äôt want to waste anyone‚Äôs time, so if you‚Äôre only trading with the remains of your stimulus check, close this post now. Sorry, you just don‚Äôt have the proper capital to play. Ideally, you need at least $2k for this strategy to be worth your time.

Now that we got that out of the way, let‚Äôs dive in!

The first thing you need to do is learn how to use the Poor Man‚Äôs Covered Call (PMCC) strategy. PMCCs are a leveraged version of traditional CCs. All you do is buy LEAPS and sell short dated calls against it. We use LEAPS because they mimic 100 shares of a stock and you can usually get them 30-50% cheaper than buying 100 shares. You leverage junkies should really like that.

Next, pick your favorite meme stock and start your PMCC. This alone is a highly profitable strategy because meme stocks have high IVs, so you‚Äôll be collecting a lot of premium on the calls you sell. Don‚Äôt get overly excited yet, you‚Äôre not going to become a millionaire from doing this alone. There‚Äôs still one more step.

I know, I‚Äôm putting too much stress on your small attention span. It‚Äôs okay though, we are on the final step. Once you have a decent amount of cash built up from the premium you‚Äôve been collecting, you can either open up another PMCC on the meme stock you‚Äôre currently using, or open a PMCC for another meme stock. If you‚Äôve done this properly, you‚Äôve now doubled your premium intake.

You just keep doing this strategy over and over again, letting your portfolio get loaded with the latest meme stocks. Before you know it, you‚Äôll have a piece of every meme stock!

If your brain at least half functions, I‚Äôm sure you can see how this strategy is so powerful. You get to build a massive portfolio full of meme stocks ready to moon for free! All of your new meme stocks are paid for by previously purchased meme stocks. On top of that, you have a steady and ever increasing stream of cash flowing in from premium. 

Go ahead and tell your wife‚Äôs boyfriend all about it. Prove to him that you‚Äôre the smartest autist around.

Edit: Please ignore the comments from LanoLikesTheStock. The user spewed a ton of false information about the strategy due to his/her lack of understanding. 

I provided a link to a YouTube video somewhere in that comment thread that gives a proper explanation of the PMCC strategy. 

Please help get rid of those comments, thanks!"
192,Trends consensus and you,2021-02-28 21:28:42,"Okay so short little tidbit from a vet member. Last year around this time wsb was hard on the spy 200p wagon (myself included) we saw circuit breakers multiple days and got drunk on our own bias and it all made so much sense at the time I mean we had variationseperate our profit wcgw. As you know a ton of us got smoked me especially in ulta puts (I'm a retard). This whole gme situation has changed in January it was a different beast now there is such a strong mob mentality that the shorts have to squeeze but realize what has actually happened.

Both large run ups were started by large whales purchasing a huge volume of high delta calls. The first was then extended by a social media rally. The main reason this rally died was due to a large volume of call options closing out and locking in profit. When a call is closed the market maker will sell the previously held shares they bought to hedge thier delta, and freeing those up to be borrowed to short. 

Do I think it will run again? Sure but be warned each time it spikes calls will close and flood the market with shares, also put volume has jumped considerably which market makers purchase shorts to delta hedge these. Long story short wsb just dosnt have the capital currently to move this stock considerably and has been riding among whales as an easy media scapegoat. If you think well the 9 million here only have to own x shares, realize people rarely put thier money where there mouth is and are just watching for entertainment.

Tldr; be careful stock may pop but each time will be smaller and smaller unless some very large catalyst comes along to blow it up. Still like it long term but will wait for the hype to die down a bit in the next two weeks"
193,FHA housing mortgage delinquency rates.,2021-02-28 14:02:09,"So I was looking at mortgage delinquency rates, overall they have been dropping.....except for FHA and VA loans which are at all time highs.
My second point I would like some help on would be mortgages in forbearance.
I asked myself are loans in forbearance count towards mortgage delinquency rates and this is what I found.
     Borrowers in a¬†forbearance program¬†who have missed a mortgage payment are¬†included¬†in the CoreLogic¬†delinquency statistics, even if the loan servicer has not reported the loan as¬†delinquent¬†to credit repositories. ... Only servicers providing loan-level¬†forbearance¬†information were¬†included¬†in the analysis.
The last sentence has me worried.  Can we find out what services include this data as well as those that don't?
   I recall reading an article that stated the total amount of mortgages in delinquency that are in forbearance  are at 2/3. How can we verify this data. It's also a little hard to find articles about the FHA rates, it strikes me as odd seeing mostly news about the national average going down. I feel that the most important home buyer metric would be new buyers. If almost  15% of new home buyers are in delinquency those levels are coming close to 2008 levels at 22%. 

   How could I dig into this further. Hopefully places with hard data and no fluff.
I'm not saying housing crash, however I feel that this should be studied a bit.

One of the reasons is I don't or can't talk to anyone right now about Gme for obvious reasons. ""sell that shit, the volume doesn't look right, well TV said this bla bla bla"" 

JUST FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS. Jesus christ buddha

No proof or DD just opinions. 

1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits. 

2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will. 

3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv. 

4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.

Below are just rants now. 

5. The squeeze is real. Read 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3

6. You ain't diamond hands unless you read like 20 DDs minimum a day. To be a diamond hand, don't worry about shills and all those short ladder attack, Silver, open court cases, short interests reports, dips, tweets etc, because read 1, 2 and 3. That's all you need to care about. 

7. The more I read DDs since early February, the more I bought in, like 3 times actually. 

8. To me in the beginning, this was not an investment but a BET. Hence wsB. But the bet payout was this:

A. In the beginning my head was, spend 10 dollars, you get 3 outcomes. You only lose maybe 1 to 3 dollars Max, if you bought low like 40 to 60 maybe. Ok we lose SOME money, just don't eat out next time or work an extra week or something for those of us fortunate to do so. Remember this is a BET. don't use what you can't afford. 

B. You break even and get your money back, GME ain't going bankrupt ever, read the DDs, Ryan Cohen and crew. Also read 1 2 and 3, it's in media now. 

C. With 10 dollars you make $1000 right? Win win? Nah dog, this payout is going to be 100k share +. Again read 1, 2 and 3. And now this went from a BET to an investment. Why? Because I don't bet what I can't win. I'm cheap like that. 

9. Now people are day trading. To me it's like buying a 20 dollar scratch ticket to win 40 dollars. Then betting and buying more scratch ticket hoping you win, yall gonna sell and miss the squeeze guys, read 1 2 and 3 HODL. OR you can buy a 1 dollar scratch ticket, HODL for a rainy day and win 100k or more, multiplier of other apes holding too.

10. This is a once and lifetime opportunity. It's like going on let's make a deal TV show. You take the $2000 cash instead of picking what's behind curtain 1 2 and 3. Where in this case the curtain is certainly going to have alot more money and there's literally no zonks. Why? Read 1 2 and 3, that's why yall should HODL. 

This is a roller-coaster of a ride. It went from me wanting to screw hedge funds over to me paying off my cc debts, to me paying off my house to me retiring, to me now wanting to do philanthropy and open businesses to help the regular folk and change peoples lives. But you can't do that shit with 10k a share or even 100k a share. It needs  fuck you money. Let's ALL make fuck you money guys. Apes strong, thanks for listening. I have no one to share this ride with. Please don't block me. Good luck guys, stay safe. Get some fucking sleep and stop reading reddit so much and just watch the ticker, cuz it's going to blast off as long as we hold. Why? Read 1, 2 and 3.

This is not financial advice etc. Just observation and personal opinions. Im pretty sure there's real data out there from those conspiracy heads but I'm too lazy to prove it and you know, read #2. This could all also blow over and we make no profit and doesn't blast off cuz why? Read #2.

TLDR: companies caught with pants down doing shady things for profit. We found out, it's an opportunity for a squeeze. All you need to know is these guys will do whatever it takes to get away with it. Hold, don't sell low, no need to day trade, wait for the squeeze, and we all make fuck you money. Everything else isn't worth reading or worrying about. God speed.

195,$APHA shareholders stand to gain ‚Äúfree money‚Äù via the gap when the $TLRY deal closes,2021-02-28 17:25:38,"üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Aphria $APHA cultivates and sells medical and recreational cannabis through retail and wholesale channels in Canada and internationally. 



üöÄ On Dec. 16, Aphria and Tilray $TLRY announced a merger to form the largest cannabis company in the worldby revenue. The company will keep the Tilray name, including the ability to consolidate production in Canada, combine alcohol and CBD businesses in the United States in preparation for potential federal legalization, and the ability to combine efforts in Europe.



üöÄ In a reverse merger structure, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria
share, implying a 23% premium to Tilray‚Äôs share price before the announcement. Given relative sizes,
Aphria shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company and get seven of the nine board
seats. Tilray CEO and Chairman Brendan Kennedy will get one of Tilray‚Äôs two board seats, while Aphria
CEO and Chairman Irwin Simon will keep both roles in the combined company.



üöÄ Its pending merger with Tilray boosts its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Deal terms seem fair to both sides. Aphria added recreational cannabis after Canada‚Äôs legalization in October 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Aphria‚Äôs recreational and wholesale cannabis revenue accounted for roughly 41% of total cannabis and distribution revenue. Unlike many of Aphria‚Äôs competitors that immediately focused on creating consumer packaged goods for the recreational market, Aphria initially focused on flower and vape. However, it is now beginning to expand into edibles.



üöÄ On Feb. 1, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Ron
Wyden announced their intentions to push major federal cannabis legislation. They plan to release a
discussion draft in the early part of this year. Legalization is likely going to take a couple of
years, as forecasts estimate a change to federal law by 2023. Nevertheless, legalization sooner than that
would unlock growth and capital access sooner but doesn‚Äôt change our estimated market potential of
$85 billion by 2030 compared with an estimated $15 billion in 2020, according to the Marijuana
Business Daily.



üöÄ Aphria has an extensive international distribution business, which generated the majority of net revenue in 2020, a far larger portion than many of its Canadian cannabis peers. The global market looks lucrative given higher realized prices and growing acceptance of the medical benefits of cannabis. Exportersbmust pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants like Aphria.
Due to climate, much of Canada‚Äôs cultivation is in greenhouses or indoors. Recent expansions in outdoor production are likely limited to extracted products due to quality. Aphria revised plans to build
production in Colombia due to high capital costs, instead exporting global medical markets from its
Canadian facilities. 



üöÄ Forecast estimate roughly 16% average annual growth through 2030 for the global
medicinal market excluding Canada and the U.S.
Aphria's 2020 acquisition of SweetWater, a U.S. craft brewery, still leaves it out of the U.S. THC or CBD
market. Its strategy appears to predict that future cannabis distribution looks more like alcohol or tobacco than the current multi-state operator strucure of today. The U.S. offers the fastest growth of any market globally. However, the regulatory environment is murky with individual states legalizing cannabis while it remains illegal federally.  Federal
law will eventually be changed to allow states to choose the legality of cannabis within their borders.



TLDR;; 
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Aphria's merger with Tilray grows its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Aphria‚Äôs focus on strategic SG&amp;A spending and running a lean business model allows it to have a healthy cash balance to fund future operations and investments. Aphria's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers."

199,Shorts are literally running out of bullets.,2021-02-27 17:35:00,"Hi fellow retards!

My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they‚Äôve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation. 

As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they‚Äôre trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they‚Äôre selling off their valuable possessions. So they can‚Äôt borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they‚Äôre selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don‚Äôt give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost. 

The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves. 

Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they‚Äôll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that‚Äôs my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov‚Äôt. Not only that but now they‚Äôre on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I‚Äôm sorry.

TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities. 

My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I‚Äôd be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn‚Äôt financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks."

209,Investing in Uranium/Nuclear Energy - Constraints to Consider,2021-02-28 17:23:26,"I've been seeing a lot of Uranium bull cases on WSB, r/investing, and r/stocks. A main point that keeps getting repeated is Biden = clean energy; nuclear = green energy; nuclear energy investment = sure thing. Unfortunately, I don't think it's quite that simple.


Here are some points you may want to consider before YOLOing all your money. I'm not taking either a bull or bear position, but wanted to lend insight about the industry with my family of Reddit degenerates so we can help each other make money.


Nuclear power is a very productive source of energy globally and, unlike with fossil fuel combustion, its use does not increase greenhouse gas emissions or contribute to acid rain. It is safer to mine than coal, but reactor meltdown and contamination from breached nuclear plants are significantly more hazardous (e.g. Chernobyl, Fukushima Daiichi). In addition, the problem of high-level radioactive waste management has confounded us for decades, and government efforts to address the negative production externalities of nuclear power are a demonstration of spectacular bureaucratic failure. 


Radioactive waste cannot be treated to make it nonradioactive, and thus storage is (currently) the only option. To my understanding, all radioactive waste produced by commercial power plants in the United States are currently in temporary storage, many of which are near capacity. We do have the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ([WIPP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant)) in New Mexico for transuranic waste produced by our government during the creation of nuclear weapons; more than 3.7 million cubic feet of transuranic waste has been received by that facility (about half of its 6.2 million cubic feet capacity), but the site remains dedicated to defense-related radioactive waste containment. Further contributing to our nuclear waste management problem is fact that we do not reprocess our spent commercial reactor fuel elements (unlike France, China, Russia, Japan, and India), and thus create more waste than necessary. 


Improper waste storage is both a safety hazard and extremely costly to clean up as evident by the Hanford, Washington radioactive [waste leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site). An estimated one million gallons of liquid waste escaped from containers in Hanford, with some entering into the Columbia River. The Department of Energy (DOE) spends about $2-3 billion per year on cleanup efforts at the site, but bioremediation, chemical stabilization, storage transfer, and soil decontamination are expected to take many decades and cost over $110 billion. 


The [Nuclear Waste Policy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Waste_Policy_Act) of 1982 intended to establish two commercial waste disposal sites - one in the west and one in the east of the United States (to be determined by DOE) - and formed the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which instituted the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF), supported largely by spent-fuel fees on waste generators and a 0.1 cent per kw-hour surcharge on nuclear powered electricity. To date, over $44 billion was paid into NWF ($750 million annual revenue) to finance disposal site identification costs and over $10 billion has been spent on this effort. 


In 1986, after years of research (considering factors of climate, population density, low regional water table, seismicity, et al.), DOE proposed three potential western area locations for permanent nuclear waste storage: Hanford, WA; Yucca Mountain, NV; and Deaf Smith County, TX. Unsurprisingly, all three states (and Tennessee) protested the nominations. In late 1987, Congress finalized [Yucca Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository) as the selection. Yucca Mountain was already on federally owned land and partially overlaps the Nevada Test Site (used previously for nuclear weapons testing) in Nye County. Despite millions from the NWF in compensation packages offered to the state for hosting high-level waste disposal, the designation and effort still faces bipartisan opposition.    


Yucca Mountain site characterization began in 1986, with the original projection estimating initial construction in 1998 and waste disposal beginning 2003. In reality, the site analysis and DOE‚Äôs environmental impact statement wasn‚Äôt completed/issued until 2002. DOE filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2008 to begin site development, with officials hoping for project completion in 2017. Twenty-seven years later, after many lawsuits, continued opposition from Nevada and environmental groups, and roughly $10 billion spent from when Nuclear Waste Policy Act first began formal efforts to create a permanent disposal system for nuclear waste, the Yucca Mountain project **was ultimately suspended under the Obama administration**. Increased regulatory expectation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2008 further complicated progress toward disposal site design and execution. Back in 1985, the EPA specified that high-level waste was to be confined in a manner that results in fewer than 1,000 fatalities over 10,000 years, which is the predicted rate with unmined uranium ore; the timetable for isolation is now extended to 1 million years.  


With global climate change and pressure to produce more CO2-neutral energy, nuclear power remains an important contributor of global power production (especially for countries with limited access to their own supplies of fossil fuels). Unfortunately, the lingering radioactive byproducts and safety hazards from compromised reactors are externalities for everyone outside of the industry, including those who live in areas not serviced by nuclear power. 


I guess, to be fair, no other nation has a permanent storage facility solution established for their nuclear waste either, so it appears that we are all stuck in this radioactive waste management dilemma together‚Ä¶ except maybe Finland. The [Onkalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository) spent nuclear fuel repository is under construction and anticipated to be operational in 2023 (barring additional setback). The risk of radioactive waste discharge and contamination from impaired permanent containment facilities are also externalities for current and near-future human civilization and whatever mutant race/creatures outlive us. (Hopefully they understand our primitive radioactive warning symbols.)


TL;DR - Nuclear power is a great clean energy source but its growth and adoption is constrained by waste storage.


Good luck to everyone with your investments. I hope we're all rolling in green portfolios and unrealized/realized gains again soon.


Positions: None in **any** energy category (fossil fuels, nuclear, or renewables)





Edit: Position information - expanded to clarify that I am not holding in a competing source; additional note below.





**Why did I even bother writing up the above?**
Answer: My paternal bloodline is notorious for extreme betting and poor financial decisions. Examples: my dad lost 70% of his 401k in bananas - I'm not sure if he bought Chiquita banana stock or futures, but my parents almost got divorced over it and my mom still brings it up to this day. Five of his siblings decided to file for bankruptcy in the span of 2 years as a brilliant plan to buy goods and then not pay for it. My dad's formerly wealthy cousin was so addicted to gambling that his wife and kids nearly left him. His solution was to get his wife hooked on betting too, which she did, and then they lost their house and had to live in a car. My birth family lost all of our meager savings in the stock market dotcom crash because they had no idea what they were doing and just followed trends without DDs. When I read about u/TheEmperorofJenks and his agricultural futures disaster, I called my dad and asked if he had invested in ornamental gourds. He hung up on me. Most of us know WSB is meant to be fun with occasional gems, but with the constant media coverage, we are getting a lot of new users who may lose lots of money trying to find the next rocket. I grew up having to live with the consequences of bad bets, so I'm reclaiming some time to offer a piece of my singular brain wrinkle. 


The long write up is because I was trying to ELY5 for anyone completely new to the sector. If your portfolio is 100% nuclear energy, I genuinely hope it takes off and makes you lots of money. I'm just trying to give another angle so people understand some of the potential hurdles before they go balls deep thinking they've got a sure shot to millions. Invest in whatever you think is a good idea (nuclear power **is** good tech) ‚Äê just research thoroughly, don't over-leverage yourself, and absolutely avoid making your kids suffer by throwing good money after bad."
210,Something Very Big Is Happening - PSLV DD,2021-02-28 18:11:08,"**A post not about GME? Yes, but wait!**

I like GME too and check every day to see if it's on the moon. But I urge you to take a moment to look at some stuff you might have missed. Something very big is happening right in front of us. 

This is not a *this or that* situation. I've been in that ""everything that's not a GME post is a distraction"" mode too. I know what it's like. I just want to be aware of what has been happening outside of GME. I just want you to **pay attention**.

&amp;nbsp;

I want everyone to be able to comprehend what is happening. We all have varying levels of attention spans, so I am going to break this down for 3 types of people:

**FOR WRINKLY üß†'s THAT CAN READ:**

[The silver short squeeze is glaringly obvious to anyone paying attention to the data, the evidence is overwhelming, just take a look for yourself, PSLV](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/)

This is the best DD since the original GME DD. A *must-read*, if you can.


&amp;nbsp;

**FOR üçø NETFLIX &amp; CHILL:**

[Hidden Secrets of Money ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10375812/) is a 10 part mini-series on Youtube. Even just the first episode highlights the absurdity of the situation. This gives the foundation for the magnitude of what we're dealing with.

&amp;nbsp;

**FOR ü¶ç WHO JUST WANT TENDIES:**

Just type ""PSLV"" into the search bar. Look at the first thing that comes up: 
https://imgur.com/ACOfwCm 

Even fucking Google is telling you this PSLV is üöÄüöÄüöÄ

You can't make this shit up.

&amp;nbsp;

In all seriousness, you should really read the [PSLV DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/) and come back. This is an extremely disturbing finding and the only reason it didn't garner more attention is that it was deleted then undeleted after it wasn't on the front page.

Now put 2 and 2 together and consider layer what this DD is uncovering on top of the currency situation. [This](https://preview.redd.it/rxuo34jiqd561.jpg?width=1610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e096a718cda81fbc7ac4ecf161fe2ea3d7d55b2) is the amount of money being created. **35% of all US dollars in existence have been printed in the last 10 months.**

I want you to come to your own conclusions here. It should be exceedingly obvious that something big is happening.

&amp;nbsp;

---
*But why now? This should have happened years ago*

It should have. That Youtube series was made in 2013, we're 8 years overdue. QE had the money printer going *brrr* since '08, and it's only gotten worse. Way, way worse.

As /u/TheHappyHawaiian's [graph](https://preview.redd.it/pk37q11tkmi61.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddd64a50dfc58bf0f5a118951096f7dda5f5c69) shows, the elite are already buying up silver at an incredible rate. So this is probably happening with or without Reddit. But the price of may able to stay suppressed without anyone sounding the alarm for a while.

Except the difference now is, **YOU**. You retards are capable of some amazing things.

Remember that scene from The Big Short where they investigate the housing market by actually checking themselves what was happening down-low? https://streamable.com/2hxpy9

Recently, a silver break-out of wallstreetbets starting urging everyone to start collecting physical silver. They've been calling their local shops, asking if they have any silver, and the shops are all out. Any silver that is remaining is immediately bought up. I urge you, go call your local shop and check if they even have any silver. Turns out most are completely OOS, and go OOS immediately on any new shipments.

If GME shows us anything, it's that decentralized communities are good at exposing bullshit. This starts from the ground-up. You cannot artificially suppress the price of something that is so rare it cannot be obtained.

&amp;nbsp;


*Why silver? Why not Gold or some other metal?*

Please see [What's Wrong With This Picture? -  Precious Metals DD](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpqzsg/whats_wrong_with_this_picture_precious_metals_dd/) (which as also deleted from the wallstreetbets subreddit).

&amp;nbsp;

*PSLV vs. SLV?*

PSLV - You buy their shares, they buy and hold physical silver stored on your behalf. This is regularly audited and you can even go trade in your shares for silver bars if you want.

SLV - You buy their shares, and they *promise* to hold silver. They pinky swear guys!

^‚Äé

^^*Techniquely ^^there ^^is ^^no ^^definitive ^^proof ^^of ^^SLV ^^being ^^fraudulent, ^^but ^^purchasing ^^SLV ^^instead ^^of ^^PSLV ^^is ^^a ^^bit ^^like ^^using ^^Robinhood ^^to ^^purchase ^^GME. ^^If ^^you ^^don't ^^like ^^getting ^^screwed ^^over ^^the ^^choice ^^should ^^be ^^obvious.

&amp;nbsp;

*What's the risk?*

Silver is at the lowest it will ever get. You're buying in at the absolute floor.

2/3 ≥·µà's of the world's total silver has already been mined, and getting the last third is a slow process with diminishing returns. Meanwhile, it is becoming more and more used up in EVs and Renewable Energy. This is inherently deflationary. Silver becomes more precious over-time.

Each PSLV share represents 0.3691 Oz of silver. Your wealth is in a real store of value, while all fiat currencies are being printed at record rates. *Think about that for a moment*. 

If you've been stressed due to having all your money tied up in straight speculation, you can rest easy. This literally cannot go tits up.

&amp;nbsp;

*What's the upside?*

Even without a squeeze, silver climbs to its natural gold:silver ratio price of $112. Other naturalistic projections put silver at $182 by 2023.

In the *glaringly obvious* situation that  /u/TheHappyHawaiian's [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/) outlines, this causes a üöÄ the likes of which we've never seen before.

212,Is NIO ready to skyrocket in 2021?,2021-02-28 19:06:53,"There are many EV manufactures in China (the largest EV market in the world) but NIO is one that always called my attention because of their design, innovation and sales volumes. This brought me to create a projection based on past deliveries, and noticed that  **NIO** might sell more cars in China this December than Tesla. It seems hard to believe but that's why I have attached a table with the raw data so you can do the projection by yourselves. Another point that I‚Äôve considered, was that when comparing January 2021 deliveries to last December, Tesla dropped 35% while **NIO** increased its deliveries by 3%. This is not a lot, but compared to January 2019 NIO increased an impressive 325%.

February **NIO**'s vehicles delivery which is supposed to go out next week will be key to confirm this trend. February of last year was a bad months for **NIO** given the Chinese New Year, and the pandemic. However, if **NIO** was able to deliver more than 1,000 vehicles in February 2021, then it should deliver more that 100,000 total cars in 2021, and maybe overtake Tesla in December as the top EV supplier in China. If achieved, this will mark a big milestone for **NIO**. Sure that 100,000 is shy of the 800.000 cars delivery expected for Tesla in 2021, but it took Tesla 6 years to reach 100,000 vehicles, while NIO might achieve this important milestone in it's forth year. It‚Äôs also important to mention that February is a slow month for car sales in China because of the new year celebrations, therefore all vehicles' manufacturers are expected to report lower sales than in other months.

Usually **NIO** announces past month‚Äôs car delivery at the beginning of the following month, so most likely next week we‚Äôll know how many cars were delivered in February 2021.

I owned 6,000 **NIO**'s shares, and after the price dropped last week I sold 1,000 of my **NIO** shares and bought 150 5 March 21 $50 Call Options with the proceeds.

**So what do you think, should I buy more, hold, or sell?**

While I was looking through studying up on my investments and how they work I stumbled upon this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Replicate Market Conditions?](https://preview.redd.it/51qw17a08ak61.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0073542e7d4313c145b8d9c3f6df8394a5d8142)

 

Etoro only replicates market conditions, meaning you don't actually own what you invest there, no real stake in the company. Now you may be thinking that only cfd labelled assets have that issue and shares bought cash only, no leverage, no shorting, just simply buying shares of a company to own. However, when you invest you have a minimum for stocks of 50$ per investment, no matter how small the price. This tells us that you don't necessarily have to buy in terms of shares, since almost every transaction is made in fractional shares. To me alarm bells are ringing already, why can I buy an exact amount of shares up until it goes below 50$? CRSR is under 50$ so I have to buy more than 1 share and fractional at that?

Look at the last line: If the position closes in profit, the broker pays the trader. If it closes at a loss, the broker charges the trader for the difference. At this point the only thing I can compare this to is a casino, albeit one that tracks the stock market, why? To me it sounds like when I earn a profit they pay me, but when I lose they charge me the difference EXCEPT THIS IS ALL ""REPLICATE MARKET CONDITIONS"", YOU DON'T OWN ANYTHING.

Humor me hear and tell me if I may be missing something. Here's my theory:

Let's assume Etoro is all replicated market conditions, even assets they claim to be real shares, all of it CFD. Now we know they have incentive to let us lose because THEY pay us if we win and WE pay them if we lose as stated by them, all in a virtual market place that imitates ""real market conditions"" but still not real, very much casino-like. They also have data on all trades and accounts in their servers. So where's the catch? Remember all those periods of extended ""maintenance"" during coincidentally key market hours. Let's consider it's exactly an online casino, no shares are real, when you win they lose money and when you lose they gain money. So they have an incentive to make sure you lose money, how do they do this? STATS! They've got data on all the people investing in their platform, they don't have to catch all of you, just enough. So let's say they know 70% of their users have apple avg 120 and expected to increase this week to 135, but suddenly their servers have a ""sudden malfunction"" during prime hours and peak has left many people holding the bag again or having lost a better score/loss. They secure their money and got away with it because how would you prove that their computers didn't malfunction and were just shut off?

They've only gotten increasingly worse the last weeks, 3 in a row and 1 lasting a whole trading day. I can recall several instances trading AMD, AAPL, &amp; AMZN watching it peak and going to sell only to be sent to the maintenance page watching the support team shit out their messages saying the problem is being addressed, waiting literal hours sometimes for it to go back up. By the time it was ""fixed"" the market already dropped and I was left holding for another swing next week/month or selling for a meager profit. They used to post this phrase everywhere in their site, seemed legally mandatory ""over 85% of traders lose when trading CFDs"" it's gone now but it would make sense why people lose when your in a casino. ""The house always wins"" as they say.

Let me know if I missed anything and we can discuss further whether this may or may not be true. I'll also post this on r/etoro to see what they think. I'll also leave a link here for other reference in case people want to discuss more: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrbz4a/etoro\_has\_been\_an\_absolute\_clusterfuck\_lately\_be/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrbz4a/etoro_has_been_an_absolute_clusterfuck_lately_be/)"

Today we see a rebound from some dark days last week. The news is rapidly building with stimulus checks, central banks pushing inflation and private investors diving deep into indices. 
I think that we need to be careful what the recovery rates will be after our beloved (not) crisis. 
I think there is so much fresh cash entering the market that we continue to see higher highs upcoming weeks, but what will happen when we can move a bit beyond our current lockdowns is more scary and interesting.
Will private investors pull their money and start a selling frenzy or will they see the profits and extra dime as a ongoing event?

220,"(GME DD) Why the Volkswagen Comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought, but in A DIFFERENT WAY",2021-02-27 18:36:58,"Hey folks!
I‚Äôm not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I‚Äôve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we‚Äôve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.

Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I‚Äôm not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:

So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: ‚Äúwell, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101).
I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:




TL;DR:
You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.



Let‚Äôs explain that for those that don‚Äôt immediately get the logic.
Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:

you start with ~0~ shares
you borrow one from a broker
you now have ~1~ shares
you sell that share, completing your short
you now have ~0~ shares

Now imagine the short squeeze happens.
And let‚Äôs say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc.
The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).

Now here‚Äôs the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high:
Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital. 
You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.

you start with ~0~ shares
you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker!
you sell a ‚Äúshare‚Äù, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped ‚Äúsometime soonish maybe‚Äù
you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!

Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with! 
Thus, you can‚Äôt give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value: 

THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO
The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt squeezed yet?

Here‚Äôs where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME‚Äôs nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy.
Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.


If you‚Äôve gotten this far, congratulations.
Now think about that again.


Effective TL;DR 2.0:

People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule?
Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.

But here‚Äôs MY question:
What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it? 
VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it‚Äôs an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we‚Äôve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.


Please reflect on this and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I hope I‚Äôm not.
Joy to all,

221,"When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next.",2021-02-27 23:13:01,"I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.

By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.

Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/

First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! 

Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. 

Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. 

By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.

Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.

When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.

UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!

Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.

Space Ape out

TLDR: 

* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU
* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI
* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot
* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds
* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon

222,Is $PLTR still a Buy after insider stock sell off?,2021-02-28 03:50:17,"Palantir Technologies‚Äô 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter came in well above prior expectations and management‚Äôs guidance. The company is also benefiting from the transition to a software-based firm and its efforts to more efficiently deliver and scale its products.

¬†

In the quarter, government sales increased by 85% and commercial revenue grew by 4% year over year. While commercial growth was slower than anticipated, Palantir‚Äôs 2021 focus of expanding its direct sales force and channel partnerships to accelerate this segment. Palantir is showing strong momentum with growing sales and margins with its existing customer base, diversification among its revenue streams, and ability to land new clients. Average revenue per customer increased by 41% year over year to $7.9 million. Annual revenue from top 20 customers increased by 34% year over year to $663 million, while the customer concentration from those top 20 customers declined to 61%.from 67% the year before. Palantir closed more than 21 deals in the quarter worth at least $5 million, with 10 of those worth at least $10 million. Adjusted gross and operating margins of 84% (81% last quarter) and 32% (25% previous quarter), respectively, were ahead of our prior expectations as revenue outpaced expenses, Palantir lowered its cloud hosting costs, and go to market efficiency gains are decreasing upfront software deployment costs.




Palantir is well suited to help organizations consolidate and harness the power of data. Between a leading position in the government sector with the U.S. and its allies and the opportunity for Palantir to expand into commercial enterprise applications, this narrow-moat company is poised for robust growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. The uncovering of insights and the easy integration of data is a largely untapped market due to legacy data sets saved around the world, various data formats, the uptick in cloud-based resources, and the proliferation of the need for real-time access via distributed devices.¬†



Palantir established itself by working with the U.S. government intelligence and defense sectors to integrate military data into a consolidated dashboard, and then drove actionable outcomes by uncovering hidden patterns with artificial intelligence support. Its Gotham software platform is used across various government sectors within the U.S. and among its allies.



Palantir sells its Foundry software platform to commercial organizations, targeting large-scale data operations. Holistically combining data has typically involved consulting alongside in-house customized development efforts for enterprises; however, Palantir's commercial offering is attempting to change the industry's procurement motion. Its software is used in a variety of industries and Palantir's aim is to be the data operating system for companies and industries. By stitching together various seemingly disparate components of the airline industry, as one example, Palantir has made inroads to become a data platform standard for the industry, and looks to other industries to achieve similar results.¬†



Tldr;¬†

¬†Palantir could be the answer to the problems that governments and commercial customers face in successfully integrating large-scale, disparate data in a cohesive and coherent manner to gain insight and drive actions. Palantir has a strong government business and is diversifying into potentially higher-margin commercial markets; it could become the data operating system for companies and industries. The company has substantial margin expansion opportunities via improvements in deployment costsband by offering commercially available solutions to prospects.

this in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don‚Äôt believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.

Why does this even matter? It‚Äôs because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the ‚Äòfailure to deliver‚Äô system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more... 

Think about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It‚Äôs because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn‚Äôt sell when it went down why? Well it‚Äôs simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. 

Now back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen‚Äôs and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF‚Äôs as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that‚Äôs our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it‚Äôs a great time to be alive!

And although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won‚Äôt be able to be deductible since it‚Äôs made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it‚Äôs corruption vs the people. Unity will prevail if we stay strong together üíé

240,$AMC Cup and Handle Formation,2021-02-28 01:59:20,"So when the cup began forming, it retraced approximately 50% (which given the volatility is totally understandable).  The bottom of the cup was rather smooth, indicating a strong period of consolidation and accumulation.  The cup formation also began immediately after a new trend (the boom up), meaning it's a strong contender for a continuation of the previous trend if the cup completes.

In order for the cup to complete, the price needs to rise above the neckline, which is about $10-11 area.  If this happens, chartists and algo buyers will see the buy signal and volume should come in.

What time period are we looking at?  I'd say we have till Friday to get it to the neckline.  If enough contracts are executed Monday, we could see enough volume to get there.

There's also the issue of the gap to fill from the sell off from Feb 2.  The area ranges from $10-$15, giving us further reason for an increase in price.  If we do, the breakout in price should occur from there.

Positions: March 5 $15 calls and missionary with the HF's wife.

Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:

When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It‚Äôs for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I‚Äôll tell you fece-tossing apes.

RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself). 

$RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn‚Äôt already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November‚Äôs earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back. 

It didn‚Äôt work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here‚Äôs the thing. Rocket hasn‚Äôt used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT. 

**Shorts have to pay the dividend?**

Yes. If a stock in which you currently have a short position pays a dividend, you are responsible for the dividend on the shares you have borrowed. When the dividend is due, your broker will withdraw cash from your brokerage account equal to the amount of the dividend paid on the shorted shares.


**BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN‚ÄôT tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?**

GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I‚Äôll tell you. 

The reason Rocket hasn‚Äôt bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley AND the special dividend announcement). I assumed before the ER that they hadn‚Äôt bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner and dividend announcement is behind them, the $RKT can fire at will and is clear for take off üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November. 

Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner. Not to mention Rocket was already a popular stock among option traders but its share volume was low. This FAT dividend will motivate more investors to choose shares rather than options, which will help increase our chances of a breakout on volume. 

**BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:**

Don‚Äôt focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop‚Äôs ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to ‚Äúwait out‚Äù on this play. I‚Äôm not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who‚Äôs with me?



TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more üí¥ for more ü¶ç. More üí∞ = more üçå. Apes likey bananas üçå

247,"Insufficient, non-evidence based GME DD",2021-02-28 13:58:16,"After pouring through far more data than I really should be consuming on GME, I came to a few conclusions. I'll present my hypothesis first and let you all tear it to shreds:  


1. There won't be a squeeze until HFs are appropriately re-positioned from short to long, and won't just recover but profit. 
2. All of the (expensive) machinations witnessed thus far, such as naked shorting, trade halts, naked calls, etc. are only stalling for time allowing HFs to reposition.
3. When the squeeze happens, the narrative will be played in the press as ""retail beating wall street,"" when the reality is more like ""HFs and MMs illegally manipulated the market so they could blatantly steal money from issuing naked calls, and then after that game went stale they allowed the squeeze to make them trillionaires."" 
4. There's a chance the squeeze won't happen at all, and the HFs will continue to circle-jerk retail around, bleeding us for money on naked calls and dangling the dream of the moon in front of us. I didn't think it was possible to manipulate the price so effectively with no shares, but HFs have educated me on their antics.   


I'm evenly split on whether I actually think the squeeze will happen at this point, or whether HFs/MMs (citadelvin) will profit sufficiently from selling naked calls to keep the game alive. I don't have reliable data on how many calls Shitadel is selling per day; the best clarity I could get was this obscure figure saying that Shitadel does more volume than the NYSE. Without a Bloomberg terminal, I don't think I can find data more specific to GME calls sold daily. My estimate and my suspicion is that Shitadel is making at least enough money selling naked calls to finance melvin short selling activity, and probably more than that.   


Any newbies on this sub who invested for social justice reasons, please either buckle up or strongly re-examine your motivations for investing. You can make tons of profit in the market and do great good with your earnings. But don't fool yourself that you'll ""stick it"" to any HF who has, by now, already hedged the other side of a bad bet. If you stick with GME and win, take your earnings and make the world a better place. Or buy a Tesla. It's all the same to us, really. We're here for the sweet tendies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pattern recognition is my superpower, so it's taken me a little time to observe the process and see how things panned out. GME price didn't break out on Wednesday because of anything related to Fed liquidity, it was allowed to peak in order to drive up interest and call prices. This is the real play. Don't get played. The secondary value in allowing GME to peak is that it creates a sense of FOMO now in people who didn't sell. Even knowing this was a psychology play, I was surprised at how fast my animal brain jumped in saying ""but wait oooh shiney profits."" Do NOT underestimate how fast the paperhands FOMO will kick in when we hit $400 again. The HFs really have a handle on price manipulation, which should be illegal AF. But here we are.   


TL:DR:  Calls have turned into pump and dump and the primary profit goes to Shitadelvin. If you're new to options trading, definitely avoid."

&amp;#x200B;

Difference between Options and betting on a football game. Betting on a football game doesn‚Äôt affect the outcome. If enough people buy call options it can affect the outcome.

**Conclusion: Pro‚Äôs will BANG THE CLOSE on Thursday March 18th for April 1 Call options**

Apparently, the Pro‚Äôs are buying call option positions at the close somewhat near where the stock is trading (at the money) causing the market makers to delta hedge (estimated .66) and buy shares in the open market. For every contract (100 shares) the market makers sell at the money (near current price), they will need to hedge by buying about .66 (delta) shares on the open market. Buying pressure can increase the price sparking more interest (feedback loop).This is how the bet influences the outcome. This is the way.

The last two months they did it in the last trading week of the month. I‚Äôm thinking they could disguise their intent by executing their strategy the week before GME reports Q4 earnings. They haven‚Äôt been waiting til Friday so my guess is it would take place earlier maybe on Wednesday or Thursday. Friday the 19th is Quadruple Witching day so volatility in the overall market will be higher.

BANG THE FORUM would also fuel the rocketship. Hedge Funds are spying on the reddit forum (Point 2). They have programs to scrape every letter on this forum and calculate sentiment.  I could see them buying contracts and faking an increase in sentiment by posting the letters GME in a lot of replies so it looks like [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) are about to go gang busters on GME. If the letters GME show up in many post replies then everyone will be thinking that redditors are about to buy a lot of GME. The idiot hedge funds will go out and buy stock/options to front run the retail investor. If the [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) crowd also included ‚ÄúGME‚Äù in replies it could further fuel it as the Pro‚Äôs manipulate the market. This is the way.

[**Point 0: Movement in GME is repeatable (feedback loop)**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/25/nothing-specific-caused-gamestop-rally-says-strategist.html?&amp;qsearchterm=Nothing%20specific%20caused%20GameStop%20rally)

(click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)

Catalyst relatively simple (feedback loop)‚Ä¶.we started to tick up on Thursday and got above $50. THEN major option trades went off fueling the rocketship to the moon! Parabolic!!

2:58pm stock at $53, 750 contracts at $50 strike expire tomorrow (1 day) paid $6.85 (about $500k). Within 10 mins stock at $68 or so and not long later dropped to $60

3:27pm stock at $60.80, 400 contracts at $60 strike $7.75 (about $300k)

(Feedback loop) People on the other side of the trade (sellers of contracts) have to hedge and buy shares. Craziness will happen with only 20 minutes left to the close. All this from ONLY $800k in call option activity!! That‚Äôs nothing‚Ä¶.a little skeptical.

First Short Squeeze‚Ä¶. Last trading week of the January

Second Short Squeeze‚Ä¶. Last trading week of the February (not as many short sellers)

Projected Third Short Squeeze‚Ä¶. Last trading week of the March (huge month for trade, month and quarter end)

**Point 2: Hedge Funds spying on** [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)\*\*, use it against them\*\*

Investors (HF‚Äôs, Institutions, etc.) are paying service providers to spy on the forum and count everytime someone mentions Gamestop or the ticker. They are tracking the sentiment of the forum to front run the action. If you talk about Gamestop a lot and type in the ticker then each mention gets counted and if there is a significant increase then the HF‚Äôs may consider buying the stock and/or options to participate in any increase before it goes parabolic.

**Point 3: Q4 2020 earnings expected to be out in ‚Äúlate March‚Äù**

I expect the earnings date will be announced two weeks prior, so that puts you around March 8th Monday to March 11th Thursday. Earnings date probably between 23rd to the 25th, two weeks after the announcement of the date.

11/24/2020 (Tuesday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/08/2020 (Tuesday)

08/26/2020 (Wednesday) GME announces Q2 earnings release on 09/09/2020 (Wednesday)

05/28/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q1 earnings release on 06/09/2020 (Tuesday)

03/12/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q4 earnings release on 03/26/2019 (Thursday)

11/25/2019 (Monday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/10/2019 (Tuesday)

**Point 4: Options Cubed - GME is spring loaded for volatility**

The somewhat binary outcome of survive or die combined with a very credible activist investor (Ryan C.) is accelerated with material changes and establishing a better alignment with the secular tailwinds of gaming.

Buying call options is like an option on an option on an option, Options Cubed. For that reason, you would expect them to be priced accordingly. However, even after the first squeeze massively help by the short sellers, we sat in the $40-$60 range with out of the money call options price extremely cheap. As if they were normal options. Let‚Äôs see how cheaply someone is willing to sell a $70 call option if this stock tanks to the $50s next week.

**Point 5: Probability says buy April 1 Call options**

You don‚Äôt know when the parabolic moves will happen but the media clips above in point 2 suggest it will happen in the last week of the month. Since you don‚Äôt know when, the task is the following:

Detail Outcomes --&gt; Assign Probabilities (subjective) --&gt; Calculate Expected Value

Lets say next week GME drops to the $50-$60 range and out of the money call options are cheap like the aftermath of the first squeeze.

15x return --&gt; 10% chance of another move just simply to $100 (a $60 Strike call option would be worth about $45 to $60 with a stock price move to $100 again)

0x return --&gt; 90% chance we never get above $50 again

Expected Value = (15x \* .1) + (0x \* .9) = 1.5x return

On average a 50% return is expected. So if you think there is a greater than 10% chance of another move to $100 once it falls to the $50-$60 range then the expected return only goes up assuming you can get at least a 15x return on your contract."

Hello beautiful apes.

For those of you so smooth-brained that you've not heard of Uncle Bruce, then allow me to use my tastiest crayon to enlighten you. Stock Markets with Bruce has been a stalwart of the GME saga and the old silverback has been live streaming throughout the whole damn thing. The guy deserves all the support and praise you can give him.

Onto his DD, go to the youtube channel 'Stock Markets With Bruce' and view the video 'GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On! Stock Markets In Plain English'. I can't link it sadly.

**tldr**; Hedgefunds with short positions are buying 2x(numOfShorts) call options deep in the money to not only cover their short positions, but then end up long GME. There are more calls available than tradable stock (due to naked call contracts) and thus they can then join-in the diamond hand rocket while the Chicago Market Makers (options writers) have to scramble around trying to buy more stock than exists. All this while the newly longed HF's slowly leak shares to the MM's at ever increasing prices.

Does this mean the shorts are now coming in to bat for us? I'm more than happy for smart money to yeet this thing to the moon, I'm here for tendies, nothing more, nothing less.

If I've wrongly interpreted the DD and you've been triggered, first well done for watching Bruce's video, give him a thumbs up while you're there. Second, don't get angry at me, hate yourself for taking financial advice from an ape on the internet. P.S. If you are my wife's BF then I'm sorry... I don't know what for, I just am.

She told me that it would be a 2 hour wait b/c only a broker could do it. I told her that I had absolutely nothing better to do, since my wife's boyfriend was over tonight. In less than 10 seconds from being transferred, got a broker who took 10 minutes of reviewing my account before telling me he could have it done by Monday.  ( I guess the 2 hour remark was to get me to pass on following through with my request tonight. ) He told me he would try to make it as painless as possible and I told him I wasn't aware that there should be any pain in this process. (Awkward silence from his side then he laughed and stated that it was a poor choice of words...I'm thinking maybe a projection on his part). When asked for confirmation that process was completed, he told me he would call me personally and let me know it was done.

**Last week‚Äôs 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA 
**Last week‚Äôs losers: BIDU XPEV**

**On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD

*I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I‚Äôm playing.* 

**UPDATE: DOCU CEO** speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM. [This 300c 3/5 came through last week](https://i.imgur.com/dD2cqVp.jpg). Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. 

****

When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.

**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can‚Äôt afford it, don‚Äôt play it.** There are opportunities every day. 

Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.

****

**1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**

On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an ‚Äúinvestor day‚Äù**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.

I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.

Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**

It was time to get to work.

****

**2.	The investigation**

I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.

1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.

2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.

*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. 

*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*

These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".

****

**3.	Defining RAMBO**

As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**

I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present üò¨ üòâ.

**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I‚Äôll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**

****

**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** 

**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**

**My theory is that the current ER environment‚Äîwhere your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. 

**5. So what am I saying?**

I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.

**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I‚Äôll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**

[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.

The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.

You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.

As always pick a good entry point.

[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn‚Äôt the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright 

Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:

&gt;BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.
A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.

Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.

[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) üöÄ üò¨ 

CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.

[ZNGA](https://i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) üöÄ üò¨ 

Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)

[NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.

**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I‚Äôm a bandwagon hopper ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble

****

**TLDR**:
Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.

I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.

As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important. 

So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.

The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.

Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.

Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!

This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.

275,BABA ANT DD -China maybe first to go cashless ü•∏,2021-02-28 14:20:59,"***Translated from Chinese text *** so it‚Äôs kinda fucked up but info is here 


It was disclosed at that time that in terms of equity structure, Ant Group contributed 4 billion yuan to 50% of the shares, Nanshang Bank accounted for 15.01 percent of the shares, Cathay Pacific Shihua accounted for 10% of shares, Ningde Times accounted for 8% of shares, Qianfang Technology accounted for 7.01% of shares, and Hua Finance Industry and Yuyue Medical accounted for 4.99% of shares, respectively. Yuyue Medical, as a general funder, plans to contribute 399 million yuan with its own funds. The board of directors of Ants for the elimination of money is composed of seven directors, and the board of supervisors is composed of five supervisors, including representative supervisors of employees and shareholders' supervisors.

If the above information is true, it means that the seven major shareholders who spend money in Chongqing Ant will further increase the proportion of registered capital. Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance will carry out consumer finance-related business after its establishment. The business scope is: RMB business: (1) issuing personal consumption loans; (2) accepting deposits from domestic subsidiaries and domestic shareholders; (3) borrowing from domestic financial institutions; (4) issuing approved financial bonds; (5) domestic Interactual lending; (6) consulting and agency business related to consumer finance; (7) acting as an agent to sell insurance products related to consumer loans; (8) fixed-income securities investment business; and (9) other business approved by the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

It should be pointed out that the news that Ants were approved for fund-raising was coming out at a time when the Ant Group Sprint Science and Technology Innovation Board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange were on the market. With the suspension of the ant group's IPO last November, there has been no public progress in the news about ant's money-removing. In a report at the time last September, Financial Tiger pointed out that the approval of the establishment of Ant Fund-Ran will bring about great changes to its current consumer lending business of the group, and does not even rule out the possibility of future divestiture or business restructuring. There is also the possibility of dividing flowers and borrowing into Ant Consumer Gold in the future.

It is also analyzed that Ant Group's original consumption finance-related business is facing certain public opinion pressure. The contradiction mainly focuses on its leverage ratio and the risk of excessive concentration of business. The acquisition of money-free licenses has a significant benefit in mitigating such risks. In addition, with the implementation of the new regulations on the supervision of small lenders, Ant Group can gradually transfer some of its consumer financial business through small loan companies to consumer finance companies to enhance business compliance and sustainability.

On September 14 last year, industrial and commercial changes occurred in Chongqing Ant Shangcheng Small Loan Co., Ltd. and Hua, the main operating entities Chongqing Ant Xiaowei Micro Loan Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Ant Future Technology Co., Ltd., and the holding parent companies of the three companies are all limited shares of Zhejiang Ant Micro Financial Services Group. The division was officially changed to Ant Group. At the same time, Yu Shengfa, the legal person and chairman of the two main operating companies, withdrew and changed to Huang Hao. Hu Xi, the former legal person, executive director and general manager of Hangzhou Ant, withdrew and changed to Ni Xingjun.

With the change of the regulatory environment of financial technology, after Ant Group's IPO was suspended, there was a lot of industry attention about how its business would be reorganized. According to the previous prospectus data of Ant Group, its lending business has developed into its largest source of income. In the first half of 2020, its loan revenue increased by 59% to Rmb29 billion, accounting for 40% of the group's total revenue. Ant Financial has more than 700 million Alipay users per month, and it puts cooperation with traditional banks at the core of its strategy. In the 12 months to June 2020, its loan platform has granted credit to about 500 million people, and the annualized interest rate charged for smaller loans is about 15%. Borrowing money similar to credit cards and unsecured consumer loan products was the basis of Ant Group's plan to seek a valuation of $225 billion in the upcoming IPO.

Ant Group has been interviewed twice by regulators before. According to the content of the second interview, one of them is to improve corporate governance and strictly rectify illegal credit, insurance, financial management and other financial activities in accordance with prudential supervision requirements. Since then, news about the business reorganization and rectification of Ant Group has been circulating in the market.

In late December last year, two people directly familiar with the matter said that Ant Group was considering integrating most of its online financial business into a holding company, including the consumer loan business. In early January this year, it was reported that Ant Group was planning to restructure its consumer credit business in order to continue to lend nationwide under 
It was disclosed at that time that in terms of equity structure, Ant Group contributed 4 billion yuan to 50% of the shares, Nanshang Bank accounted for 15.01 percent of the shares, Cathay Pacific Shihua accounted for 10% of shares, Ningde Times accounted for 8% of shares, Qianfang Technology accounted for 7.01% of shares, and Hua Finance Industry and Yuyue Medical accounted for 4.99% of shares, respectively. Yuyue Medical, as a general funder, plans to contribute 399 million yuan with its own funds. The board of directors of Ants for the elimination of money is composed of seven directors, and the board of supervisors is composed of five supervisors, including representative supervisors of employees and shareholders' supervisors.

If the above information is true, it means that the seven major shareholders who spend money in Chongqing Ant will further increase the proportion of registered capital. Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance will carry out consumer finance-related business after its establishment. The business scope is: RMB business: (1) issuing personal consumption loans; (2) accepting deposits from domestic subsidiaries and domestic shareholders; (3) borrowing from domestic financial institutions; (4) issuing approved financial bonds; (5) domestic Interactual lending; (6) consulting and agency business related to consumer finance; (7) acting as an agent to sell insurance products related to consumer loans; (8) fixed-income securities investment business; and (9) other business approved by the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

It should be pointed out that the news that Ants were approved for fund-raising was coming out at a time when the Ant Group Sprint Science and Technology Innovation Board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange were on the market.

In early January this year, it was reported that Ant Group was planning to restructure its consumer credit business in order to continue to lend nationwide under new regulations, otherwise it might severely restrict Ant Group's most profitable business. This is part of an ant group's comprehensive assessment of its corporate structure. Ants hope to gradually shift their main consumer credit business to a new consumer financial sector with the power to operate nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter. In theory, switching to the consumer financial sector will enable Ant Group to continue lending nationwide without waiting for a new license plate.

Alibaba revealed in the financial report on February 2 that there was a major uncertainty about Ant Group's IPO plan, and Ant Group contributed $735 million in profits in the third quarter. Also in early February, it was reported that Ant Group planned to divest its consumer credit data business, and Ant Group became a more tightly regulated financial holding company, which was a key part of Ant Group's business restructuring. Ant Group declined to comment.

Zhang Yong, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors and CEO, said in a financial teleconference on February 3 that once Ant Group has completed the relevant regulatory procedures for approving the plan, market information will be updated in time. Financial tiger also noted at that time that when talking about Ant Group's consumer credit business, Zhang Yong pointed out that in China's retail market, payments made with flowers account for only a small proportion of the total credit amount, and the vast majority of consumers associate their payment accounts with multiple sources of funding, including credit cards. It's just one of the financing channels. Although the changing regulatory environment applicable to financial technology and Internet platform companies poses recent challenges to Alibaba, it believes that it is an important opportunity to reassess and improve business practices.

I believe that there will be an answer soon as to what plan Ant Group will restructure and where the consumer credit business will eventually go."

279,I shopped at GameStop today and it blew my mind.,2021-02-27 03:01:51,"I went into a GameStop with my girlfriend so she could buy her normal little Pokemon Knick knacks and t-shirts.... BUT.... My visit made me rethink that GameStop really is doing better than I thought.

First of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.

But seriously, I'm here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven't paid attention to their membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use their membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.

When it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What's the membership do.

It's 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.

I felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.

But the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.

Granted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but their membership program change is working.

I commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.

TLDR: felt like the new membership program was üî•, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.

283,GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market. I did some research &amp; analysis.,2021-02-27 02:44:52,"Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!

**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.

New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings

Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&amp;P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)

**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn‚Äôt suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.

**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.

**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)

**START**

I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I‚Äôve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)

If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù as many have suggested.

**PROCESS**

I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Covariance &amp; Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)

[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)

The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on ‚Äúluck‚Äù or ‚Äúchance‚Äù. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to ‚Äúluck‚Äù. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.

**So, what does this mean?**

**My opinions.**

To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.

My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.

**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**

Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.

I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much

I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".

In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.

Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.

So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.

Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.

Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!

**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.

[u\/big\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)

For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.

**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!**"

285,Endp Update,2021-03-01 00:24:10,"I posted last summer about my Endp yolo and a good amount has happened since. 

The first and biggest development is they received fda approval for the first injectable cellulite treatment, and plan on launching in March. They have yet to announce pricing, and have completely left revenue out of the guidance put out last week.

The second development is they now have an fill-to-finish agreement with Novavax for their covid vaccine. As far as we know, this for US based distribution. However, we don‚Äôt know much about this agreement, as the details are not public knowledge. Endp also left this revenue out of their guidance.

The third development is that they may not be losing exclusivity for their biggest drug vasostrict.  Endo filed a patent for a labeling update, which if approved, makes their loss of exclusivity questionable. Judging by how Teva/gsk trails are going, endp might have a chance. We will know by July.

And last but not least, we have the opioid trail. This is what it‚Äôs all about ladies and retards. The trails should be picking back up as March rolls in and these guys have zero breathing room. With the way they have structured their debt covenants, they could easily go bankrupt if they get a nasty ruling. Because of this, and the weak-ass guidance put out last week, the stock crater Friday, and to be honest it will probably continue to crater as hedgies short it into the ground. Strangely though, their bonds have been trading close to par.

So there are two scenarios come summertime. Either the stock goes titts up, or these guys go to mars.

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so I have updated to include today‚Äôs data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading üòâ

\------------

**Part 1: FINRA**

I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)

There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.

The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.

**CAVEATS:**

* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t
* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.

**Assumptions used:**

GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)

GME Total Shares: 69,750,000

The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!

**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**

Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.

The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker‚Äôs FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).

Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.

Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.

**Part 3: ETFs**

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.

They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).

&gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).‚Äù

If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).

NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF

For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""

295,I'm reposting this to hear a legit response as to why GME can squeeze when the short float is down by over 100% where it was.,2021-03-01 10:19:25,"I'm not shorting the fuckin stock. I've had shares since June at a 4.88 avg and am holding for a few years to see how they do unlike many paper handed pussies around town. 

Here's the data for GME on the short interest stats. https://imgur.com/gallery/emu2Mdp

I imagine when GME dipped to $38 shorts started unloading a decent amount. I also assume due to the ITM calls, we are still currently bullish due to the gamma squeeze that exposed market makers from being delta neutral. 

Here's my pride and joy of being one step ahead of the game: https://imgur.com/gallery/kMdnQZK

I am convinced no one can give a logic explaination as to how a short squeeze can be pulled off when we've learned how hedge funds can roll out time on their shares, deflate price, use swaps instead of shorts, etc.... And the float is 30% full. That would mean gme is still shortable by 60% of the float.  

I'm holding and hoping for a good gamma squeeze but until someone proves me wrong here, I'm convinced the short squeeze is over.

Edit: if you're down voting off of a confirmation bias, you're a shitty trader. A good trader considers all probabilities in an unbias manner. 

I'm holding longer than 90% of this sub so you can stfu and quit telling me I'm shorting. I'm not selling for years bc my avg price is 100 shares at 4.88. Simple as that."

304,Here's why I think the correction is over and we rise Monday,2021-02-27 16:07:00,"TLT has bottomed and is seemingly bouncing of the support. This will bring down the yield, thus making growth and equities attractive again

Friday we saw yields going down significantly. This only makes me convinced 1.5 on 10Y is the resistance. What made people buy bonds? I think the market correction made money flow into bonds again as it is a safe haven asset class, even on current levels. Paradoxically, we might see this movement between bonds and equities oscillate for a few more weeks violently, before it settles on a level

$1.9T stimulus is already priced in and it won't be factor affecting the current market. However, any deviation from this figure might have an impact. If it is greater than $1.9T, bonds are sold on fears of inflation, thus driving up the yield. And vice versa. A greater stimulus can also makes TLT drop below support which would be scary and not what we want.

Lastly, Fed for sure is monitoring the movement in the long dated yield. They have consistently mentioned that inflation is not an issue long term and that they still have enough tools at their disposal to control the yield curve. In case yields break off and go above 1.5 parabolically, I think they will jump in and start participating in buying the long dated bonds, which they haven't done yet - they have only been buying the short dated bonds so far.

Why would Fed want to control the long dated yield? To save the stock market? Nope. That's not their primary goal, but equities do benefit from their measure. They will buy long dated bonds because they want more borrowers in the economy than lenders. Especially given the fact their target is to boost employment, which would happen if they keep companies afloat - yes, even the zombie ones, which should ideally go out of business anyway. But that's a concern for the future. At this point, Fed is least bothered about this particular underlying problem."

https://globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.

Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce‚Äôs stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn‚Äôt worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce‚Äôs stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn‚Äôt want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.

The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no ‚Äúfair market‚Äù in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.

Saunders vs. the Shorts
Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders‚Äô corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to ‚Äúbeat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.‚Äù Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn‚Äôt go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders‚Äô bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.  
The Shorts Are Cornered
Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime opportunity,‚Äù and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders‚Äô stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn‚Äôt sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly‚Äôs outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75¬Ω, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.  
Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory
On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would ‚Äúshame the whole South.‚Äù Memphis‚Äôs newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.

In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific‚Äôs territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman‚Äôs concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill‚Äôs banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.

Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.

On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold ‚Äúshort.‚Äù When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.

Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan‚Äôs new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¬æ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.

By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.

Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.

The New York Times likened the affair to so many ‚Äúcowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.‚Äù It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street‚Äôs last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.

Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday‚Äôs news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.

At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.

VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.

The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen‚Äôs voting shares.

In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.

‚ÄúThe speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.

‚ÄúIn view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.‚Äù

Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.

Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.

‚ÄúWe vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,‚Äù a spokesman for Porsche said. ‚ÄúThe ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.‚Äù

Porsche‚Äôs statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world‚Äôs third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.

It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets ‚Äúwithout haste and without greater risk.‚Äù

Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen‚Äôs entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.

The ‚Äúmother of all short squeezes,‚Äù as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.

Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche‚Äôs holding.

‚ÄúSomeone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,‚Äù said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.

Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.

Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.

VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING?
Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.

This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.

Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.

‚ÄúThe problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,‚Äù said one Frankfurt-based analyst.

Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.

But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange‚Äôs Exchange Council, told manager magazin‚Äôs online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.

Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.

He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.

In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.

Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.

It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers ‚Äî including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.

As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL‚Äôs Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.

In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.

Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.

Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn‚Äôt actually exist.)

This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.

That‚Äôs when Falcone said something like, ‚ÄúHey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,‚Äù and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.

Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn‚Äôt happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.

The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,‚Äù said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC‚Äôs enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.

I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.

‚ÄúClients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone ‚Ä¶ manipulated the market for certain bonds ‚Ä¶ and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,‚Äù Khuzami added.

https://nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/

After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.

The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a ‚Äúpyramid scheme,‚Äù and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife‚Äôs stock falls.

But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.

Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman‚Äôs allegations that it practices a predatory business model.

The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a ‚Äúshort-squeeze,‚Äù in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they‚Äôve sold to make their bearish bets ‚Äî a move that also drives up the price.

Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.

‚ÄúThere is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,‚Äù Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.

Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don‚Äôt pose the risk of a short squeeze.

Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square‚Äôs losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital ‚Äî what he called ‚Äúmodest investment.‚Äù

Nevertheless, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to charge Ackman a premium ‚Ä¶ for the privilege of him owning a put,‚Äù Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.

Ackman‚Äôs dealer ‚Äî who sold the put option ‚Äî now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.

‚ÄúAckman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,‚Äù Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.

Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.

But that didn‚Äôt stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We‚Äôve been wrong on the share price,‚Äù Ackman told CNBC.

Herbalife‚Äôs stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife‚Äôs business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.

Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.

Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.

Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.

https://medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d

The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.

At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.

With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory ‚Äî except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.

Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.

Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‚Äòcornered‚Äô the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic ‚ÄúOnce in Golconda:
‚ÄúSince a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.‚Äù
This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem‚Äôs franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.

Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.

Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.

Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren‚Äôt ruined, merely badly burned.
Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.

Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.

From The Great Game:

‚ÄúDrew‚Äôs scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‚ÄòThe statesmen at Albany,‚Äô E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860‚Äôs, wrote at the turn of the century, ‚Äòin the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.‚Äô‚Äù

Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‚Äòbear raid‚Äô Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. ‚ÄúThey held on, hoping to see it drop to $50‚Äù

Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. ‚ÄúAsked what to do, he bellowed, ‚ÄòPut it to a thousand!‚Äô‚Äù

Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.

‚ÄúThe second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‚Äòshort of Harlem‚Äô, meant much the same thing as ‚Äòup the creek‚Äô‚Äù"

308,"Still puzzled by the buy restriction, especially the timing",2021-02-28 01:15:31,"I have no direct evidence but there are coincidence and conflict so I would like to straight it out as a reference for the once in history event.

A little background first.

* 1/13/2021 - 1/27/2021, GME price went from \~20 to \~350.
* 1/28/2021 Robinhood implemented buy restriction on GME. This restriction was fully removed on 2/5 (**Friday**). 7 trading days but 9 days include weekend. In between there were partial restriction that is almost the same as full restriction.
* During that time period, GME closed down on 1/28, but higher on 1/29 (Friday). Big drops for the next 4 days (Mon - Thur) from \~350 to \~53. The next day they fully removed the buy restriction, and the price went up to \~63. That's **Friday**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/llgbvn5cd4k61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1825434b6e2855764a7776708dd5998437860f53

I was puzzled by the timing.

* The **up trend** is still intact up to 1/29, the second day into restriction even though there was big drop the day before, when the buy restriction was implemented. If the restriction was removed then the up trend would most likely still in place, even enhanced.

1. Several other platform had restriction on 1/28 but no more the next day (Please help to verify this). Why R still has the restriction?
2. News reported that R **raised 1B on 1/29, and another 2.4B on 2/1 (Monday when another big drop happened). If there restriction was based on the capital requirement by DTCC, would this 3.4B more than enough to fulfill that requirement(&lt;1B as we now know)?** Why did they still keep that restriction? Earlier that week citadel provided 2B bailout to short seller Melvin.

* The **down trend** starting from 2/1 lasted 4 days until 2/4 Thursday. The big drop on 2/4 knocked GME from 91 to 53. At this point if it went down even more( 35 level on the left side plateau) it would likely bounce back hard from there. **The more the compress, the more the explosion power.** The restriction was **fully removed on 2/5 the next day Friday**. It was perceived as a good news but people tend to be cautious during Friday because of uncertainty of weekend. This seems to be calculated, well timed action to reduce big swing. The price had relatively small bounce back, which slowed the downward pressure but at the same time released the explosive power from the compression."
309,AMCX debacle play... or not?,2021-02-28 11:06:05,"Some of you may know that AMCX spiked on Friday. There's many that believe it was from lost Apes buying the wrong ticker. But it could have been because of the upbeat earnings call they had prior to market open.

Is anyone thinking of putting in a short or options play against this sudden spike?

Seems like an appropriate play to talk about in the bets forum because of the risk involved. If its played short because a bunch of people bought the wrong ticker then great, puts and shorts will print.

BUT... If it spiked in legit fashion from the earnings call rather than way ward Apes buying the wrong stock.... well, that's a lot of premium and buyback to gobble up the bank account.

310,Why I think GME will never go below 45$ again.,2021-02-27 12:19:42,"After the first godly squeeze in January and the artificial fall, I and I‚Äôm sure many other apes felt that we lost the fight (war or whatever you want to call it). A few weeks go by and the stock keeps falling slowly but surely which led the majority if us to believe it is a thing of the past. Many analysis and DDs and news showed that shorting went down to 60% (from over 100%) so everything seemed negative for us average rookie investors (which im sure is the majority). Keeping in mind I am now bag holding my 87% loss and thinking it is not even worth selling anymore so might as well forget it about it (diamond hands but it was very sad hands).

Moving to the present, all the ape shit that happened starting with the hearing, DFV doubling down and stock rocketing. I averaged down to 130$ from 270$, which was an easy decision for me so I‚Äôm thinking it was the same for people in my position.

I was watching the stock yesterday at 101$ and the ask was soooo not random as notmally it is because they were thousands of calls in 101.xxx which is what I guess what reddit calls a ladder attack. And the shares being borrowed and now it makes sense to me what they are doing!!! Which im sure everyone like myself with a smooth brain finally understand on some level the game!!!

So now I‚Äôm thinking since I have 5 times bigger bag at 130$ average, and other apes that did the same thing own more stocks of GME, plus we are optimistic now. As a result this means we will be holding the line stronger than the first time, so it shouldn‚Äôt go below the 45$ margin which it was at in the weeks after the first fall.

P.S. this is obviously not financial advice, and obviously you could tell I‚Äôm so bad at stock analysis and math. This is just how I am feeling right now and what my smooth brain concluded.

Anyone else feels the same way?"

I went into get tested for Covid this afternoon after being exposed, nothing special. But I'm also buying dips on AMC at the same time and as a result, almost missed my name being called multiple times by the receptionist when my turn was ready. Tunnel vision is real.

I get the swab and chat with the doc for a minute or two about all the Covid craziness and just overall life shit. He's a cool guy, super laid back and what not, and after a bit he steps out to go find my results. I'm chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I'm still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results. I didn't realize he could see the basic idea of what I was doing on my phone (price-watching etc) and as he passes me, I hear him say, ""Niiiiiice.""

Being in the exam room and awaiting my results, I chime in with, ""Oh sweet, I'm negative?"" He responds with, ""Nah, I saw the stonks on your phone. Good luck, retard."" There's a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he's here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.

Anyways, TL;DR: My doctor said ""good luck, retard"" while catching me buying dips on AMC and he's here somewhere in the WSB crowd.

322,Weekly Market Forecast - 2021-02-27 YOLO Capital,2021-02-28 02:02:31,"Hello Apes,  
This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out. 

Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!

Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.

You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?

Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.

Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!

These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.

If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.

So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.

So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.

Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!

So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.

Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?

Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red! 

Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.

All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.

This is an 87.50C that expires 26 March 2021. AMD closed at $84.51 when the mid price for this option was $3.07. Purchasing 100 shares of AMD for $8451 and selling this option for $307 costs us $8144 and caps our max gains at $606 or 7.4%. You might as well put your money in a CD or buy a treasury bond, amiright?

Now let‚Äôs run the numbers for GME ($101.74) using an option with the same expiration and similar delta. This is a 280C which had a mid price of $20.03 at close. Purchasing 100 shares of GME for $10174 and selling the 280C for $2003 costs us $8171 and caps our max profit at $19829 or 242.7%.

Here's a table for some reason.

Options quotes can be found [here](https://oic.ivolatility.com/oic_adv_options.j;jsessionid=b7t3rFfOTY9h).

# What‚Äôs the downside?

1. $19.8k is not the moon
2. $8171 is a high entry point vs buying FDs
3. Paper handing the shares before the call expires is risky unless you buy/close the call

# What‚Äôs the upside?

1. This creates upward buying pressure with less money
2. You paid $8171 for $10174 worth of shares
3. Dividends pay out 15 March

# Additional Considerations

1. GameStop‚Äôs earnings report is projected to release on 1 April but could release as early as 25 March
2. A squeeze could happen and the price could dip before your call is exercised
3. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing and I'm not recommending this as a strategy

None of this is financial advice. I just started trading stocks this week and don‚Äôt understand why the colorful lines aren‚Äôt moving on my screen today.

Thank you!",2021-02-28 18:40:58,"My brother and I were both soldiers, but he didn't make it out uninjured. He was assigned to Bagdad, and was a turret gunner in a quick response unit. On a slow day, as they were rounding a corner near a square, an IED was triggered sending the humvee into the air and catapulting him 60ft. They thought he was dead, and after securing the area realized he was alive. They flew him to Germany, then to Walter Reed, where he eventually wore up and was told he'd never walk, and that they had resected some of his lover and intestines.

After a year in a wheel chair, and working hard every day, he was able to walk again, then run. I remember him telling me he couldn't wait to get back to his unit. The Army medically retired him though, and he went into a deep depression, with which he struggled for a number of years. He eventually graduated from college with an engineering degree, but his accomplishments were overshadowed by his PTSD.

355,"While the GME rocket is preparing for launch, hedge funds are likely shorting other stocks and placing calls on GME",2021-03-01 00:10:39,"We've already seen how badly the markets did as GME suddenly did incredibly well last week. Hedge Funds and shorters of GME had to liquidate other investments in order to do their aggressive short ladder attacks on GME.

Yet with all the action around GME, and with the current state of the world, if GME does moon, many other stocks will come crashing down as shorters are forced to cover their positions.

And this is how hedge funds will win no matter what happens;

They've already set up GME to take off with how much aggressive shorting has been happening.

When the GME rocket takes off, they'll hold shorts on other stocks while holding calls on GME and make huge money off all market activity.

And while GME moons, retail traders and other hedge funds/investors that got on the GME rocket will win BIG TIME.

Yet at the same time, many of the rest of the stocks will crash and cause many to lose big time.

I wouldn't be surprised if enough insider trading is happening to have a planned date for when GME will take off so that they can time the markets perfectly and make sure as few retail traders are on the rocket as possible.

**TL:DR; It's just like the movie 2012, but hedge funds will benefit whether the world ends or not.**"
356,Big gains will only matter when you have good financial health,2021-02-28 16:42:22,"Alright fellow apes, in light of everything going on with our glorious meme stonks, we need to take some time to reflect upon our financial literacy and health. This is so that when we‚Äôre able to squeeze the big boys out of their billions, our gains will actually matter.

[It is a fact that the vast majority of lottery winners lose all their winnings, even go bankrupt, within a few years of receiving their winnings.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-the-lottery/2019/12/27/742b9662-2664-11ea-ad73-2fd294520e97_story.html)

In other words, if we don‚Äôt use our gains wisely, they‚Äôre just going to go back to the big guys that are screwing us over.

So here‚Äôs some simple yet solid financial advice from rich people that can help you keep and grow whatever gains you‚Äôll be getting within these next few months;

# 1.) Have a strict budget.

One of the most common budgets for wealthy people is this ;

**50%** of their money goes towards **necessities** (rent/board/mortgage, groceries, utilities, insurance, transportation, etc.)

**20-30%** goes into **investments**

**10-20%** goes into an **emergency fund** they can access quickly

**10%** goes towards **wants** (entertainment, restaurants, treats, etc.)

Again, not everyone can follow this budget to a T, and some don‚Äôt have to. But it will be important to budget your income and gains into these four separate categories in whichever way works best for you so that you can have strong financial health.

# 2.) Prepare for taxes

If your gains are big enough, and unless you‚Äôre going to keep them all in a tax-free account, you‚Äôre going to have to study up on what tax rates will apply to you and your gains.

For example, if you get $1.5M, and the tax rate for those sort of gains is 33%, only use the $1M and save aside the other $0.5M solely for taxes.

# 3.) If your gains are big enough, hire a financial advisor from a trusted institute

Anyone who makes huge amounts of money will be wise to hire someone that can help them understand what to do with it.

So if your gains are too overwhelming for you, and your first instincts are to instantly buy all the things you‚Äôve ever wanted, you will actually be wise to calm yourself down and do your research on who you can trust with your money.

DO NOT follow the financial advice of anyone that comes to you. YOU must go to THEM.

This leads me to my next point;

# 4.) Expect scammers, beggars, and family to come out of the woodwork if you make your gains public

There are people who dedicate their lives to manipulating others to get what they want. And if you make your wealth public by either telling everyone about your gains, or flashing your wealth around, you will become a prime target to some of the scummiest, two-faced con artists on Earth.

Even family and friends can suddenly show up and subtly ask you for money. They may not be doing this on purpose or out of sheer selfish desire; it‚Äôs just human nature.

This also leads me into my final point;

# 5.) Prepare for your entire life to change.

Your personal, relationship, and work life will all change whether you like it or not with your new big gains.

Prepare for the transition to be stressful, to challenge everything you know and are, and for you to need to re-evaluate your relationships with others as well as your purpose in life.

Again, the vast majority of people live most of their lives working hard just to get by. Now that money is less of an issue, that changes everything.

# 6.) Don‚Äôt forget that you‚Äôre still human

You are not a genius or a God now that you have this wealth. You can still bleed, and you will die just like everyone else will.

This also means that your greatest satisfaction and joys in life will not come from your wealth or the things you can now buy that most can only dream about buying.

It comes from the little things.

It comes from giving.

It comes from living in and for love.

And if you forget about it, you‚Äôll only become the very kind of people that we‚Äôre fighting against."

Or it it?

The specifics around the whole Melvin/Robinhood part is, and the new landscape of the internet making data (good or bad) more accessible to the masses will certainly be creating new rules about how the markets function. But, in the pure form of a short squeeze this is in fact a case of ""there's nothing new under the sun.""

Most have become familiar with the Volkswagen squeeze that occurred in 2008, as it has been touted as the most direct short squeeze comparison. Chart photo below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/st5n6zjngck61.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0b5f0c118efebc43b115246a09e10744c01eee1

Tesla has also been compared to the GameStop situation but that was arguably a slower burn and to be fair had been on a steady march upward leading to the explosive growth in 2020.

But there is another squeeze that occurred in 1901 that might provide a better comparison to GameStop not in terms of its cause and setup, but the potential secondary effect.

**The Great Panic of 1901**

Leading up to 1901 the Union Pacific railroad had been on an acquisition tear becoming the largest rail player in the West under the leadership of Edward Henry Herriman and backed by a syndicate that included the likes of Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Goulds, Ameses and Kuhn, Loed &amp; Co. (read as ""people who don't like to lose"").

But, in order to expand East a key acquisition had to be made. That acquisition was the Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad. However, James Hill through the backing of J.P. Morgan (also read as ""someone who doesn't like to lose""), controlled the Northern Pacific Railroad and had similar ideas for expansion.

A back and forth of bidding war for the Burlington Railway ensued which ended in Hill being chosen and Hill proposing a Burlington and Northern Pacific merger. But, Hill and Morgan did not hold outright ownership of Northern Pacific and collectively held roughly 23% interest. Believing that the $155M or so needed to gain the controlling stake in Northern was of no issue they pressed on with the Burlington merger.

Meanwhile, Harriman quietly began buying the majority of Northern's preferred shares and about $37M in common stock putting him within 40,000 common shares of control.

On May 6th, after getting tipped off of the activity, Hill and Morgan began frantically buying up common shares on the open market to block this attempt sending the share price from $110 to $130. Not wanting to announce their activity, great effort was put towards masking their buying and the general market remained unaware of the tug and war that was occurring between the two railway giants.

Believing that the price hike was artificial, traders began shorting the Northern Pacific stock.

Here is an excerpt from *The American Magazine 1907* to give an idea of the climate at the time, it carries some similarities to today:

*""It is important to understand the mood of the time. Ordinary investors had recently been worked into a frenzy as U.S. Steel shares were promoted and railroad stocks were rising fast on various rumors of insider accumulations and mergers. Lefevre recounts a ""raging public speculation in stocks"" while Clew talks of a ""restless sea of reckless stock speculation that swept the American people into its vortex, with all its razzle-dazzle extravagance.""""*

By the next day the Northern Pacific shares were up to $150 and short sellers were weighing whether to close the position and take the loss or to liquidate other holdings to remain solvent. The following day, that decision was forced upon them as the stock climbed to $200.

By this point Hill had successfully seized control, yet neither side was going to sell and jeopardize what they each believed to be the controlling stake. As the market realized there was not going to be enough share volume to close short positions the price climbed to $1000 a share. Fearing the deadline to deliver, short sellers began dumping everything to cover their Pacific Northern losses and margin rates spiked to 60% only compounding the issue.

This created a panic in the broader market and following the lead of the short sellers the entire market sold off. The short sellers lost somewhere between $40M-$70M in the mayhem but those who sold in the broader market dip got burned as well.

Overall, the total pain felt was short lived and smaller than it could have been. Realizing what was occurring Hill and Harriman reached a truce and agreed to allow positions to be closed out at $160 a share. This allowed markets to stabilize and return to previous levels, not to mention save some of the short sellers from ruin.

**How Does This Mimic Today?**

An interesting take away from this story that has some value in today's situation is first that margin played a key role in causing a broader sell off and second that the stabilization came from two whales calling a cease fire.

Today margin is at a record level, almost at the COMBINED amounts leading up to the internet and housing bubbles, even after adjusting for inflation.

Some data on these levels further down in the post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueSqueeze/comments/lpftk7/investor_gardening_101_know_when_its_time_to/)

So, should the GameStop situation run away to a sufficient level, we can expect the incentive to sell due to margin will work its magic. Kind of like dry wood building up in a forest waiting for a fire.

A bit of an instance of ""correlation does not equal causation,"" but it seems that when GameStop goes up the broader market does tend to sell off.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wb2hq9pqgck61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a603988fe3cad8c2ddc2e03ad205f3de2b1b83f4

Some statistical data I've seen from various sources keeps landing at about a -0.50 correlation to the indices with a T-stat of &lt; 0.05, which means a low likelihood of random chance correlation.

Eh, maybe a stretch but I bet the inverse correlation gets stronger as GameStop goes from $200 to $400 to $800 etc.

*Now for the scary part,* in the above example two whales met in the middle to call an end to all of the madness. I suspect there will be no such ""bailout"" in today's case. A quick review of the sentiment around the GameStop revolution shows that convincing a diverse population of shareholders who see this as more of a crusade rather than merely a profit endeavor is going to be an uphill battle should the price keep rising.

And good on them, but should 1901 repeat itself the SEC may have to force some hands. We've already seen brokers take matters into their own hands.

**How Not to Burn Your Hands and Maybe Get a Chance to Profit**

If you are profit motivated, you could of course try and time an entry into GameStop if you expect the squeeze has not happened and that the best is yet to come.

But, assuming the above is a good proxy for what could happen, might that be the best way to approach the situation?

If you are on board for the revolution by all means take what money you can afford to lose and join the cause. But, for those dollars above and beyond this amount, the ones you have to make calculated bets with, can some second order thinking provide fantastic risk adjusted returns?

**The easy way** would be to mimic what a certain Bernard Baruch (a trader on the floor at the time) did in 1901. A quote from him during the panic:

*""On the Exchange floor fear had completely taken the place of reason. Stocks were being dumped wildly, dropping from ten to twenty points. There were rumors of corners in other stocks \[in addition to Northern\].""*

Baruch realized what was going on and he bought heavily in the drop. He knew great companies were being sold at fire sale prices and he took full advantage.

To follow his lead in today's situation would be to have some DD already done on companies you'd love to own, make sure the cash is available and see if some fireworks happen.

**The hard way** would be to actually put on a short. Which does not have to be done *prior* to some positive movement from GameStop. But ask yourself, in a selloff situation what is likely to happen?

Most probable would be a flight to safety. So, if you are a trader, going short growth companies as GameStop makes some serious moves upward may be the safest short equity bet. Historically speaking people are most eager to let go of those companies that have yet to grow into their multiples (think high P/E ratios).

Regardless of the method that works best for you, which of course depends on existing positions, risk tolerance, etc. the current situation has the potential to create a low risk high reward outcomes as a secondary effect. We already have a historical data point to look to and the dry tinder waiting behind that one was a fraction of what we have today.

Some thought put towards a response to this possible outcome may prove to be profitable. And for those solely seeing this as a movement, that secondary effect would still mostly be at the expense of the institutions.

Food for thought."
361,REMEMBER - Fidelity loaning out your shares to shorts if you're on a MARGIN account,2021-03-01 05:10:26,"I noticed a bunch of tards posting bullshit here in wsb saying that you can just leave your Fidelity account on MARGIN as long as you have CASH to buy your shares/options.

Yeah, true... except it defeats the fucking purpose because shorts will be borrowing your share as long as you remain on a MARGIN account. You need to call and transfer all your stocks to a cash account and then your shares will be recalled automatically from the shorts i.e. melvin and citadel and other fucks.

**TLDR; don't listen to retards and change your Fidelity account from Margin to CASH NOW before they loan out your shares to shorts you fucks**

I‚Äôve been watching people recently scream *100K IS NOT A MEME* into the void over and over again, so I decided to break out of my lurker shell for those of us wondering if 100k is actually a meme, aren‚Äôt sure where to set the sell limit, and are afraid they are going to miss the train to tendie town.

Go take a look. *EVERYBODY!*

I‚Äôve pulled numbers from the chart, I know they don‚Äôt line up with the values from 2008 (stock split maybe?) but they are accurate when used relative to one another.

Here we go.

October 2nd: $263

October 3rd: $277

October 6th: $292

October 7th: $287

October 8th: $294

October 9th: $296

October 10th: $342

October 13th: $353

October 14th: $352

October 15th: $390

October 16th: $398 (High $428, Low $382) --&gt; **NOT THE SQUEEZE**

October 17th: $358

October 20th: $277

October 21st: $242

October 22nd: $243

October 23rd: $229

October 24th: $210

October 27th: $520 (High $635, Low $324) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 28th: $500 (High $500, Low $471) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 29th: $517 (High $607, Low $491) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 30th: $500 (High $590, Low $485) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

October 31st: $499 (High $548, Low $472) --&gt; **SQUEEZE**

The stock then trades around $400 for almost another 2 weeks before starting to make its way back down towards pre-squeeze levels.

*BEFORE THE SQUEEZE*, the price ramps up to a peak on October 16th of $428, before crashing down over the next 6 days back to a low of $210.85 on October 24th, at which point the squeeze squozes. Once squozen, it squozes for **5 DAYS**. If the price rises and crashes fast, it *wasn‚Äôt* the squeeze.

*Please!* Put away your fears that you are going to miss the squeeze. If we get to the true squeeze, you‚Äôll have time to take a nap and still not miss it. Even if you went on vacation for a week perfectly around the Volkswagen squeeze, you‚Äôd still have almost 2 weeks to sell at ~80% of the squeeze average.

Is 100k a meme? I have no idea - but it *doesn‚Äôt matter*. The BEST way for us to get the HIGHEST price is to completely delete your sell limits, and wait for the squeeze to squoze. That way we all get the best price, and we don‚Äôt risk scrubbing the launch before take off. In addition, the HFs can see your sell limits, and will use whatever information they can against us. Just delete them.

Absolute worst case scenario is that you‚Äôre in a coma for the squeeze, and Papa Cohen drives you all the way to tendie town.

Now, (looks around) where is that lurker shell I crawled out of.

**TLDR**: The train to tendie town doesn‚Äôt just fly by and force you to jump off a moving train. The train **STOPS** at tendie town for a vacation. The best way to get the highest price is to delete your sell limits and wait for the squeeze to squoze.

A simple Reason why I think we should all go in AMC without nearly any cares about losses and hold it. 

The Value is very low now and we all know what's going on this time so we have a very huge chance to make a huge amount of money and even if this gamma squeeze won't happen in near future we will win or at least go out without losses.

AMC has many Cinemas around the globe and everyone loves going to the cinema. After the Covid-bullshit when they can open again with full capacity, the company can earn money again and has a good chance to grow again in long term and we all can take our money back. Maybe one month, maybe one year, who knows. 

And please remember the rumors about the corporations with Amazon and Netflix. 

That's why I use every penny I can get to buy and hold AMC until we reach the Andromeda Galaxy. 

But that's NOW. If Monday everybody starts to think like this and buy before the price reaches unrealistic dimensions to get it back, it can be a little more struggle psychologically. 

I will use the low price at this time to build out my position and enjoy this ride into the core of singularity like I've seen in the Interstellar movie.

If you haven't already, you should read it.

Linked here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)

Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and before RKT got the earnings boost, valued at MORE than üöÄüöÄüöÄ, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's another little DD summary I found:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx\_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAbx_2fOHNMy2MvLW3CFEhJDRUJGr69coTVSV3A6ip4/edit)

&amp;#x200B;

If you were too lazy to read either of those, know that RKT has 40% short interest. 40 PERCENT. THE SHORT BORROWING FEE IS 80%

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT](https://fintel.io/ss/us/RKT)

&amp;#x200B;

This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by Friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.

&amp;#x200B;

YES. YOU READ THAT RIGHT. üö®üö® 5 DAYS UNTIL THEY HAVE TO COVER OR COUGH UP THE DIVIDEND

üö®üö® THIS IS NOT A DRILL. WE HAVE AN ACTUAL SHORT EXPIRATION DATE üö®üö®

&amp;#x200B;

To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.

This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's also targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.

I'd link the interview, but reddit won't let me for a DD post.

TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY üö®FRIDAYüö® and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK. Retail/WSB buying pressure on RKT would üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ it to the ABSOLUTE üåïüåïüåï.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally imagine an epic runup until Friday, which could then also pop a gamma squeeze while we're at it.

&amp;#x200B;

The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.

Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 109, $35 C 1/21/2022 x5.

I will personally be buying any dips that occur if I find an exit opportunity for my other positions. Maybe do some averaging up üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Not financial advice üöÄüöÄüöÄ

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: If you're confused about why 3/5 when the ex-dividend date is 3/9, here is a source to my claim that because of T+2 settlement you must own by Friday.

[https://finance.zacks.com/settlement-date-occur-before-exdividend-date-receive-dividend-6289.html](https://finance.zacks.com/settlement-date-occur-before-exdividend-date-receive-dividend-6289.html)

Ex-Dividend Date

One factor complicating the discussion of the dividend date is settlement. When you purchase a stock, it takes three business days for ownership to be transferred. This transfer of ownership is referred to as settlement. Therefore, you have to purchase the stock at least three business days before the record date to receive a dividend. Assume the record date is June 4. If you buy the stock on June 1, you will own it on June 4 and be entitled to receive a dividend. However, if you buy it on Tuesday or later, ownership transfer will occur after the record date and you will not be paid a dividend. June 2 is therefore referred to as the ex-dividend date; in other words, the first day on which buyers will no longer be entitled to a dividend."

However, I only went to march 19th as I naively assumed that there was not enough open interest to significantly affect their exposure.

I was wrong.

Their exposure is over **25 million shares.**

This can only mean two things: They own millions of shares AND calls, or they **ARE NOT DELTA NEUTRAL.**

Market Makers MUST be delta neutral in their position, which means even at the low price of 101$, they must own massive amounts of shares and calls or they must purchase them. This implies that Market Makers are walking the tight line of causing a massive gamma squeeze the likes of which we have never seen, or **half the float is locked up to hedge.**

If they use calls to hedge, they will dig their own grave as it will push the price higher as other market makers need to start covering massive amounts of ITM calls. **This means that if they bought ITM calls to hedge, it will accelerate the gamma squeeze.**

So, what should they do? Do they **buy 25m shares?** or do they buy massive amounts of call options (we are talking in excess of 250k calls) and **accelerate the gamma squeeze?**

I personally only see two outcomes, one as the stock rises it will become more and more volatile as shares get locked up to hedge, or we are the cusp of seeing a massive gamma squeeze. **Both outcomes will exasperate the short squeeze.**

373,"GME, Comparing Volume (Options, Equity) and Closing Price For the Past 4 Months",2021-03-01 07:02:45,"Apes,

I am seeing a lot of posts/videos in regards to predicting the date of the squeeze.  
As much as I enjoy solid DD as the next guy, I must draw the line somewhere and provide a healthy dose of skepticism.  
First off, fuck *most* of these YouTube clout chasers who are doing nothing but spreading false hope and bad information. Cucks like that data scientist, Meet Kevin and the rest don't know jack shit. Unless they show a sizeable position in GME, their words hold zero weight.

DFV backed up his words with actions.  
Credibility should be earned, not given.

**I pulled some data from the following sources below:**

1. Options Volume Source:  [https://www.cboe.com/us/options/market\_statistics/historical\_data/](https://www.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/historical_data/) 
2. Daily Volume / Closing Price:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1601510400&amp;period2=1614470400&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1601510400&amp;period2=1614470400&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d&amp;includeAdjustedClose=true) 

It appears to me there's a common sentiment that the week with the highest options volume is the week of the squeeze.

***See the chart I created below***  


https://preview.redd.it/5wg5929v3dk61.png?width=1305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c479e688b1d7dc892d0cb47af6a69dfff052c600

**What this chart tells us, is that the second to last week of JAN had the highest options volume.**  
**It was the subsequent week where the real squeeze should've occurred** (*if not for RH/SEC/DTCC/Citadel/etc...*)

I understand the ETF re-balancing for XRT also occurs MAR-19, *joined* with the heavy options volume could potentially be all that's needed to start the squeeze.  
However, it is still my belief that the squeeze will occur once the shorts have hit their regulatory leverage limit and SEC RULE 204 comes into play.  
[https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)  


The options volume is one factor, but I don't think it should be the main or determining one.  
I wouldn't put too much weight on this variable, please feel free to disagree and provide logical rebuttals in the comments.

For anyone that doubts my credibility, feel free to dig through my past posts.  
I still have a large position in GME and will hold until the end of time.  


***TL;DR***   
1. If you truly subscribe to the notion that you can predict a date for the squeeze, put your money where your mouth is and post some YOLO 3/19 GME calls. 

2. Options volume shouldn't be the main variable in predicting the squeeze in my opinion."

378,AMC,2021-02-28 20:36:14,"This is not financial advice**
AMC as we all know closed about the $8 mark on Friday the 26th (closed at $8.01). Because of this, over 18,000 call options were able to be executed due to the fact they were in the money. This means that 1,800,000 shares of AMC will be purchased as a result. On Friday, we also saw a call option volume of over 300,000 contracts meaning that hedge funds/sellers of these contracts will need to buy 100 shares per contract in order to hedge the position. This is how a gamma squeeze is formed. Through the massive amount of buys for this particular share. 

On top of this AMC is one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market with a short interest similar to GameStop‚Äôs. It is also one of the most active stocks in terms of daily volume. With that said, AMC had potential to form a short squeeze on top of the gamma squeeze that is going to occur this upcoming week. This has the potential to his not $10, $20, $30 per share but above $100 per share if we all hold our shares. There will be information put out to scare us into selling. There will be ladder attacks to bring the price down. But all we have to do is hold. 

Holding this stock will force hedge funds and those shorting the stock to buy at whatever price we are willing to sell for. If we all hold we win. There are now over 9 million members of this group and we all feel as though we have been wronged by actions on Wall Street and the constant manipulation of prices. But this time we will win. We hold we win it is really that simple. Let‚Äôs make history together."

In every downturn there is (at least) one thing that has always done well, and that's film. Why? Well, in my opinion, it's because going to the movies is a relatively cheap luxury. In 2000 and 2009, people didn't stop going to the movies. AMC, for example, saw a 4% annual drop in 2008 (April-March), but bounced back up in 2009 (April-March), and there weren't very many industries which only saw a 4% drop. People who could afford $350 Blue Man Group tickets in January 2008, may not have been able to afford those tickets a year later, but they could sure afford $10 in June 2009 to go see Transformers. Cinemark (Regal) didn't even see a 08-09 dip.

Box office revenue in 2019 was $11.4bn, and it dropped 80% to $2.28bn in 2020, because this downturn is different, it's not about people not having money, it's about us not being able to be closer to each other. 

Enter vaccines. I don't know when going to the movies will feel normal again, but eventually it will, and my guess is it will be sometime before the end of 2021. Now, there's a lot of big talk about what people are gonna do as soon as they're vaccinated: trips to Bali, trips to Majorca, licking doorknobs... But who really has the funds to blow on these trips or enough doorknobs to make it worth their time? Maybe some of you gain-porn assholes on wsb (just jealous), but for everyone else who got laid off, fired or is just still struggling to survive at $40k/year, where are they gonna go? To the fucking movies, and after the last year, we're all gonna be like idiots packing into Valhalla to breathe in other people's sneezes and eat popcorn that's had 10 different hands in it.

There's a good chance that I'll be totally wrong, but I think 2022 is going to be the biggest box office year on record and AMC is the biggest player. All they have to do is hang on a little longer, and they'll slay. With that being said, the stock market is a ponzi scheme where stock price can be manipulated and is rarely linked to actual performance (see: $AMC pre-2020), but I think people are going to be thinking about and excited about going back to the movies, which will push up the value.

To those who might be thinking: but with so many streaming options, who's going to go to the movies anymore?!? I don't care how big your tv is, or how great your sound bar sounds, it's not the same as going to the movies. I don't remember very many films I watched at home as a child, but I sure as shit remember going to opening night of Batman (Keaton) with my parents, because it was an experience... The excitement, the anticipation, the murmur as the lights dim, the fun of a communal response to jump scares... You all remember being around people right? Watching movies at home is fun, but it's just not the same as a night out at the movies and a family of four can do it for ~$60. Right now, I'd pay $60 to go to the movies by myself just to feel alive again.

Anyways, you all do what you want. I'm long on $GME and I'm long on $AMC. They might pop in the next month, but I think they're gonna go up and stay up in the long run (and I'm more bullish on AMC's long term prospects than GME, until I see a new strategy). I'm not buying for the pop, I'm buying for them gainz. How many people wish they would have held their Amazon, Apple or Tesla stock beyond the pops? I'm saying this next part as much for myself as for any other ape: quit obsessing over the ticker and get back to work so you can earn more money to buy more shares... If I like the stock today (I like the stock), I'm still gonna like it next month. And remember the old saying: what one ape can do, so too can another.

Good luck everyone. Try to relax this week.

385,GME IS A MEME STOCK,2021-02-28 09:51:26,"I‚Äôve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I‚Äôm just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...

Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING

Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn‚Äôt matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. 

Longer version:

There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. 

GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It‚Äôs abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn‚Äôt matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. 

GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it‚Äôs why we can do this. You don‚Äôt need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn‚Äôt new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won‚Äôt lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. 


Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don‚Äôt remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. 

I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It‚Äôs what hedge funds are doing. It‚Äôs all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. 

Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don‚Äôt look for a made up catalyst. It‚Äôs right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. 

I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God‚Äôs work (not religious just an expression). I‚Äôll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). 

This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that‚Äôs interpretation. 

I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!

I hope all newcomers see this...

Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how ‚ÄúGameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that‚Äôs why shorties keep coming back to ‚Äòsqueeze‚Äô‚Äù but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!

Whenever you are confused and dissuaded by all the misinformation, come back here or speak my name. I‚Äôll be there to put you back on the right path."

388,AMC Gamma Squeeze,2021-02-28 23:25:07,"As a disclaimer, I did not partake in the initial AMC or GME or any meme stock rally from January, and I am not bagholding any positions from that rally. I bought into AMC 3/12 15Cs on Thursday and Friday because of what I noticed.

First we'll start with a brief description of what a gamma squeeze is. Long story short, all it is is there are a lot of calls that were bought, and those call options are ITM and are either expiring and/or being exercised, which forces the stock price to go higher as options writers now need to cover their position. [https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze](https://www.nestegg.com.au/invest-money/stock-market/what-is-a-gamma-squeeze) is an article that explains it in depth.

On Thursday 2/25, from about 2:23PM EST to 2:40PM EST, I saw a HUGE influx of AMC call options being bought, nearly $5.6M worth of call options, the total number of contracts bought was 22,740 contracts, were bought in a 17 minute time frame. I had never seen such activity in my life. This is where things get interesting. 15,539 out of the 22,740 total options were AMC 2/26 6.5Cs. The remaining 7,201 contracts were AMC 2/26 7Cs. 

Here is a breakdown of the orders:

**AMC 2/26 6.5C**

Total Premium Paid: $3,971,000

Total Size: 15,539 contracts

Right to purchase: 1,553,900 shares @ 6.5 per share for a total cost of $10,100,350

**AMC 2/26 7C**

Total Premium Paid: $1,582,000

Total Size: 7,201 contracts

Right to purchase: 720,100 shares @ 7 per share for a total cost of $5,040,700 

Immediately I thought that AMC was going to have an EOD rally and that these weeklies would print insane and that's why they came in with such volume in such a small time frame, but I was wrong, there wasn't any EOD rally. This kinda shocked me, because who would buy millions of dollars worth of weeklies in such a manner if it wasn't for a day trade? But then it hit me, these were all very ITM calls, and ALL these orders came in as **split orders**. For those who don't know what a split order is, it is a type of order for large securities transactions that is divided into smaller orders and it is done to prevent large fluctuations in the market price. [https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:\~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security](https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/split+order#:~:text=An%20order%20to%20buy%20or,order%20varies%20according%20to%20security). is article if you are interested in learning more about split orders. This is when it hit me, holy shit, these calls HAD to be bought to be exercised!! Why in the world would there be such large buyers, within such a small time frame, buy so many ITM weekly calls, \*and the cherry on top\* as split orders just to stop the market price from fluctuating then and there? GAMMA SQUEEZE THAT'S WHY.

And this is where I wrap this up folks. AMC is still one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the market, and AMC still has been extremely active in terms of share volume on a daily basis. On top of that, NYC movie theaters open up again next month too, which is fundamentally great for AMC. AMC had very heavy call buying for the 6.5Cs and 7Cs all week, with more volume being concentrated in the 6.5Cs, and AMC closed well above this on Friday (AMC closed at 8.20 to be exact). Those calls were most likely bought to be exercised, so many shorts have to cover or did already cover. This should propel AMC stock price this week, hopefully forcing an insane gamma squeeze.

**TLDR:** On 2/25 big boys bought a crap ton, millions of dollars worth, of AMC 6.5 and 7 weekly calls in literally 17 minutes via split orders, and these calls were likely to be exercised. AMC closed well above 6.5, where most of the call volume was, and because they expired ITM those contracts will be exercised and a crap ton of shares was bought squeezing those option writers and forcing them to cover, in such a manner that we should see an epic gamma squeeze this week."
389,Market Cap explained for new Apes,2021-03-01 11:21:06,"There's been a bit of FUD thrown around saying that GME won't hit 100k because the market cap will be too big etc, so here's a really simple explanation as to what market cap actually is and what it is used for..

Market Cap is the last traded price multiplied by the amount of shares in existence.

So if a company issues 1 million shares, and the share price trades at $10, the market cap is $10 million. This does not mean that the company is worth $10 million. nor does it mean that $10 million has been invested in the company.

All market cap is useful for is to rank companies against each other.

Another way to look at it..

I could create my own cryptocurrency, and issue 1 million units. I then sell 1 unit to my wife's boyfriend for $10, and all of a sudden the market cap is $10 million. Only $10 has traded hands yet it has a gigantic market cap.

So I hope you can all see now that market cap means nothing really. It's only use is to compare and rank. It has no impact on our ability to hit $100k and beyond."

395,A quick reasonable and logic explanation on what is currently happening to GME,2021-03-01 00:08:28,"Hi guys,

all the following informations are out of uncle bruce latest youtube video. I can't post a link in here as the automod directly deletes the post but just search for ""GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On!"" if you are interested in the 17 minutes original video I got my informations from.

I'm just quickly recapping everything he says for those of you that are too lazy or retarded to watch the video. **TLDR and theoretical outlook at the bottom.**

Fictional example:

Hedgefund A shorted 1 Million shares at 120$ which means he sold 1M shares at 120$. The price goes down to 100$. In order to close the short position he has to buy back the 1M shares and return them to his MM. His profit is the difference between 120$ and 100$ times 1M: 20M $. In theory this sounds pretty simple but buying back 1M shares in a tightly packed and balanced buyers/sellers market causes a huge overhang in favor of the buyer side. More buyers then sellers = stonk goes up. By the time you bought 400.000 individual shares back, the price has gone back up to 125$ because people notice there is a huge whale buying a lot of shares. If you would keep on buying back all your shares until you reached your 1M shares to close your short position you have driven the price up to 135$ (just an example). Your average price is somewhere around 125-130 $ (again just a guess don't nail me on this one). The whole maneuver now costs you around 5-10M $ because your average buy back price is higher then your original short position. **You can't do that because your short position is so large that closing it would require you to buy so many shares that the stock goes above your short entry point which makes the deal nonsense.**

What you do instead: you go to the chicago option exchange and you get 20.000 ITM calls @, for example; 60$ which expire tonight. Normally such amounts of calls aren't exercised because most of the people don't exercise their shares because they don't have the money to do so but you are a massive HF you shit millions a month. As those calls aren't properly hedged because everyone is greedy and nobody thought that this meme-stock would actually rise again, the option MM now has to deliver 2M shares to HF A. They might have a quarter of those 2M but they still have to buy 1,5M back from the market. HF A uses 1M shares to close his short position and with the other 1 M he goes long because he somehow knows that the option guys fucked up OR because he knows that other shorters are doing the same. HF B, C, D also get a a lot of calls to close their short positions at whatever price. Suddenly there are a lot of calls getting exercised. Many option MM have to buy back shares at the market. HF A waits for the option MM to buy all the shares for their calls which drives up the price. Option MM then deliver the 2M shares. HF A closes his short position and sells the other million of shares while price is going up to 170-200 because other option MM are keeping the buying power coming. They closed their short position and made additional bucks through their newly gained long position.

Many people in here are assuming that most of the options get hedged but this doesn't seem to be the case. Otherwise there wouldn't be such a huge buying power of the last days. There was a huge 240M share volume in two days. There are big institutional players involved which are trying to buy million of shares or in other words: NAKED call options that get exercised in large quantities. There are several hundred thousand of options in between the 60-100 price range. As the stock went down throughout the last month there were dozens of million shares shorted at some point. All those short positions have to be covered at some point in order to make profit out of them. This big buying wave might just been a first wave of option makers trying to cover the call options that are used by HF to cover their short positions that were created throughout the whole month of february and in the end of january. This buying frenzy from option makers caused other options to be in ITM which were bought by HF just on the day of their expiry which allows them to close more previous short positions.

**TLDR for TLDR as requested:**
Option makers fucked up through naked/badly hedged calls that are now ITM and used by HF to cover their profitable short positions. 

**TLDR:** Insanely high amounts of mostly naked or badly hedged call options are exercised because HFs are trying to close their short positions that are several million shares huge, without driving up the price through creating a buyer overhang. OR in other words: the HFs are handing over the bag to the chicago option makers which now have to deliver million of exercised call options at a huge price range that they never thought of actually being exercised in those quantities.

**Outlook:** as I understood bruce right - this process isn't over yet. Many call options expired at the end of friday and if several ten thousand call options are naked or badly hedged then this would cause the options MM to buy even more shares. As the price went up to 100$ - there are a lot of call options ITM now, that weren't previously in the money. If the options MM didn't prepared correctly in advance then this thing could go to the outer rims of our galaxy. There were so much shares shorted while the price came back down from its highs at the end of january but all those shares have to be returned on day and you can only return back those shares through calls because otherwise the price would go back up. As I said - the bags just got passed on. If dozen of million of shares are shorted throughout a whole month where the price goes down to 40$ then all those short positions still have to be closed. On paper those million big short positions made hundred millions of dollars but buying back dozens of million shares creates such a huge buyer overhang that someone has to pay the price for those millions of shares being shorted. From my understanding. If you buy a option then you are making a bet with someone else. Your counterpart is the option MMs in chicago. Through buying a call at 60 dollars you are betting that the price of the stock is higher as 60 dollars at the expiry date. If the price makes it up higher than 60$ you won and the option MM lost the bet and needs to pay for his losses. Through complex hedging they are reducing their losses and on a total sum they still make a lot of money because they act as a big institution and not as a individual that either looses or wins his bet. If another big institution steps up and outplays you then you still have to pay those huge losses as this is part of the casino. Sometimes there is a person winning at the roulette table making 1M $ at night but several other thousand people lost 10M $ at the other table but what if 20 guys win 1M $ in one night. You still have to pay them. The losses of the chicago option exchange is our gains and profit because in the end we retail guys are just a small fish that is snacking off the still decent leftover tendies that were available through 2 big sharks fighting against each other.

397,The squeeze is going to be way bigger than before.,2021-02-28 11:26:33,"
1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren‚Äôt even covering at the time.
2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that‚Äôs 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies)
3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to &lt;100
TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain‚Äôt finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65. 
In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn‚Äôt have gotten buttfucked to begin with.

399,BB - a long and factual look at Chen's hints and predictions during earnings calls,2021-02-28 19:01:04,"It's weekend, going outside is illegal, and I'm bored. I started my own DD into BB by looking up the most relevant recent information. If y'all don't feel like reading through the earnings calls transcripts, etc, I've put together a little summary. :) Figured I might as well post it here - if only for my personal records/safekeeping. (Automod deletes posts with links to certain sites, so you'll have to seek out the earnings transcripts yourselves, unfortunately.) Enjoy.

 

**Blackberry Q2 earnings transcript, 9/24/20.** 

 Most interesting (to me) takeaways: they're lobbying the US and Canadian governments to get more contracts; approaching other governments as well; trying to work with individual states, though pricing is an issue there. Chen recognizes that his sales people suck - that structure is being changed.

 

**December 2020:**

The AWS deal is already priced in: the 50% spike in December 2020. Bullish articles from analysts: what if it partners up with Tesla as well?

&amp;#x200B;

**Blackberry Q3 earnings transcript, 12/17/20:** 

Added a lot of federal government clients as well as the Bank of India and the Government of Rwanda. (How random is that?)

BB's AtHoc (secure communication) now owns the entire state of California.

Referring to the AWS partnership announcement: ""Combined, we‚Äôre able to provide a full end-to-end platform."" Hmmmm, this is probably just wishful thinking, but Amazon loves owning end-to-end stuff... I don't think they'll buy BB, but the potential is always there - just like they bought Goodreads, [Diapers.com](https://diapers.com/), etc.

BB's goal for integration in an actual car is 2023: until then, it'll remain in development. We won't see any subscription revenue this year or next, but there might be interesting announcements on more automakers partnering up with BB.

Annual Recurring Revenue is decreasing for the second quarter in a row. They expect it to go up when the covid mess gets better, meaning Q1-ish. Implication: it'll still suck in Q4.

Partnerships with Zoom, Verizon, and Microsoft.

Curious: papa Chen specified that his sales folks are using the SolarWinds hack (which didn't affect BB) as a big selling point. (Should we expect more sales revenue in Q4, then?..)

IVY beta version should be ready in September 2021. The developer version should be ready in mid-2021.

They're wooing 20 different electric vehicle manufacturers. Once they sign up, public announcements will follow if the manufacturers are fine with that.

Papa Chen name-drops Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS - and the upcoming CEO of Amazon later in 2021. Says ""He specifically spent quite a bit of time on how this particular -- this relationship. So you can see that they are very serious. This seriousness not only come from the cloud side, but it comes from the IoT side also at Amazon.""

The IVY revenue will be split with AWS.

 

**January 2021:**

The catalyst for the spike to $20 was the news about the Facebook settlement. However, none of the details of the settlement were disclosed. (Articles don't mention WSB as the catalyst. Heh.)

&amp;#x200B;

**My thoughts:**

1. The Facebook settlement news is interesting... That alone was enough to spike the price, which has since fallen by \~50%. Once the details are announced (on the 3/31 earnings call?), that alone might drive another price spike depending on how much money BB is getting.
2. Q4 earnings won't be announced until late March (3/31?). Sounds like they made a lot of new sales in Q4 by pointing out that the SolarWinds hack didn't affect them.

2a. More government contracts based on how badly the hack affected them?

3. Papa Chen might make new announcements about new electric vehicle partnerships at any time. I suspect if there will be big announcements, they will come before the earnings call, just like the AWS news dropped before the late-December call.

4. IVY developer version will drop in mid-2021. That might generate some headlines at long last.

5. This is the big one. Andy Jassy will take over Amazon from Jeff Bezos in Q3. Jassy is on record as a fan of Blackberry. That is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge. Read the Q3 earnings transcript: papa Chen and Jassy have a bromance. Unlike all the other developments, I don't think we'll have to wait for years and years until we start getting some interesting headlines from the AWS/BB team-up.

6. Papa Chen has not given any interviews at all in 2021. As far as I can tell, he hasn't made any public comments at all about the spike and the crash of his stock. Interesting. The guy is smart and he knows when to keep his mouth shut.

7. The Facebook settlement. The giant gorilla in the room. We still don't know how much money we're talking about here. That was one of the key things (aside from WSB haha) that spiked the stock in January. That's still a huge wildcard. The settlement's details will most likely be revealed either before the earnings call (mid-March?) or during the call. I don't think it's baked into the current stock price because right now BB is trading at pre-Facebook-announcement levels. Once the news is announced, it could be nothing, or it could drive another huge spike in price. And if that announcement is combined with some other good news... Well, I hope the guys that short BB will have enough to cover. :)

**tl;dr** \- BB has **a ton** of potential. I've been averaging down and holding because I like the stock. I'm not an advisor, this isn't for educational purposes, this is purely for entertainment.

403,GMEs inverse correlation with the market,2021-02-28 15:07:16,"So I have recently been doing a lot of research on recessions, and it‚Äôs hard to deny that it looks like we might be sitting on the brink of one. I recently watched a video by Jake Tran regarding the striking similarities between the Great Depression and today. Rock bottom interest rates on the rise, the average debt of individual Americans, the number of retail investors involved in the market (which also correlates with Germany‚Äôs hyper inflation in the WW1-2 era as suggested by Michael Burry), and the fact that wealth inequality is at an all time high since the days right before the Great Depression. It seems to me at least that we are looming over some treacherous waters.

How does that correlate with GME? 

Well, as we have seen, anytime there is an increase in GME there is a corresponding decrease in the rest of the market. Whether that be from hedge funds liquidating other stock to fight the GME war or the general fear of investors of the implications that come with GME. It has now happened both with the January and February rises and is not a coincidence. The markets fell by as much as 3% in a single day when GME was on the rise. 

Now, there has been some talk of a gamma squeeze still in the making. I‚Äôm not sure about it, but some Redditors are putting the date as March 19th, or at least in the weeks surrounding March 19th. How accurate is that? IDK you apes can go find the DD yourself, but it certainly seems a distinct possibility. If it does occur though, and it squeezes into the thousands or even tens of thousands, the resulting impact on the market will be tremendous. And given the delicate situation the market is in, could very well trigger a recession. 

Now what I find interesting is what happens in a recession, theoretically pinpointed on March 19th. Whenever a countries economy gets slapped around it affects the global economy, and a crash on this scale would certainly cause global issues. Historically, whenever there has been recessions, war always breaks out. Almost every time. Not necessarily in the US, but across the other nations as well. Considering our recent forays into the Middle East again, I don‚Äôt see us not getting dragged in. I also believe the tense situations over in that China, India, Pakistan area is a powder keg ready to let loose as well (remember all those Tik Toks with the Pakistani kids vowing to destroy India? They hate each other). 

So at this point, given where we stand, I almost think it‚Äôs more risky to not have a share of GME as a hedge against market collapse. And if it all goes south and GME goes to Pluto, I‚Äôm taking the tendies and investing in 3 things: 
- the digital security that cannot be named
- Precious metals
- and most importantly defense stocks

The defense stocks will be at rock bottom prices and I‚Äôll be ready to catch them with my tendies.

Anyway, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, I hardly know what I‚Äôm talking about in this discussion. I‚Äôm just and ape with a box of Crayolas. If you have a wrinkly brain feel free to tell me where I went wrong. 

TLDR: It‚Äôs too risky to not own GME. Taking the tendies upon market collapse and buying defense stonks."

Probably not. So let‚Äôs explore some other reasons/catalysts:
1. GME Hearings probably got interest high enough again. Could have helped but honestly I only remember getting more mad than optimistic about our current standing. DFV‚Äôs opening statement definitely helped make our case and when he stated that the price was attractive at these levels it certainly got a lot of attention.
2. DFV‚Äôs double down. Now I among many of us was sick to my stomach from the blue balls I got watching it go from 400-40. So it was a great relief to me when DFV sent out his update and double down. Made me feel a little less of an r-tard averaging down as it dropped.
3. Short interest report. It was good to know but being delayed by 2 weeks doesn‚Äôt necessarily give us a rosy picture. Being that SI was calculated differently and we were at least still above 50% that was fine. But we never seem to have gotten a concrete answer on REAL SI, not the BS they sent us but on old calculations.
4. Power outage at Melvin/citadel/banks? This one I‚Äôm confused on, there were reports of a power outage in some banks around the time we started rallying again, I thought their short ladder bots could no longer keep the price down which is what opened the doors for us last time. Now this is where I‚Äôm confused. Did this actually happen, is this why it rose so dramatically? We were getting mixed messages at the time of what actually caused the spike."

411,"AMC ""BULL TRAP""",2021-02-28 14:56:10,"Watch out for hedge funds ""Bull Trap"".

Hello friends,I just wanted to start by saying that I believe AMC &amp; GME to be under value at current prices and covid restrictions as well as NYC AMC opening back up.     NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC's price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that's how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn't make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF's decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.

Let just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF's ""Bull Trap"" so DO NOT FALL FOR IT &amp; DO NOT SELL your shares, they will be able to use your shares to increase their short interest attacks and continues their ladder attack as well. We need to decrease the number of shares available in the float NOT increase it, by selling your shares you actually increasing it. It is very important to decrease the number of shares available in the float, that's how you trigger the ""Short Squeeze"". Why would the HF's buy shares from us at $100 if they can just buy it from the float at $10 or $15 to cover their short interest? Would you?

Example:

On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".

I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.

""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""

The approval of Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.

A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.

Do NOT Sell my friends."

THEN....

I checked OPs profile and found that A METRIC FUCKTON of these are sub 30 day accounts with low karma. They‚Äôre even circle jerking each other or raising weak counterpoints and then conceding to OP. 

The old WSB saying goes, if you find a post that you might take action on, check the source. I can admit to chucking a few grand at some rando ticker bc it seemed like a good idea at the time- sometimes it paid off and sometimes it didn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm a little sad that those days are numbered for me. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing.

I see a lot of people accusing others of being bots or of foul play on relatively flimsy grounds like that.

u/crotchrocketpilot - Also, some WSB users delete our accounts every quarter/year for privacy. Why? Keep posting massive gains/losses, or an articulate analysis. You'll start getting spammed for various reasons. You'll see why."

422,Gamma squeeze has nothing to do with expiration,2021-02-28 12:33:19,"When a market maker sells you a call, they simultaneously buy the stock at the same time (well, they‚Äôre supposed to). If they don‚Äôt, they have huge risk exposure and would have to buy to hedge as price increases. The amount they buy depends on volatility and changes day to day. That‚Äôs called delta neutral hedging. For simplicity, i used a 1:1 hedge, but in reality delta dictates the amount of shares for the hedge. When enough calls are bought, this drives buying. This is the gamma squeeze. Most options are closed before expiration. Traders generally have no interest in exercising options and owning shares. What people fail to understand, is that the market maker already purchased the shares that would have to be sold to the option buyer if they did choose to exercise (unless they‚Äôre naked selling, which would be bad business for them and could bankrupt them). If they didn‚Äôt, and they sold you naked calls, they put themselves in a bad spot. They‚Äôd be on the hook to buy the shares if the names calls skyrocket. That purchase happened already. At exercise, you simply take the shares from the market maker and pay him the strike price for them. They aren‚Äôt bought on the open market, driving up the share price. That‚Äôs not how it works. Now, the reason why you see such volatility on Friday‚Äôs, is because traders are closing out their trades. When they sell the calls back to close the trade, the market maker then sells their shares back to the open market, driving the price down (it‚Äôs not always ‚Äúomg the shorts are doing a ladder attack!!‚Äù). Gamma squeeze happens at the time the calls are purchased because market maker is hedging to be delta neutral, not at expiration. Nobody is buying 40 million shares Monday morning because options expired ITM. That‚Äôs not how it works."

I am 21 years old and I have gambled upwards of over 1 million dollars since late 2019. Let me explain. I come from a family that is extremely educated. All my siblings are doctors and my father is an engineering professor. Many of my siblings left right around when I started high school. Despite the great success of my family, things have not always been perfect.

My father is an immigrant and is extremely cheap, callous, cheap, manipulative, and did I mention cheap? We lived extremely modestly in a wealthy area because they had good school districts. My family has often struggled to make friends of the whole family and my parents kept very weak connections with their family members. There have been many traumatizing moments for me including infidelity, abuse, and screaming that I have had to deal with since I was a child. In high school all of my siblings were moved out for their careers and education. Things started to really suck without them to say the least. My house has always been a complete dump. My parents and my sister have hoarding problems. Most of the house is unable to be walked through and has been for over 10 years. I have never invited any friends over because of how bad it looks. I think this is some psychological defense against outsiders, but I'm not sure. In my junior year of high school things began to go poorly and my parents stopped talking to each other for over a year and a half. I had to pass notes from the upstairs and downstairs rooms which they each lived so they could discuss things. It felt horrible. I was never one to quit so I continued on and had an amazing year outside of home. I showed up to school every day with a smile on my face and was loved by teachers and other people. I was one of the best students in the whole school. From then till senior year I won multiple awards, finished top % in basically every metric and was accepted to multiple institutions for tough undergrad programs and received many scholarships.

That brings us to today. My first year of college wasn't very exciting. I lived with a friend I've had since middle school and we explored the independent life. Sophomore year something happened, though. I saw an ad on instagram from an NFL player I loved promoting an app to make live sports bets. This wasn't traditional betting but rather a game that involved bets. I downloaded it and soon became hooked. I was great at it, they had a weekly contest I was winning hundreds and sometimes even $1000 on almost every week. I couldn't stop thinking about it. This was my own money. I had never had this money before. I bought shoes, a BRAND NEW iPhone which I still use today, and other needless things. After the app began to lose money and go broke I stopped doing it until junior year when I got into REAL sports betting. I deposited $500 of internship money into an account and turned it in $5000 in two weeks. I was hooked. My methodical strategies began to turn into madness. I would bet large sums on anything that was on. I had originally used this money to buy myself a car. My dad has a net worth of a few million but had refused to get me for years and made me ask my roommate to take me everywhere for years while making fun of him. I hated him for it. Once I lost my original $4500 profit I began to spiral. I used everything and maxed out my credit cards to bet. I had an obsession with betting the under ( this is basically what shorting is in the betting world). Soon I began to bet on things I couldn't watch: Russian table tennis, chinese basketball, turkish soccer, whatever was offered. I had to tell my mom what happened and she was in shock. She said this should not have happened and I will get you help. My dad sent me over 13k to pay off everything. I became so enraged I had cost them this I did it again a second time. Another 13k. I promised them it was over and after mulling they sent me the money again. Except I never stopped. I managed to stay alive continuing my habit by either needing money ""for new classes I'm signing up for"", coasting off of scholarship money I had to pay for classes, or getting lucky and paying off debt. Most of school I did the bare minimum and really only cared about my bets. Punched in live bets at the gym. In class. At Home. During Spring break. If I could I would bet. In January I had managed to pay off a 2k deficit and had 6k of money, in my hands, with no debt. Today I owe 11k. For just one second I wondered if I was even worth being alive. At this point my parents have basically disowned me unless I turn over my entire life to them. They don't know I never stopped.

This is where Gamestop comes in. I decided I would never gamble sports again and put my last 2k of profit into a brokerage. In late January I used my last 2k to buy 22 shares of gamestop at $88. I was lost in the movement staying up almost every night for premarket and checking my phone over 12 hours a day. I remember waking up to seeing 10k in my account from my shares. I didn't sell. Eventually I paper handed after robinhood stopped allowing buy of GME. With my small profit I returned to the market and built my account back up. Lost most of it and last week I bought 23 GME shares this time @ 116. My whole portfolio. Truly I don't care what happens anymore. I just like the stock. I'm not scared of anything and if I lose it all then I'll just make sure I remember how it felt to have nothing when I make it in this world one day because I know I will.

Nobody knows this, my roommate has lived with me for 4 years and is one of my best friends and actually thinks I'm doing well financially because of my early success. Today I watched the movie flight and I just felt like I had to get this off my chest somehow after watching the final few scenes.

I don't plan on speaking to my parents much again, they probably won't be at my graduation, and I wake up every day hating the decisions me and them have both made in our life. Right now GME is all I have. I'm here to shout to the rooftops why I'm here and where I'm from, this can happen to anybody. I don't want sympathy I just want to go to the moon. Apes strong.

This is not financial advice. I just like the stock. a lot. 23 @ 116"

Understand the data, charts reveal patterns and this looks like it will be a monthly cycle, until a crash, or more stocks become available(sold or issued by GME).

I had FOMO in January and tried to jump in on the Friday, we know what happened then. I didn't do research. I had cash and wanted get a win, but also thought I was helping to stick it to WS. Of course, got burned, but instead of selling, decided to hold, average down and try to get to a point I can get out with something positive(even if it isn't cash).

The only thing going for me is time, I don't need the cash (now), but will hope I can recoup the loses eventually. Right now it is a constant reminder every time I load Fidelity. It pisses me off every day to see the red(net loss), so wanted to come up with a way to help others.

Thinkorswim doesn't work for me; I need to experiment on a trade and see how that would happen with simulated trends.

2. OBV: The values are high, then a spike(sharp rise). If the level sustains, shit is about to happen. note each spike and how it lines up with other data
3. RSI: is running high at these spikes. when it spikes over 70 that is another signal, but if this crosses 30 downward watch out.
4. MACD: trend line is flat and the spread between signal line start to spread drastically.

Edit: per one of the comments below, will make my statement on this in this post. This will only help trying to find a good point to jump into a stock(not GME specific). For example, if you look at RKT today, with this new information would you buy tomorrow?

Edit: added the line about backtesting

Every time GME goes up loads the whole market tanks. Then recovers as GME goes down. I want GME to be hundreds of thousands per share like all of you, but hedge funds seem to have a way to never lose.

I've been trying tp post this for about 3 weeks now but still as bullish as ever on LVS

Now, the pandemic has slowed down Casino‚Äôs of the like due to social distance measures and lack of tourism. LVS has casinos all over the world from Vegas, to Macao to Singapore. They‚Äôve been hit hard but there is a light of hope. Because, regardless of a recession, depression or a pandemic people will always gamble. They got no money? They will find $10 and hope it turns into a $100.

Here we go, let's get horns-

**Prelude-** This is the company that owns that Huge Building in Singapore shaped like a cruise ship in the sky and charged me $40 for a bottle of water with dinner.

\#1 **MGM was upgraded but research houses reduced Las Vegas Sands due to their Asia exposure?**

I am sorry, what? Have you seen Asia? They are literally throwing festivals in China, Japan, Singapore and Australia etc. If you ever been to Asian countries you will find that they love to Drink, Smoke and Gamble. I feel if you are going into Casino/gambling company you NEED Asian Exposure. I could continue for many points on Asian casino‚Äôs but I‚Äôd lose concentration.

\#2- **Dr Michael Burry,** He is at it again, its no lie, I love him. He only has 2% of his portfolio invested in LVS but hey, he only had 4.3% in GME.

\#3 **The House Always wins**. People are going to come back, business will boom again and people are going to bet harder than they have before and the house always wins.

\#4 Hotels, Dining, Entertainment, Conventions and Exhibitions will all be sort after activities.

*Sands have a finger in each of these pies.*

\#5 **Online Casinos**\- there‚Äôs been rumors about them moving into deals with online casinos- which could future proof any thing along the lines of this pandemic again as well as increasing their reach to a digital level. In fact they have targeted 888 Holdings.

[https://www.casino.org/news/las-vegas-sands-could-make-run-at-888-holdings-to-move-into-igaming/](https://www.casino.org/news/las-vegas-sands-could-make-run-at-888-holdings-to-move-into-igaming/)

\#6 **Investing in themselves** They aren‚Äôt afraid to spend money- they're about to invest another $10b into Macau. Quote from earnings call-

¬∑ *‚ÄúWhen the Macanese government makes its decision I think we will continue upon a rather solid capital investment which I know is how* [*Sheldon*](https://www.asgam.com/index.php/2021/01/12/sheldon-adelson-supercharged-by-asia/) *felt, to grab that opportunity with both hands.‚Äù*

¬∑ *‚ÄúThere is just no place like Macau \[and\] we‚Äôre not done in Macau. We‚Äôre going to be there for many more years.*

¬∑ *‚ÄúWhen all this goes away, I bet one thing that will happen is the Macau government is going to necessitate that licensees make investments in Macau and we want to be there and be ready.‚Äù*

¬∑ *Noting that LVS is already in the midst of a US$3.3 billion expansion of its Marina Bay Sands property in Singapore, Goldstein observed, ‚ÄúThese are not small investments, they are in the billions of dollars, so we have to be prepared for outside investments in our best markets, which are Macau and Singapore for crazy growth.‚Äù*

**#7 Numbers**

¬∑ Earnings forecast to grow 88% vs 70% industry/20% market

¬∑ Volatility over the past 3 months has been low compared to rest of market.

450,A note on the possible ways shorts could worm their way out of this and one BIG problem we could face.,2021-02-28 16:00:10,"To start off with, I have to say that this post is not intended to spread FUD or to discourage people. This is a post to help us ‚Äúplan for the worst and hope for the best‚Äù. It is to open a discussion with people more knowledgeable than myself who can help clear up some of these issues.

&amp;#x200B;

While commenting on another post I started to realise some of the ways the hedge funds could try and climb out of this hole they have dug, or at least screw us over in the process of a squeeze. I have not seen these points being discussed nor do I know of any solid reasons why they couldn‚Äôt happen.

There is evidence that the shorts have already used illegal actions to supress the price and delay a full squeeze on GameStop. I cannot comment on whether they DEFINITELY committed any crimes, but in the interest of risk management I think we all need to presume they have done, and will do again.

You see, when an organisation has as much money as some of these hedge funds, they have power as well. Real power. Most people would presume the age of the 1% getting away with everything has passed, but it has just become more subtle. As the world saw in 2008, these people can and do get away with their crimes, even if it destroys entire economies.

Anyway, to get to the point, I have been thinking about multiple ways the shorts can and possibly will try and save themselves, or at least stop us from seeing the full potential of the squeeze.

\[Note: Some of these points are aimed directly at brokerages, but with the possibility that hedge funds may have pulled strings to manipulate the brokers in mind. i.e., Actions of brokerages that directly benefit the short sellers.\]

\[Note 2: This whole post is to be taken as a question of sorts. I am not stating facts, merely presenting problems. If anyone actually knows the definitive answer or likelihood to any of these problems then please comment.\]

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brokerages block the ‚Äòsell‚Äô option.**

Considering our problem last time was them blocking buys, this might not immediately seem like such a bad thing, because that would mean the price would only go up, right?

Stopping further short selling would benefit us as the price couldn‚Äôt be supressed as much, but stopping us from selling would just mean the price would go up, and we‚Äôd be left watching as we are unable to ever sell. As much as I am willing to hold forever if I have to, we are all hoping for it to reach such a price where we would sell eventually.

But wouldn‚Äôt this be illegal? Would it? I thought that blocking buys would be illegal but apparently not. If they can block the buys they can probably block the sells as well ‚Äì they bury a lot of manipulative and controlling stuff in their terms and conditions. If anyone with a greater understanding of the law knows about the legality of restricting selling could let us know then that would be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brokerages allow people to sell at extreme profits, but refuse to pay the astronomical prices.**

This is one that definitely **should** be illegal, and something even the most untouchable couldn‚Äôt get away with. With that said, I don‚Äôt feel comfortable resting everything on a ‚Äòshould‚Äô. Whether you think it at all possible or not, imagine if the massive target of $30million per share actually happens. Can you really see all these brokerages just coughing up straight away without any fuss?

Or, is it at all possible that they could yet again hide behind legal loopholes and fine print to refrain from paying us those amounts? ‚ÄúThere is a maximum amount you can have in your account at one time‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis is over the maximum amount of money we can handle in a transaction‚Äù, ‚ÄúDue to the extreme volatility of this stock, sell order could not be processed, the number you are seeing on screen is incorrect and will be removed from your account. Do not try to withdraw any of this money.‚Äù The list goes on.

I especially want to make it clear here that I am asking if any of this is possible. I am a bit of an idiot but I think a discussion is worth having on these matters, because as far as I am concerned, everything is on the table and nothing is too farfetched.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brokerages artificially fake outages and failures, blocking people from using their services and pretending they were just overwhelmed with the extreme, sudden increase in volume of users again.**

How do we know they haven‚Äôt already done this? They can stop people from trading freely while blaming technology and even the large amount of people using their service.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Hedge funds digitally attacking brokerages to cut off a large chunk of retail investors and lock them out of the squeeze.**

Is it possible the hedge funds could pay others to attack the brokerages digitally, whether through something like a DDoS attack or other methods? I imagine they would especially target the large no-commission brokers like Robinhood and T212.

It also seems to me like it would be a difficult crime to trace back to the hedge funds, and I actually see very little reason why hedge funds wouldn‚Äôt be able to do this. With the amount of money the hedgies are set to lose, they are going to be desperate and willing to resort to desperate measures. If this did happen and we were unable to sell then would we be entitled to compensation?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# THE BIG ONE.

**\[Update:** I have had numerous people commenting with good explanations of the following point. I am now considering 'THE BIG ONE' not so big anymore, and thank you all for your input.\]

If the main shorts responsible for all of this go bankrupt before they are able to buy back every single share they‚Äôd have to, what would happen then?

If the numbers people are estimating are even close to the true possible number then I would say it‚Äôs very likely they‚Äôd go bankrupt very quickly. It is my understanding that most debts of sorts are written off when a company or organisation files for bankruptcy, which is the main reason some people force their own companies into bankruptcy only the re-launch with a different name and no debt.

If we really do destroy the hedge funds that are behind the majority of the short positions, then do we destroy ourselves in the process? I can‚Äôt see them being forces to pay up billions upon billions in debt if they are bankrupt, because they would never reasonably obtain that money. In that case, who is going to pay?

My best guess is that in one the worst case scenarios the price skyrockets as they cover as much as they can and then it just stops when they run out of money. No one else is going to voluntarily buy those shares at those prices so wouldn‚Äôt we end up with GME stalling at an insane price but with no one able to sell and no one able to buy, meaning the share price would just‚Ä¶ stop?

If that did happen then I can‚Äôt see the SEC or the US Government (simply because it‚Äôs a US stock) doing nothing as for the first time a stock get‚Äôs infinitely stuck. Therefore, would they then artificially lower the price to get people buying again? This would mean none of us could actually sell at the price it reaches.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you even made it this far you are all probably pissed off at me for saying it over and over, but I am NOT claiming any of this will happen. The last thing I want to do is unintentionally spread FUD. I‚Äôm presuming some will call me a shill anyway for even bringing these points up but I need to clarify that I am invested in GME and I am confident that it will squeeze at some point. I am 100% in this cause, and I don‚Äôt believe this is any reason for people to worry or be demotivated.

With that said, I am not so na√Øve as to presume this will all go perfectly for us with no obstacles ‚Äì just look at last time when they stopped us from buying and killed the upwards momentum. We need to be as best prepared as we can, and ideally we need a legal ‚Äòmutually assured destruction‚Äô to dissuade anything I have mentioned here.

What I am asking for is for people to PLEASE prove me wrong. If any of you have a greater knowledge of the law or the inner workings of things then please comment and let us all know.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to anyone who may be able to help."

This goes from the psychological warfare, manipulation of reporting and broker activity behind the scenes but also just general information around how the investment sphere works.

Fuck me so much shit has happened. Even that 99% retard where there is now a conspiracy around their dd and a conspiracy about the critique of their dd. 


There is so many opinions and quality looking DD of DD that if you are like me it is completely overwhelming, but i trust the reason why i made my investment and I understand the maths behind it.
I understand the best way to get a return on my investment is to buy the stock i want to and just hold until i see a number I‚Äôm happy to sell for without over leveraging myself.


If you are like me and you started this wild ride of investing for the first time and like me you were retarded enough to go balls deep in gme 2021, just relax. Pick a number you want to sell for and wait for it, its that simple.


If you believe in the reason you invested, nothing you read should change that.

Beyond Meat and PepsiCo have announced the formation of a joint venture called The Planet Partnership to develop snacks and beverages made from plant-based protein. This is Beyond‚Äôs first expansion outside of plant-based meats, indicating that its total addressable market is likely larger than investors initially envisioned. The shares are responding accordingly, surging 20% on the news. If the venture is limited to the types of products already in Pepsi‚Äôs lineup, the Beyond Meat stock movement is likely an overreaction, as plant-based Frappuccino, Muscle Milk, and Matador jerky would likely not generate the $300 million in annual revenue needed to justify it. If the venture expands to other dairy and meat-based products outside of Pepsi‚Äôs current portfolio, the market opportunity will be larger, but so will execution risks as the firms move further away from their traditional areas of expertise. Additionally, while Pepsi has had several successful partnerships, not all its deals have panned out well.  The partnership with Pepsi is a wise approach to leveraging Beyond‚Äôs plant-based protein expertise and Pepsi‚Äôs marketing and distribution muscle in order to meet consumers‚Äô growing appetite for sustainable products. 





üöÄüöÄ  

Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat, or PBM, industry, offering the first burger to look and taste like meat, although it was soon followed by Impossible Foods and many others. Given the rapidly changing marketplace, it is too early to tell if Beyond‚Äôs first-mover advantage will result in a sustained market leadership position. A primary growth driver to be the 20% of consumers willing to adjust their habits to benefit the environment, as Beyond‚Äôs products emit 90% less greenhouse gases, require 93% less land, 99% less water, and 46% less energy to produce than their meat equivalents. PBMs will be very successful abroad, in China and India in particular, the world‚Äôs two most populated countries, each with 1.4 billion people. The products offer a great solution for China, which does not have enough arable land to feed its huge population, and a great fit for India‚Äôs large vegetarian population. Both countries are highly amenable to the products, with surveys showing 96% of Chinese and 94% of India‚Äôs population are likely to try the products, compared with 75% of U.S. consumers. The global PBM market will grow from $12 billion in 2019 to $74 billion by 2029 (a 19% CAGR), as PBMs grow from 2.5% of the ground meat market to 12%. Models show Beyond‚Äôs market share increasing from 2.5% in 2019 to nearly 9% in 2029, as PBMs gain a larger share of the overall meat category, and as Beyond‚Äôs brand continues to win with consumers, given its strong performance in taste tests and ongoing R&amp;D investments.





üöÄüöÄüöÄ 

 There has been substantial consumer interest in Beyond Burger, which could signal modest initial brand strength, although the sustainability is far from a guarantee. The brand has been successfully used to drive traffic into restaurants. In the summer of 2018, A&amp;W Canada, the country's second largest burger chain, ran an advertising campaign promoting the Beyond Burger, and the campaign drove a material increase in guest counts, leading to record same-store sales growth in the quarters following the launch, and the restaurant reported that it was the fastest new-product launch in the history of the chain. When Beyond Burger launched at TGI Fridays, it was also the fastest new product launch in the chain's history. Consumers flocked to KFC in Atlanta for a limited time test of Beyond Chicken, causing the store to sell out of the product in under five hours. That day the restaurant sold as many Beyond Chicken boneless wings and nuggets as it would normally sell of its popcorn chicken in a week. In April 2020, McDonald‚Äôs CEO stated the firm will launch a plant-based burger, but he was unsure of the timing. In November, the chain indicated the burger will likely not carry the Beyond brand, but we think Beyond will be a primary supplier, as Beyond helped to develop the product and few firms have enough capacity. The deal could add about $180 million in annual sales, increasing our valuation by 14% to $166.




üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
  
Beyond Meat is a pioneer in the plant-based meat (PBM) industry, launching the Beyond Burger, the first vegetarian burger designed to look and taste like meat, during the second quarter of 2016, shortly followed by privately held Impossible Foods' Impossible Burger, launched July 2016. While Beyond Meat is not the first PBM to hit the market, as wide-moat Kellogg's MorningStar Farms brand has been on the market since 1975, Beyond Burger revolutionized the category by targeting omnivores (95% of U.S. consumers) and first merchandised the products in the meat case in 2016. Also, unlike its predecessors, Beyond Meat seeks to make its products indistinguishable from their animal-protein equivalents in terms of appearance, taste, texture, and cookability. Legacy players (Kellogg's MorningStar Farms, Conagra's Gardein, Kraft-Heinz's Boca Burger) have sought to produce a vegetable- based product that tastes good, but does not mimic meat, which would not appeal to the products' largely vegetarian customer base. However, seeing the strong demand for meat-like PBMs from omnivores, several similar meat-like products, have launched over the past year. It took Beyond Meat seven years and Impossible Foods five years to develop a PBM that tastes, looks, and even bleeds like real meat. As the industry is in its infancy, and most competitive products are in the process of launching, it is too early to know if Beyond's first-mover advantage will prove prohibitive to overcome (similar to wide-moats Coke and Pepsi), or if the new products (most from well-resourced firms) will be able to quickly develop products that resonate with consumers. .




TLDR

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Plant-based meats (PBM) should continue to grow rapidly as the products gain additional share from the traditional ground meat category. Beyond Meat should be a major beneficiary of PBM growth, given its first-mover advantage, and the brand‚Äôs strong performance in taste tests. Beyond Meat will likely be a major PBM supplier for McDonald's, as it worked with the chain to develop its plant-based burger, and few competitors have enough capacity to supply the large restaurant. A deal could add $180 million in annual sales.

471,Snack on the Sneakiest Short Squeeze of all time with UTZüöÄüöÄüöÄ,2021-03-01 02:28:46,"I know what you‚Äôre thinking. A potato chip company, you gotta be kidding me. I also know you‚Äôre thinking another fucking short squeeze, but hear me out‚Ä¶ There is something VERY strange going on with this stock and I‚Äôm here to shed some light on it. 

Well listen here smooth brain because I‚Äôm not kidding and I would never fucking touch a company that moves as slowly as this stock unless I thought I could make a shitload of money. 

There is the sneakiest short squeeze of all time going on here and I‚Äôm ready to exploit it and apparently somebody else is too. 

So here it is, laid out as simply as I can put for you dumbasses. Somebody (insider, smart-money, whoever) who knows something we don‚Äôt know is betting BIG that this stock is hitting 30$ by the March 19th expiration. They have **OVER 600,000$ riding on this call that sits 5$ out of the money**\- it's the absolute definition of unusual options activity and when coupled with the fact the stock rarely has any options volume and it has ZERO upcoming public events something is about to happen and we just don‚Äôt know it yet. 

[Unusual Option Activity on 2\/17 for March 30c](https://preview.redd.it/b95j2t6bubk61.png?width=645&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35b88b935343a21aac7fb5f6d57e75ac2dffbc24)

My thoughts are pretty simple- this stock is on its way up to the fucking moon and with contracts this cheap now after a market slump the opportunity to **10X or 15X** your invest is there. Somebody knows something is going on and with UTZ ‚Äòs recent history of buying up other brands On the Border Tortilla Chips (Second leading tortilla chip brand) and Vitner‚Äôs (A Chicago based salty snack manufacturer) a merger is most likely on the horizon and undoubtedly sending this stock over 30$. This merger or announcement would send the shorts running and in an attempt to cover they‚Äôd find themselves buying back the stock at insane amounts. 

If you made it this far I bet you already are considering it so why waste your time anymore.

**TLDR: Buy March 19th 30C wait for a big random catalyst event and enjoy.**

For a deeper analysis of what I think will happen here it is:

**The most likely scenario: UTZ 32$+ Per Share 500% Return**

Unlike most of the other companies looked at on this forum UTZ actually makes money. It IPO‚Äôd via a SPAC merger and has been on a tear up over 150% since then. However, unlike your typical SPAC this company makes good money and has a good balance sheet with plenty of cash on hand. They‚Äôve been using this cash to buy other brands like crazy in hopes of expanding their market out of the mostly the northeast and midwest to the rest of the country. Their CEO Dylan Lissette has made it known on CNBC that he wants to grow the company and has aggressive plans to do so. This would lend that big better to most likely be anticipating a massive merger in the following weeks which would allow them to cash in their huge position at a massive gain. 

**The rare but plausible scenario: UTZ Short Squeeze 50$+ Per Share 5000% Return**

This will sound a little crazy but at this point I know you guys will believe anything if I put enough rockets and tell you I‚Äôll make you rich- which I am. So listen, **THIS WILL MAKE YOU RICH IF IT HAPPENS AND IT'S WORTH BETTING ON**. There is the possibility for a quick short squeeze and a subsequent gamma squeeze the likes of which would send this **WELL** stock beyond 50$. 

Here is some quick math for you:

15.23% of the stock is held by insiders.

71.26% of the stock is held by institutions. 

There are 2.95 MILLION shares SHORTED.

What this all means is that with the current amount of stock held by insiders and institutions there is only 8 millions shares free float. This becomes a big problem for the shorts very quickly if the stock price shoots up on a merger, not only because they are forced to buy back their shares BUT market makers are now involved due to the larger options orders THAT if soon become in the money will FORCE them to buy shares of the underlying stock to remain delta neutral.

As you know market makers try their best to remain delta neutral when making deals. When this big buyer came in and forced market makers to open 5,000 contracts with a delta of 0.25 they were forced to buy 25% of the shares they owed in those 5,000 contracts- to remain delta neutral as I said. 

5,000 contracts = 500,000 outstanding shares (if the contracts are in the money) 

In order to remain delta neutral they would have to purchase 125,000 shares. Which they did as seen here: When the big buy orders hit the tape at 10:11 AM we see a huge spike as market makers buy in as they need to have 125,000 shares purchased to remain delta neutral. 

[MM Big Purchase at 10:11 on 2\/17](https://preview.redd.it/gso9r544vbk61.jpg?width=1177&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cff362d577d8fe165cfc3728b8bac6b5e7cef50)

As open interest increases and we now see it nearing closer to 7,000 contracts, as the stock moves closer to 30$ more market makers will be forced to buy in and thus leave less room for the shorts to cover their asses. If buying increases and stock is held then these shorts could be on the hook for a lot of money.

""The Company is not currently in the production stage and generally utilizes suppliers for outside development and engineering support.""

SOURCE: see 10K page 78 here: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1731289/000173128921000006/nkla-20201231.htm#i58a5fa00c30341b39fdb3dd97678d6e1_624

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/26/nikola-corporation-nkla-q4-2020-earnings-call-tran/

In fact, 10k states it clearly:

""We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of our trucks, which is not expected to begin at least until 2022 for our BEV truck and the second half of 2023 for our FCEV truck, and may occur later. Even if we are able to successfully develop and sell or lease our trucks, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful""

And here:

""We expect to derive revenue from our BEV trucks in late 2021 and FCEV trucks in the second half 2023. Prior to commercialization, we must complete modification or construction of required manufacturing facilities, purchase and integrate related equipment and software, and achieve several research and development milestones. As a result, we will require substantial additional capital to develop our products and services and fund operations for the foreseeable future. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from product sales and hydrogen FCEV leases, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of existing cash on hand, public offerings, private placements, debt financings, collaborations, and licensing arrangements.""

And here:

‚ÄúWe expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be significantly high in future periods as we:

‚Ä¢design, develop and manufacture our trucks;

‚Ä¢construct and equip our manufacturing plant to produce our trucks in Arizona;

‚Ä¢modify and equip the Iveco manufacturing plant in Germany to produce our trucks in Europe;

‚Ä¢build up inventories of parts and components for our trucks;

manufacture an available inventory of our trucks;

‚Ä¢develop and deploy our hydrogen fueling stations;

‚Ä¢expand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities;

‚Ä¢increase our sales and marketing activities and develop our distribution infrastructure; and

‚Ä¢increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.

Because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenue with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significant. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenue, which would further increase our losses.""

Then there's is the pesky issue of multiple lawsuits and investigations hanging over Nikola:

‚ÄúOn September 10, 2020, Hindenburg Research LLC reported on certain aspects of the Company‚Äôs business and operations. The Company and its board of directors retained Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP to conduct an internal review in connection with the Hindenburg article (the ‚ÄúInternal Review‚Äù), and Kirkland &amp; Ellis promptly contacted the Division of Enforcement of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to make it aware of the commencement of the Internal Review. The Company subsequently learned that the staff of the Division of Enforcement had previously opened an investigation. On September 14, 2020, the Company and¬†five¬†of its officers and employees, including Mark Russell, our Chief Executive Officer, received subpoenas from the Staff of the Division of Enforcement as a part of a fact-finding inquiry related to aspects of the Company‚Äôs business as well as certain matters described in the Hindenburg article. The Staff of the Division of Enforcement issued additional subpoenas to another¬†three¬†of the Company‚Äôs officers and employees, including Kim Brady, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, on September 21, 2020 and to the Company‚Äôs current and former directors on September 30, 2020.

The Company and Mr. Milton also received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the Southern District of New York (the ‚ÄúSDNY‚Äù) on September 19, 2020.
(...)
The Company also received a grand jury subpoena from the N.Y. County District Attorney‚Äôs Office on September 21, 2020. On October 16, 2020, the N.Y. County District Attorney‚Äôs Office agreed to defer its investigation; it has not withdrawn its subpoena issued to the Company, but has informed the Company that no further productions to it are necessary at this time.
(...)
The Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations, nor can it predict whether any other governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations. The outcome of the Staff of the Division of Enforcement and the SDNY investigations and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include a wide variety of outcomes, including the institution of administrative, civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving the Company and/or current or former employees, officers and/or directors, the imposition of fines and other penalties, remedies and/or sanctions, modifications to business practices and compliance programs and/or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions. 
(...)
Further, to the extent that these investigations and any resulting third-party claims yield adverse results over time, such results could jeopardize the Company's operations and exhaust its cash reserves, and could cause stockholders to lose their entire investment.

Shareholder Securities Litigation

Beginning on September 15, 2020,¬†six¬†putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors, asserting violations of federal securities laws under Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ‚ÄúExchange Act‚Äù), and, in one case, violations of the Unfair Competition Law under California law (the ‚ÄúShareholder Securities Litigation‚Äù). The complaints generally allege that the Company and certain of its officers and directors made false and/or misleading statements in press releases and public filings regarding the Company's business plan and prospects.
(...) 
Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount in damages, attorneys‚Äô fees, and other relief. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.

Derivative Litigation

Beginning on September 23, 2020,¬†two¬†purported shareholder derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Byun v. Milton, et al., Case No. 1:20-cv-01277-UNA;¬†Salguocar v. Girsky et. al.,¬†Case No. 1:20-cv-01404-UNA), purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company's current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and gross mismanagement. The¬†Byun¬†action also brings claims for unjust enrichment and abuse of control, while the¬†Salguocar¬†action brings a claim for waste of corporate assets.
(...)
On December 18, 2020, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona,¬†Huhn v. Milton et al.,¬†Case No. 2:20-cv-02437-DWL, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against certain of the Company‚Äôs current and former directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, unjust enrichment, and against defendant Jeff Ubben, a member of the Company‚Äôs board of directors, insider selling and misappropriation of information.
(...)
The complaints seek unspecified monetary damages, costs and fees associated with bringing the actions, and reform of the Company's corporate governance, risk management and operating practices. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the foregoing complaints. The Company is unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these lawsuits, which could be material.""

The problem with all these investigations and lawsuits is that Nikola Motor has admitted that they have merit:

‚ÄúThe Hindenburg article alleged that Mr. Milton or the Company made a number of statements, which it asserted were inaccurate, including but not limited to the following:

1.in July 2016, the Company stated that it owned rights to natural gas wells, and in August 2016 that the wells were used as a backup to solar hydrogen production;

2.in August 2016, Milton and the Company stated that the Company had engineered a zero emissions truck;

3.in December 2016, Milton stated that the Nikola One was a fully functioning vehicle;

4.that an October 2017 video released by the Company gave the impression the Nikola One was driven;

5.in April 2019, Milton stated that solar panels on the roof of the Company‚Äôs headquarters produce approximately¬†18¬†megawatts of energy per day;

6.in December 2019 and July 2020, Milton stated that the Company ‚Äúcan produce‚Äù over¬†1,000¬†kg of hydrogen at the Company‚Äôs demo stations and that the Company was ‚Äúdown below‚Äù $3/kg at that time;

7.in July 2020, Milton stated that ‚Äúall major components are done in house‚Äù; he made similar statements in June 2020;

8.in July 2020, Milton stated that the inverter software was the most advanced in the world and that other OEMs had asked to use it; and

9.in July 2020, Milton stated that¬†five¬†trucks were ‚Äúcoming off the assembly line‚Äù in Ulm, Germany.

The statements listed above were inaccurate in whole or in part, when made.""

And last, but not least, don't forget the upcoming 136. MM shares lockup expiration ending on May 1st, 2021:

‚ÄúIn November, 2020, members of our board of directors, executive officers, their affiliates and certain entities associated with those individuals voluntarily agreed to extend their original lock-up provisions which were agreed to in connection with the Business Combination on an aggregate of approximately 136,700,000 shares of our common stock, including vested stock options and warrants, through April 30, 2021.""

\*\*$SENS\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Current Share price (2/28): $ 3.46

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*THESIS:\*\*

Based on my DD I believe that SENS will be seen as substantially undervalued at its current market value in the near/mid future. With their 180-day sensor having been brought to market last quarter in Europe we should get impressive numbers out of them at earnings. This will establish to investors what the potential market for these kinds of devices will be. Due to the Diabetes epidemic in the United States the market for these sensors will be substantially higher than overseas. Once investors have the data from overseas sales they will extrapolate the potential earnings in the US and the fair value of the stock will rise dramatically. Over the next 2 years this type of technology will become industry standard for reading glucose levels as it saves users from constant finger pricks and will be able to supply doctors with substantially more data into a patient‚Äôs glucose levels. As the biopharma industry realizes this data can be used to analyze blood sugar levels in diabetics on a scale never seen before there will be a push from the biopharma industry to make these industry standard in order to accelerate the discoveries of new Diabetes treatments.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*ANALYSIS: ITM CALL BREAKDOWN\*\*

7/26 $1C

Current Premium = $2.55.

Delta = .9513 Gama =.0263 Theta = -.0014 Vega = .0021

&amp;#x200B;

This premium is essentially the difference in cost of the current share price and the cost to exercise. Delta is high, Gama is low. This means for every $1 SENS increases the option will increase in value by $.95. Because Gama is low there is little room for the delta to grow past its current place. As the stock price grows deeper ITM Delta will increase slightly. If the stock price dips and becomes closer to the strike price Delta will decrease by the rate of Gama. Theta on this call is very low, it will take a long time before Theta rises to the point where Theta decay will become substantial. Vega is low, meaning implied volatility is considered low on this option. If the price of the stock were to begin to rise quickly Vega will rise as implied volatility increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Takeaways from this information

&amp;#x200B;

1. Delta and Gama are already priced into the Call, any growth you would see beyond a 1:1 ratio to the stock price will not come from the stock growing at its      current rate.
2. This is a safe call to hold for long term as the Theta is low.
3. Vega is not priced into the call. If the stock price were to begin to grow at a rate faster than it has historically Vega will begin to increase, accelerating the growth of the call.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the potential benefits of buying this Call?

\-  If you believe the stock has room to continue growing at its current rate this call could be used to take a position in the stock at a discounted price. Instead of purchasing 100 shares for $346 you could buy this equivalent call for $255. If the stock price were to rise from here to $4.46 you would net a similar profit from purchasing the 100 shares or the call but would have needed less starting capital to do so.

\- If you believe that a catalyst is going to be coming sometime between now and EXPY this call would begin to grow in value beyond the rate of the stock price as Vega increases. This is because the higher Vega is not priced into the call at its current premium.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the potential downsides of buying this call?

\- As the delta is already high any decrease in the share value will see a 1:1 ratio in the decrease in the Call‚Äôs premium. If the share price were to drop to $2.46 from its current price the Delta will decrease the Call‚Äôs premium to $1.55. This would be a 40% decrease in the calls value. This is a 10% larger loss of your starting capital than if you simply took the $255 you used for the premium of the call and used it to purchase it‚Äôs equivalent in shares.

\- Holding the call rather than shelling out the additional capital to purchase the shares means that you cannot hedge your position throughout its lifespan. If you are holding this call long term because you believe the stock is going to continue to grow at its current rate there will be unrealized gains that you could have made by selling Covered Calls along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Ways to utilize this Call to make a profit:

\- Because this Call has a low Theta it is safe to hold for a while as a stand in for 100 shares. This Call can be used to make gains short-term by purchasing now and selling when the stock hits your target price. By doing so you will earn the profits of 100 shares while having used less starting capital to do so. If Vega increases beyond what it is now than the change in volatility will help to supplement the profits that would have been earned on those same shares.

I would think this Call has more value potential than 100 shares if:

\- I believed that there is going to be a catalyst to disrupt its current rate of growth.

&amp;#x200B;

A Possible Catalyst for $SENS Could Be:

\-  Earnings could show Impressive sales numbers from their European business, showing proof that there is demand and interest for their product. 

\- Their sensor being granted FDA approval within the time frame of the call. 

Either of these catalysts could trigger an increase in implied volatility (raising Vega).

&amp;#x200B;

I run the risk of:

\-The stock falling on earnings below a threshold that other positive news could raise it above its current market value. This would result in a loss to my starting capital greater than if I purchased shares with the cost of the premium.

&amp;#x200B;

Possible Scenarios:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Earnings creates increased interest in the      stock. The price rises faster than it has been historically. Sell offs      occur as investors reach their exit price. The price begins to rise again      as other investors FOMO into the stock on the dip. As other catalysts form      this pattern (large amounts of new investors buying in as long-term      holders sell off) continues over a long enough period of time causing the      implied volatility of the stock to increase. The share price rises over      time on the waves.

\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price.

\- The increased Vega from the higher implied volatility also raises the cost of the premium.

\- The call becomes substantially more profitable than shares.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Earnings has very little impact on interest of SENS. The share price grows gradually as its fair value increases.

\-The already high delta means it is good for a near 1:1 raise in Call value with stock price.

\-Vega remains unchanged

\- The calls profitability grows at a rate similar to that of the underlying shares.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Earnings causes a massive shift in interest away from $SENS and the stock price sees a sharp drop followed by a continued bleed until it hits a price where it is viewed as undervalued. 

\- The high delta makes the call depreciate quickly

\- Vega will remain relatively unchanged.

\- The Call loses value quickly.

For this Call I think the most likely scenario is somewhere between 1 and 2. Whether it be earnings or FDA approval I think there will be continued rise in interest in SENS. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Position (Entering Monday Morning):

200 Shares (Cost = $692) - I am going to hold these shares long term as SENS becomes more profitable. In the interim I am going to sell monthly covered calls on these 100% over whatever their current market value is to generate a small profit through premiums.

Example: The current price is $3.46 as of 2/28/21. I will sell 2 $7C 4/16 for a combined premium of $78. 

\-----------

10 X $1C 7/16 (Premium $2.50, Total Cost = $2550) - These will be the base of my position. Purchasing these over shares at current market value saves me $910 in capital. As I believe that SENS will come to be seen as undervalued at its current market price over the next 4 months I should see a profit at minimum equivalent to the shares they represent with the added upside of any increases due to an increase in Vega down the line.

\----------------

5 X $10C 1/20/2023 (Premium = $2.25, Total Cost = $1115) - These Calls are considerably attractive to me for two reasons. First ‚Äì I believe that $12 (The Break-Even Price) by the end of 2022 will be under market value for SENS. Second ‚Äì The Greeks present an opportunity to turn a profit short term should my thesis be altered. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Greeks

Delta = .7902, Gama = .0340, Theta = -.0018, Vega = .0136

&amp;#x200B;

For obvious reasons any Call planning to be held long term must have a very low Theta. Vega is priced higher than the 7/16 Calls I broke down, but I believe any drop in premium that could be caused by a decrease in Vega will be substantially offset by the Delta and Gama. A .7902 Delta for a Call that is over 100% OTM is substantial. Gama is high enough that the Delta will increase at a decent rate as the stock grows in price.

‚óè It is worth noting that a Delta this high on an OTM call means that the calls have plenty of room to drop if the share price falls below its current market price, increasing the risk of higher losses on this play.

&amp;#x200B;

Exit Strategy:

\- Continue to hold shares and sell monthly covered calls 100% above market value until the rest of the play resolves. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- If the value of my 7/16 Calls at any point becomes 200% higher than the value of the underlying shares I will trim 50% of this position. The other 50% will be held until July to be either sold or to be exercised. If these calls maintain a value similar the underlying shares I will hold until July and exercise at EXPY and begin to sell monthly covered calls 50% above market value until the rest of the play resolves or until assigned.

&amp;#x200B;

\- I will hold the 1/20/23 Calls throughout all of 2021. If in 2022 profit levels reach +2000% sell 1. Sell another every time profit rises another 2000%. If profit never reaches target by June of 2022 adjust numbers to +1000%. If by October of 2022 profit targets have not been reached and share price is below $12 close position. If Share price remains above $12 hold until EOY and exercise Calls.

&amp;#x200B;

After the Play

\- Continue to sell monthly covered calls of any accumulated shares at 20% above market value until assigned or until information comes up that would compel me to close out my position."

484,NVAX part II - Last call before a shit ton of catalysts,2021-03-01 00:03:54,"[Link to pt I](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/)

TL;DR for Pt 1 is below:

1) NVAX has the best in class vaccine and has the technological advantage of being able to easily become multivalent. This means with 1 vaccine you can get immunity for multiple variants and even the Flu as well. Other companies, particularly MRNA companies, need to give you a separate vaccine for each dose. Also it can be stored at 4C long term (unlike MRNA which needs -20C to -70C long term) and it has less side effects and has the highest reported efficacy to date (95.6%).

2) NVAX is fundamentally undervalued. Sitting at a market cap of $15Bn it is cheap as shit rn. This company is expecting to produce 2 BILLION doses per year and has many deals established already with multiple countries for \~1.6 Bn doses this year alone. For reference, MRNA announced last week it expects a revenue of $18 Bn dollars in 2021. Guess how many doses they are planning to produce? 600 million. And they have a market cap of 62 Bn.

3) TONS of catalysts coming up.

\-Earnings call on Monday. If they give revenue estimates even half as good as MRNA they will pop to Pluto.

\-EU dose deal and approval. France and UK are already saying they're on the cusp of approval. Literally just waiting for finalization of UK phase 3 data which should come soon (this week? earnings call maybe as they did in the past for nanoFlu phase 3 results?). Approval will be their FIRST approved vaccine ever.

\-South Africa variant vaccine study. They already started developing their South Africa variant vaccine. More updates on this could send the stock up since it actually is for once not far behind MRNA and probably ahead of PFE for this.

\-NanoFlu. 9 months ago they revealed amazing phase 3 data for a new flu vaccine that is better than the current gold standard. They've been blue balling us saying they're almost ready to apply for an EUA since then. IDK when this will happen it seems they have their hands full with covid (maybe even a covid+flu vaccine?) but consider this one a slam dunk.

4) United States market share DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER. Everyone and their dog will say ""ah but they're too late. US already has enough doses for the whole population"". A) This is retarded the US will still buy NVAX doses. They will not be caught with their pants down and run out of vaccines in the future because they decided to be fully dependent on two companies with new vaccine modalities. B) This doesn't matter anyways, they have deals for 1Bn+ vaccines in the rest of the world (including many developed nations). PLUS they'll gobble up US market share eventually if they can get multivariant covid + flu vaccines going.

This company is severely undervalued. Short term price target of $500. This will come after EU approval and potential US EUA based on UK data (crossing my fingers for this). Long term price target of $1000+. 

WARNING this stock is not for paper handed bitches. Expect tons of volatility. However, it is in my opinion a clear slam dunk which has lots of short interest and might even end up in squeeze territory soon.

Positions: Missionary, $220c April 16th, eventually would like to roll out to July expirations. Honestly shares are prob a good way to go with this one. I've been getting my ass handed to me by holding this stock during this pullback but I'm not even scared and I bought even more. Anything under $300 for this stock is a steal."

486,Charles Schwab is hiding a giant ball of shit and won't come out and say what happened. How big is the ball of shit?,2021-02-28 00:53:32,"Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.

I'm just here to tell you the story.

This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)

Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.

Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:

* Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume.
* U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE)
* Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post)
* Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved.
* Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?)
* 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5

**= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""

Important points:

1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue.
2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks.
3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018)
4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...

It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.

**Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**

Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.

487,Why does $AXON have $0 debt on their B.S?,2021-03-01 03:49:25,"I love AXON. I love the stock and I love the company. Sure, they‚Äôve been running a little hot lately, but so has the rest of the market and a slight correction seemed inevitable. They make awesome products, have done a fantastic job integrating a Recurring revenue stream and SaaS model into their product suite, and they‚Äôve seemingly cornered the market and are only just now beginning to expand their Intl footprint (from their 4Q20 call). 
The one thing Im left puzzled by is their lack of debt. On their 4Q20 call and supplemental material they highlighted ‚Äú$0 debt!‚Äù. Maybe an idiot or pure operator who knows nothing about finance would see that and celebrate it, but not only has the cost of debt been at all time lows, we know from M&amp;M prop I &amp; II that a company‚Äôs capital structure absolutely affects its value. 
It is smart for all companies to have debt, especially publicly traded companies unless they believe their stock is trading above fair market value in which case they‚Äôd sell stock to raise capital (which AXON did on the 4thQ), but in general this feels like a bad strategy and sends the wrong signal to the market. 
AXON‚Äôs cfo seems like a smart enough guy and none of the analyst on the call asked about this, so maybe there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing. 
Can anyone shed some light on why AXON is proud to have $0 in debt?"

492,My $RIDE or die - Lordstown Motors,2021-02-28 18:54:06,"  

I will start with my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for this DD post ‚Äì I‚Äôm from Ohio. Born and raised. There has been a lot of pain for us Ohioans over the years. The weather here sucks, the Browns were complete GARBAGE for over 2 decades, and recently, a huge General Motors plant closed and cost our state thousands of jobs.

Enter Lordstown Motors and CEO Steve Burns who saw an opportunity to acquire the [3rd most productive automotive plant](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) in the country for pennies on the dollar and initially target fleet customers (a [very specific niche](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-surpasses-100-000-124500104.html)) with [disruptive technology](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/best-2020-lordstown-motors-wheel-hub-motors/) in their vehicles.

**LM is just a start-up.. Is this another Nikola?**

No. This is very real, and yet Nikola‚Äôs market cap is somehow over 2x LM‚Äôs. [Recent confirmation](https://insideevs.com/news/490176/lordstown-motors-teases-beta-endurance-building/) by the CEO indicates that LM‚Äôs flagship Endurance truck is 97% ready, and will be [shown in action as a proof of concept](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-unveils-truck-for-race-in-mexican-desert/) in April. Production will begin this September ‚Äì the first ever electric pick-up truck to hit the road.

**How in the world will a company from small-town Ohio scale across the country?**

To help scale and increase a country-wide presence, [LM recently partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html). This partnership will allow LM to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US, with thousands of technicians and service bays, a 24/7 tech hotline and Good Sam‚Äôs Roadside Assistance Program, Lordstown Motors customers are expected to enjoy one of the most comprehensive EV support systems ever designed.

This partnership might not seem like a big deal on the surface, but it‚Äôs basically giving LM an instant country-wide presence for its customers at a tiny fraction of the cost that it would take to build their own service centers. This is HUGE.

**Anything else besides a truck?**

Two other vehicles have been officially announced: an [electric van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and an [electric RV](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34980821/lordstown-camping-world-electric-rv/) in partnership with Camping World.

**Areas for concern:**

This is pretty obvious. Some folks are skeptical because Lordstown Motors is a ‚Äústart-up‚Äù and will have to compete against larger companies. Analyst price targets range from as low as $18 to as high as $50.

But speaking of being skeptical, [I thought THIS TWEET from the Camping World CEO yesterday](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1365670229024645121?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) was interesting. He seems to be VERY confident in [what LM is doing](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).

**My position:**

950 shares. The CEO Steve Burns is a very intelligent man, and I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute. Most people don‚Äôt know that 17 years ago, [he developed the technology patents that were eventually used for Apple‚Äôs Siri](https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/).

**Final comment:**

I made this post to increase awareness for a company that I think is flying under the radar to most investors. There is also a really high short interest right now as the whole EV market has sold off. I think all of the shorts are about to get squeezed.

This information was made available to me by a personal friend who has a deep background in finance as well as a student at Stony Brook in NY for 3 years.

Disclaimer: I'm personally bullish on the stock just like everyone else is on this stock but I simply don't let things like ""I have a feeling it's going up"" or ""stonks only go up"" be a part of my mantra or analysis although most of you retards do.

The information I have available is from a 65 page financial and analytical report in regard to AMC that my friend made available to me that's only made available to students at Stony Brook and NYU who have access to the financial report database that accredited investors and business finance analysts regularly write in that rely heavily on the fundamental business analysis(dudes look to see if the company is good and give their opinion)

***Bullish Signals***

Figure 1: Institutional Ownership up 65% Institutions held 40.9 million shares at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional holdings in AMC Entertainment increased by 16,151,852 shares (65.3%) at the end of quarter ended Dec 31. Institutional ownership is now 71.0% of the issued capital. (**More institutional investors who are smarter than the average fuck face on WSB see fundamental/intrinsic value in a company that otherwise would go unnoticed since AMC is widely regarded as a dying company**)

Figure 2: AMC Entertainment is ranked number 9 out of 12 listed commercial services companies in the United States with a market capitalization of $523.1 million. In the commercial services companies it has the 3rd highest total assets and 2nd highest revenues.**(This information directly conflicts the bearish sentiment on most bearish analysis that AMC as far as assets and revenues doesn't do enough to stay alive from year to year)**

Figure 3: Quarterly Report (Q3/2020): November 04, 2020 Quarterly Report Analysis Q3 2020: AMC Entertainment reports 532% sequential rise in Quarterly Revenue AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), announced total revenue of $120m for the quarter-ended 30 September 2020 \[Q3/2020\], up 532.3% from the previous quarter \[Q2/2020\] and down 90.9% from the year-earlier period \[Q3/2019\]. Quarterly Report (Q3 2020) Compared with the Previous Corresponding Period \[PCP; Q3/2019\], year-over-year \[y.o.y.\] Revenue was down 90.9%. Read more in SECTION on Financials Q3 2020, FY 2019, Past 7 Years **(This information directly suggests that although AMC struggled in the past that it was making encouraging signs of growth)**

Figure 4: Rising Relative Strength: The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 81 in the NYSE market of 1,808 stocks, 273 units and 111 preference stocks which means it is beating 81% of the market. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ A price rise combined with a high relative strength is a bullish signal. ‚Ä¢ Also, the relative strength percentile is rising at 81 for 6 months, 98 for 3 months and 100 for 1 month. **(This for me IMO is the most apparent bullish signal in regard to AMC because it directly reflects the public sentiment towards the company itself &amp; what I mean about public sentiment is institutional investors and retail traders giving the stock price substantial growth since the pandemic)**

Figure 5: The debt to equity ratio of 7.4% is under a safe benchmark figure of 50%. Moreover, it has improved from 40.1% a year ago.

Years Debt to Equity (%)

Dec 2019 7.38

Dec 2018 40.08

Dec 2017 31.54

Dec 2016 220.76

Dec 2015 130.93

**(companies should aim for a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.0, meaning that the firm holds an equal balance of debt to equity. In a perfect world, though, a low debt-to-equity ratio - say, 0.30 - is better, as it indicates the firm has not accumulated a lot of debt and doesn't have to face onerous loan/credit interest payments, which is always good for the corporate bottom line. Lenders and investors tend to favor companies that demonstrate they're using less leverage and that they hold a more solid equity position.**

**Obviously, a business wants its income to exceed its liabilities. But if that doesn't happen, and debt exceeds assets, that's a big red flag for a company (especially a smaller, newer one) and could mean a company can't pay its debts.**

**That's why, when evaluating a company's overall financial health, and its debt burden, a debt to equity is a due diligence necessity for a company, and needs to be constantly measured.)**

Figure 6: Revenue growth has shown signs of recovery in recent quarters.

Jun 20 \[Q2 vs Q1\] (Revenue Growth) -98% (Net Profit Margin)-2,969.3%

**(This reiterates my observations from earlier claiming that AMC has had positive growth it still has struggled to do so.. The reason as to why is debatable for instance most people say it's because their business model is outdated and hasn't strived to innovate as far as experience &amp; service provided)**

US Equity Market is roughly 33 Trillion Dollars. US Bond Market in 2017 was around 44 Trillions USD (lets inflate that to 60 Trillion in 2021). 

The treasuries amount to roughly 40% of that, which is 24 Trillion. During last month's Treasury sell offs (and hence, increased rates) would have handed Bond Investors some 3.3 Trillion in cash on hand. 

Since, the story is hope of exploded pent up demand and faster than expected vaccinations, they will want to move the cash to equities for higher risk/returns. That means, 3.3 Trillion will start flowing to economy in some form. Given that S&amp;P is 80% of US Equity (0.8\*33 = 26.4 Trillion), we can expect some 2.64 Trillion (0.8\*3.3) to flow into S&amp;P making the valuation to be 33+2.64 = 35.64 Trillion. That's a 8% boost on S&amp;P Index.

499,Moderna (MRNA) DD ‚Äì Why a 60B Company is Still Undervalued,2021-02-28 17:51:02,"\*This will be my first DD post so let me know if you would like to hear about anything I didn‚Äôt touch on, or if you disagree on any particular points. Hopefully you find it useful!

**Overview**

This is going to be a long post, so I‚Äôm not going to waste your time by explaining who Moderna is. They‚Äôve been in the news for the last year and everyone and their mother knows what they‚Äôve accomplished. They (along with Pfizer/BioNTech) are the big dogs when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination in the U.S., and their dominance in the market will likely continue.

But Moderna isn‚Äôt just a COVID-19 vaccine company, as their CEO repeatedly stressed in their most recent earnings call. Moderna is a true pharmaceutical giant in the making. They are currently developing 24 different products ranging from viral vaccines, to treatments for autoimmune disease, to cancer and heart disease therapeutics.^(1) The vast majority of these modalities are using mRNA technology to attempt to accomplish the desired effect. Not so coincidentally sharing the same name as Moderna‚Äôs ticker, mRNA technology is a relatively new modality that is just beginning to take hold as a game-changer in the biotech/pharma space. Let‚Äôs talk a little more about it so we can understand why it has the potential to create a major-shake up in the pharmaceutical industry.

**History of mRNA Technology**

mRNA was discovered in the 60‚Äôs in mice, but it wasn‚Äôt seriously considered for a possible therapeutic target until the 90‚Äôs. Various studies in vitro and in mice since this period have been done, demonstrating potential for the treatment of HIV, cancer, degenerative disease, autoimmune disease‚Ä¶ I could go on. As we know, pharmaceuticals move slowly, and serious development of these products didn‚Äôt really take off until the 2010‚Äôs.^(2)

Prior to December 2020, there were only two medications utilizing mRNA technology that have received FDA approval. Inotersan and Patisiran were both developed and FDA approved in 2018 to treat a rare hereditary condition called hATTR which involves pathologic deposition of amyloid into the tissues of those affected. Without going into too much detail, this condition has a mean survival time of 15 years after diagnosis and leads to significant patient morbidity and suffering in the interim. Inotersan is the more successful of the two drugs and looks to be potentially curative for some patients with a disease which used to be a death sentence. Routine imaging since the phase III trials for Inotersan shows little to no progression of the disease in most patients, laying out the possibility that these patients may live a normal life moving forward.^(3)

With two more successful examples of mRNA technology being used in the COVID-19 vaccines, I expect that interest in the technology will skyrocket and subsequently so will funding and development.

**First Mover‚Äôs Advantage**

This will be a short section; Moderna is THE biggest player in developing mRNA therapeutics. There are other companies like BioNTech, CureVac, Gradalis, and Ionis, and of these only BioNTech (BNTX) can compete in sheer breadth of product development as well as having a history of success. For the sake of time I won‚Äôt address the other companies, but a key advantage that Moderna has over BioNTech is that they have moved more quickly through their clinical trials than BNTX has. Outside of COVID-19, Moderna currently has 4 products in Phase II trials (with their CMV vaccine moving to Phase III very soon), while BNTX only has 1.^(4) Long term I believe both of these companies will be highly successful, but Moderna is a more mature company that will be seeing the fruits of their labors more quickly than their competitor(s).

**The Future of COVID-19 Vaccination, and Vaccination in General**

Moderna currently has about 60% market share, distributing 40M of the 70M total doses the U.S. has received. I expect that number to drop slightly, but I would expect that Moderna ends up vaccinating approximately 40% of all Americans when it‚Äôs all said and done, with Pfizer vaccinating a large chunk of the rest. After that, Moderna will likely shift distribution to other countries and deliver on their agreements abroad.

‚ÄúBut what about NovaVax, J&amp;J, and AstraZenica?‚Äù you might ask.

Without undercutting these companies and their potential, they are simply too late to the game in the U.S. to grab meaningful market share from Moderna and Pfizer.^(5,6) Johnson and Johnson was just recommended for authorization yesterday (2/26/2021) and will likely begin distribution in the coming weeks, however they are only expected to deliver 100M vaccines by the end of June. Moderna will deliver 300M by July^(7), on top of the approximately 40M they have already delivered. The U.S. has agreed to purchase more than 1.2B doses of the vaccine from a number of companies, but much of that will go overseas after American citizens have received their 2 doses.

Moderna is establishing relationships and trust globally with the successful development and distribution of their COVID-19 vaccine, but why is this important? Let‚Äôs think back to what the CEO said in their recent earnings call ‚Äì Moderna is NOT a COVID-19 company. Digging into their therapeutics pipeline, we can see mRNA candidates targeting Influenza, Cytomegalovirus, Nipah Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Epstein-Barr, Zika, Chikungunya‚Ä¶ Relationships established during this pandemic will serve them well in the development and distribution of future vaccine candidates like those listed above.

WAIT there‚Äôs more: back in January, Moderna announced plans to create a combination Influenza/COVID-19 vaccine, with the possibility of adding more candidates to the mix if they were to receive approval. With the number of viruses that they are targeting, Moderna has the potential to become the leader in vaccination globally, period. Their ability to create combination vaccines targeting a host of common viruses could be the new standard in vaccination. Certain candidates like RSV, CMV, and EBV are likely to become standard vaccinations given in childhood like other vaccines we are familiar with such as MMR and Varicella.

The potential of this company in the vaccination industry is endless, and right now they are just scratching the surface.

**Future Revenue Projections ‚Äì $18 Billion --&gt; ???**

During their most recent earnings call, Moderna reported that they have orders for their vaccine totaling $18 billion^(8), and they are expecting more orders throughout the year. The COVID vaccine market is likely to cool off a little after that, but experts currently predict that COVID-19 boosters will become a routine part of care in the future, likely needing a new dose every 2-3 years.^(9) Now this would likely represent a major hit to revenue if Moderna was just a COVID-19 vaccine company but once again, they are not.

Lets briefly talk about a virus you may have never heard of before ‚Äì cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is something you‚Äôve likely had in the past and didn‚Äôt know it, so why is it a problem? Oddly enough, this seemingly benign little virus causes about 25,000 birth defects per year in the U.S. Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 1000 babies will be born with a birth defect due to CMV.

Currently there is no vaccine, but do you know who has the most promising candidate that is already enrolling participants for phase III trials? You guessed it ‚Äì Moderna. The addressable market for this vaccine is conservatively estimated at $2-5 billion/year.^(10) I expect that if it is approved by the FDA that it will likely see global adoption and that revenue number is likely to be much higher.

Repeat the above for RSV, EBV, Zika, etc. and it is not hard to envision a company that is bringing in $30-50 billion a year in annual vaccination income alone. If they were to succeed in any of their more lofty quests to develop an HIV vaccine, or therapeutics for autoimmune hepatitis, or personalized cancer vaccines‚Ä¶ the sky is the limit.

**Justifying Current Valuation, and Then Some**

Moderna‚Äôs current market cap is 62.16B. Their orders for 2021 currently exceed $18B with room to grow. The average revenue multiple for a biotech company is between 6-8x, and Moderna is trading at less than 4x. If you consider Moderna a pharmaceutical company, than the average multiple would be about 5x, still under.^(11)

I know we are looking at unrealized revenue with Moderna at this point, as that $18B will be earned throughout the year, so I understand that technically speaking they are still trading at an obscene P/S ratio compared to other more mature companies. However, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that demand for their product isn‚Äôt going away anytime this year and they have proven that they are able to execute and even exceed expectations when it comes to manufacturing and distributing their product.

Looking at their most recent earnings report for Q420 which was released on 2/25/21, their balance sheet is stellar. They are holding around $3B in cash from recent deposits, and they have almost no debt to speak of.

Simply put, they are undervalued at their current price. Without even factoring in the potential of everything else in their pipeline, they should be worth more as just a COVID-19 company with stellar financials and a relatively palatable multiple going into the later part of this year.

My personal price target: $220/share. With 396M outstanding shares, a $220 share price would place Moderna at $87B, which I believe to be a fair valuation through this year. This would represent a 4.8x multiple to their projected revenue in 2021. This represents a 41% increase in price from where Moderna is trading at currently which is \~$155/share.

**Closing**

Understand that this company has enormous potential for growth, but also potential to fail. Most pharmaceutical products fail in clinical trials before ever reaching market, and the same could be true for most if not all of Moderna‚Äôs pipeline. I personally believe that mRNA products have a higher chance of success than traditional therapeutics, but I‚Äôm not going to go into my reasoning for that in this post.

Every trade carries risk, and the risk with buying Moderna is that the market for COVID-19 vaccines shrinks as the world gradually develops herd immunity, the rest of their products fail in clinical trials, and they die a slow death without ever bringing another product to market. Nonetheless, I am confident and hopeful that this will not happen, and Moderna will become the next company to join the ranks of Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, and company as a true juggernaut of the biotech/pharma sector.

500,"The Yield Curve and You, A Primer",2021-03-01 00:28:44,"TLDR up front for the smooth brains: low fed rate make inflation, inflation make long term bond prices go ouchy, so short long term bonds as a hedge against inflation and collect your tendies.

Tldr;Tldr: Buy TMV

In depth for grown ups:

Low fed rate = borrowing money is easy/cheap = public companies boom = the stock market booms = long term treasury bonds must increase yield to remain a viable investment = long term treasury bonds must decrease price to increase yield= TMV 3x leveraged bear 20+ year treasury bond ETF will print until the fed rate is hiked back up.

So how does the yield curve fit into this? Basically it‚Äôs all about what the 10 year treasury yield is doing. If it‚Äôs much higher than the 2 year yield, then the curve is STEEPENING which means there is inflation risk. Which it‚Äôs starting to do now. 

Are we at risk for a market crash? Not really right now. Out of the past 13 major market crashes, the yield curve has been INVERTED for several weeks and this pattern has become one of the most important forward looking indicators of an impending crash. Right now it‚Äôs going in the opposite direction.

So, yield curve STEEP and UPHILL (right now)? Stocks are doing great but inflation is a problem. Keep buying your stocks but also short long term bonds for extra tendies. Throw some cash into commodities if you want to feel like a smart warren buffet boomer.

How about yield curve FLAT or DOWNHILL or INVERSED? (Not now) Crash incoming. sell all your ARKK shares, be really nice to your boss while praying to whatever diety you believe in that you won‚Äôt be ripped away from your wage slave job, make sure you call and see if your parents still have your childhood bedroom available so you have somewhere to go after your wife and her boyfriend force your worthless ass to move out.

503,Is the TESLA #TSLA Hype over or we are heading to new Highs soon?,2021-02-28 17:47:40,"Last week was a good week for all the Tesla sceptics who are waiting for the so-called ""Hype"" to be over and the price to drop. But are they right? Let's look at some of the macro and micro trends and let's see where the share price could be possibly heading.

**1. Macro:**

* In the US, Biden has made it clear that the EV boom is just getting started. This means, that those who are already ahead of the curve are in a very strong position.
* He made it clear that we are going to see a major shift, stating he plans to replace the entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles.
* That includes 245,000 in various federal agencies‚Ä¶ 225,000 in the United States Postal Service‚Ä¶ and another 173,000 in the military.
* That adds up to a grand total of 643,000 cars, trucks, and vans set for an upgrade on the U.S. government‚Äôs dime.¬†
* Also across the world, more countries are following or have already started.
* For example, Norway imposed several changes in the government years ago just like the United States, and it‚Äôs led to a sweeping transformation.¬†
* In fact, 54% of all vehicles sold in the country last year were electric vehicles.

**2. Micro:**

* Tesla's forecast in terms of deliveries is looking very promising.
* Deliveries are expected to rise from about 500,000 last year to 894,000 this year and 5 million by 2024. By 2030, annual deliveries could climb to about 9 million.
* This is mainly due to increased efficiencies in the production and new productions plants being built in China, Germany and Texas
* Some analysts also expect that Tesla could be generating 37bn free cash flow by 2025; just as a comparison Facebook is currently generation 23bn.

To summarise: Before any sceptics get too happy, Tesla is still a very much hold for us and some well-known analysts even anticipate the **price to head towards $1200 next year**.

What do you think? Agree or disagree? "

Perfect way to hedge against market crash is what I read, plus it's the sauce on top of GME causing market wide volatility.
Why would I not like my GME tendies with VIX sauce? 

My order for monday: 
-VIX 80 Call 17MAR21 @ $0,20
-VIX 110 Call 17MAR21 @ $0,05
wil update with positions once order has gone through.

By the way, I noticed how the same VIX calls are like 4x as expensive in April compared to March. Is this possible hedging by funds for the disaster to come? 
Are there any reasons to believe that the market goes nuts especially in April compared to march? 
I know that DFV's GME calls expire in April; would they be expecting the distaster to come by then? 

Wil a geomagnetic reversal happen in which Earth's magnetic poles switch, causing our Earth to not be shielded from solar flares and high velocity charged particles (would probably cause some nice volatility)

- weakening dollar
- covid demand/supply structural mismatch (similar to semiconductor dynamics, or any consumer electronic company like gaming or cameras etc).
- chronic underinvestment in commodity production assets for 10-20 years 
- rising rates
- inflation thesis, or tail % change of hyperinflation
- Hot economies globally (5-6% US GDP growth, 11% India, I dunno about China or Europe).
- Synchronized global response to post covid nation-building (a la WWII) but perhaps even bigger and more global. I think this one is under appreciated in magnitude.
- global green energy transition requires a pull forward of raw material input
- global EV transition requires a pull-forward in material input.
- global housing boom (desire to own vs rent + urban exodus, remote work. Millennial demo coming into home buying globally) requires a massive pull forward in raw materials inputs.

516,How to Grow a Meme Stock Portfolio,2021-02-28 21:44:48,"I don‚Äôt want to waste anyone‚Äôs time, so if you‚Äôre only trading with the remains of your stimulus check, close this post now. Sorry, you just don‚Äôt have the proper capital to play. Ideally, you need at least $2k for this strategy to be worth your time.

Now that we got that out of the way, let‚Äôs dive in!

The first thing you need to do is learn how to use the Poor Man‚Äôs Covered Call (PMCC) strategy. PMCCs are a leveraged version of traditional CCs. All you do is buy LEAPS and sell short dated calls against it. We use LEAPS because they mimic 100 shares of a stock and you can usually get them 30-50% cheaper than buying 100 shares. You leverage junkies should really like that.

Next, pick your favorite meme stock and start your PMCC. This alone is a highly profitable strategy because meme stocks have high IVs, so you‚Äôll be collecting a lot of premium on the calls you sell. Don‚Äôt get overly excited yet, you‚Äôre not going to become a millionaire from doing this alone. There‚Äôs still one more step.

I know, I‚Äôm putting too much stress on your small attention span. It‚Äôs okay though, we are on the final step. Once you have a decent amount of cash built up from the premium you‚Äôve been collecting, you can either open up another PMCC on the meme stock you‚Äôre currently using, or open a PMCC for another meme stock. If you‚Äôve done this properly, you‚Äôve now doubled your premium intake.

You just keep doing this strategy over and over again, letting your portfolio get loaded with the latest meme stocks. Before you know it, you‚Äôll have a piece of every meme stock!

If your brain at least half functions, I‚Äôm sure you can see how this strategy is so powerful. You get to build a massive portfolio full of meme stocks ready to moon for free! All of your new meme stocks are paid for by previously purchased meme stocks. On top of that, you have a steady and ever increasing stream of cash flowing in from premium. 

Go ahead and tell your wife‚Äôs boyfriend all about it. Prove to him that you‚Äôre the smartest autist around.

Edit: Please ignore the comments from LanoLikesTheStock. The user spewed a ton of false information about the strategy due to his/her lack of understanding.

517,Trends consensus and you,2021-02-28 21:28:42,"Okay so short little tidbit from a vet member. Last year around this time wsb was hard on the spy 200p wagon (myself included) we saw circuit breakers multiple days and got drunk on our own bias and it all made so much sense at the time I mean we had variationseperate our profit wcgw. As you know a ton of us got smoked me especially in ulta puts (I'm a retard). This whole gme situation has changed in January it was a different beast now there is such a strong mob mentality that the shorts have to squeeze but realize what has actually happened.

Both large run ups were started by large whales purchasing a huge volume of high delta calls. The first was then extended by a social media rally. The main reason this rally died was due to a large volume of call options closing out and locking in profit. When a call is closed the market maker will sell the previously held shares they bought to hedge thier delta, and freeing those up to be borrowed to short. 

Do I think it will run again? Sure but be warned each time it spikes calls will close and flood the market with shares, also put volume has jumped considerably which market makers purchase shorts to delta hedge these. Long story short wsb just dosnt have the capital currently to move this stock considerably and has been riding among whales as an easy media scapegoat. If you think well the 9 million here only have to own x shares, realize people rarely put thier money where there mouth is and are just watching for entertainment.

Tldr; be careful stock may pop but each time will be smaller and smaller unless some very large catalyst comes along to blow it up. Still like it long term but will wait for the hype to die down a bit in the next two weeks"
518,FHA housing mortgage delinquency rates.,2021-02-28 14:02:09,"So I was looking at mortgage delinquency rates, overall they have been dropping.....except for FHA and VA loans which are at all time highs.
My second point I would like some help on would be mortgages in forbearance.
I asked myself are loans in forbearance count towards mortgage delinquency rates and this is what I found.
     Borrowers in a¬†forbearance program¬†who have missed a mortgage payment are¬†included¬†in the CoreLogic¬†delinquency statistics, even if the loan servicer has not reported the loan as¬†delinquent¬†to credit repositories. ... Only servicers providing loan-level¬†forbearance¬†information were¬†included¬†in the analysis.
The last sentence has me worried.  Can we find out what services include this data as well as those that don't?
   I recall reading an article that stated the total amount of mortgages in delinquency that are in forbearance  are at 2/3. How can we verify this data. It's also a little hard to find articles about the FHA rates, it strikes me as odd seeing mostly news about the national average going down. I feel that the most important home buyer metric would be new buyers. If almost  15% of new home buyers are in delinquency those levels are coming close to 2008 levels at 22%. 

   How could I dig into this further. Hopefully places with hard data and no fluff.
I'm not saying housing crash, however I feel that this should be studied a bit.

Edit: messed up a couple words"
519,"Here's my opinion on most of the DDS, pretty interesting.",2021-02-28 12:24:58,"I woke up 5am today, because I was knocked out at 830 last night and writing to you guys now. Why is that relevant? Because I'm also one of the dumb apes in on this, reading reddit daily since the Jan 29th debacle. I decided to write this for many reasons, read if yall want. One of the reasons is I don't or can't talk to anyone right now about Gme for obvious reasons. ""sell that shit, the volume doesn't look right, well TV said this bla bla bla"" 

JUST FUCKING DIAMOND HANDS. Jesus christ buddha

No proof or DD just opinions. 

1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits. 

2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will. 

3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of ""making things up to profit"" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv. 

4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.

Below are just rants now. 

5. The squeeze is real. Read 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3

6. You ain't diamond hands unless you read like 20 DDs minimum a day. To be a diamond hand, don't worry about shills and all those short ladder attack, Silver, open court cases, short interests reports, dips, tweets etc, because read 1, 2 and 3. That's all you need to care about. 

7. The more I read DDs since early February, the more I bought in, like 3 times actually. 

8. To me in the beginning, this was not an investment but a BET. Hence wsB. But the bet payout was this:

A. In the beginning my head was, spend 10 dollars, you get 3 outcomes. You only lose maybe 1 to 3 dollars Max, if you bought low like 40 to 60 maybe. Ok we lose SOME money, just don't eat out next time or work an extra week or something for those of us fortunate to do so. Remember this is a BET. don't use what you can't afford. 

B. You break even and get your money back, GME ain't going bankrupt ever, read the DDs, Ryan Cohen and crew. Also read 1 2 and 3, it's in media now. 

C. With 10 dollars you make $1000 right? Win win? Nah dog, this payout is going to be 100k share +. Again read 1, 2 and 3. And now this went from a BET to an investment. Why? Because I don't bet what I can't win. I'm cheap like that. 

9. Now people are day trading. To me it's like buying a 20 dollar scratch ticket to win 40 dollars. Then betting and buying more scratch ticket hoping you win, yall gonna sell and miss the squeeze guys, read 1 2 and 3 HODL. OR you can buy a 1 dollar scratch ticket, HODL for a rainy day and win 100k or more, multiplier of other apes holding too.

10. This is a once and lifetime opportunity. It's like going on let's make a deal TV show. You take the $2000 cash instead of picking what's behind curtain 1 2 and 3. Where in this case the curtain is certainly going to have alot more money and there's literally no zonks. Why? Read 1 2 and 3, that's why yall should HODL. 

This is a roller-coaster of a ride. It went from me wanting to screw hedge funds over to me paying off my cc debts, to me paying off my house to me retiring, to me now wanting to do philanthropy and open businesses to help the regular folk and change peoples lives. But you can't do that shit with 10k a share or even 100k a share. It needs  fuck you money. Let's ALL make fuck you money guys. Apes strong, thanks for listening. I have no one to share this ride with. Please don't block me. Good luck guys, stay safe. Get some fucking sleep and stop reading reddit so much and just watch the ticker, cuz it's going to blast off as long as we hold. Why? Read 1, 2 and 3.

This is not financial advice etc. Just observation and personal opinions. Im pretty sure there's real data out there from those conspiracy heads but I'm too lazy to prove it and you know, read #2. This could all also blow over and we make no profit and doesn't blast off cuz why? Read #2.

TLDR: companies caught with pants down doing shady things for profit. We found out, it's an opportunity for a squeeze. All you need to know is these guys will do whatever it takes to get away with it. Hold, don't sell low, no need to day trade, wait for the squeeze, and we all make fuck you money. Everything else isn't worth reading or worrying about. God speed.

520,$APHA shareholders stand to gain ‚Äúfree money‚Äù via the gap when the $TLRY deal closes,2021-02-28 17:25:38,"üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Aphria $APHA cultivates and sells medical and recreational cannabis through retail and wholesale channels in Canada and internationally. 



üöÄ On Dec. 16, Aphria and Tilray $TLRY announced a merger to form the largest cannabis company in the worldby revenue. The company will keep the Tilray name, including the ability to consolidate production in Canada, combine alcohol and CBD businesses in the United States in preparation for potential federal legalization, and the ability to combine efforts in Europe.



üöÄ In a reverse merger structure, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria
share, implying a 23% premium to Tilray‚Äôs share price before the announcement. Given relative sizes,
Aphria shareholders will own about 60% of the combined company and get seven of the nine board
seats. Tilray CEO and Chairman Brendan Kennedy will get one of Tilray‚Äôs two board seats, while Aphria
CEO and Chairman Irwin Simon will keep both roles in the combined company.



üöÄ Its pending merger with Tilray boosts its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Deal terms seem fair to both sides. Aphria added recreational cannabis after Canada‚Äôs legalization in October 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Aphria‚Äôs recreational and wholesale cannabis revenue accounted for roughly 41% of total cannabis and distribution revenue. Unlike many of Aphria‚Äôs competitors that immediately focused on creating consumer packaged goods for the recreational market, Aphria initially focused on flower and vape. However, it is now beginning to expand into edibles.



üöÄ On Feb. 1, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Ron
Wyden announced their intentions to push major federal cannabis legislation. They plan to release a
discussion draft in the early part of this year. Legalization is likely going to take a couple of
years, as forecasts estimate a change to federal law by 2023. Nevertheless, legalization sooner than that
would unlock growth and capital access sooner but doesn‚Äôt change our estimated market potential of
$85 billion by 2030 compared with an estimated $15 billion in 2020, according to the Marijuana
Business Daily.



üöÄ Aphria has an extensive international distribution business, which generated the majority of net revenue in 2020, a far larger portion than many of its Canadian cannabis peers. The global market looks lucrative given higher realized prices and growing acceptance of the medical benefits of cannabis. Exportersbmust pass strict regulations to enter markets, which protects early entrants like Aphria.
Due to climate, much of Canada‚Äôs cultivation is in greenhouses or indoors. Recent expansions in outdoor production are likely limited to extracted products due to quality. Aphria revised plans to build
production in Colombia due to high capital costs, instead exporting global medical markets from its
Canadian facilities. 



üöÄ Forecast estimate roughly 16% average annual growth through 2030 for the global
medicinal market excluding Canada and the U.S.
Aphria's 2020 acquisition of SweetWater, a U.S. craft brewery, still leaves it out of the U.S. THC or CBD
market. Its strategy appears to predict that future cannabis distribution looks more like alcohol or tobacco than the current multi-state operator strucure of today. The U.S. offers the fastest growth of any market globally. However, the regulatory environment is murky with individual states legalizing cannabis while it remains illegal federally.  Federal
law will eventually be changed to allow states to choose the legality of cannabis within their borders.



TLDR;; 
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
Aphria's merger with Tilray grows its Canadian market share, expands its international capabilities, and adds U.S. CBD operations. Aphria‚Äôs focus on strategic SG&amp;A spending and running a lean business model allows it to have a healthy cash balance to fund future operations and investments. Aphria's careful approach to expansion has allowed it to reach profitability faster than any of its Canadian peers."

My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they‚Äôve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation. 

As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they‚Äôre trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they‚Äôre selling off their valuable possessions. So they can‚Äôt borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they‚Äôre selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don‚Äôt give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost. 

The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves. 

Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they‚Äôll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that‚Äôs my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov‚Äôt. Not only that but now they‚Äôre on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I‚Äôm sorry.

TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities. 

My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I‚Äôd be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn‚Äôt financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks."

535,Investing in Uranium/Nuclear Energy - Constraints to Consider,2021-02-28 17:23:26,"I've been seeing a lot of Uranium bull cases on WSB, r/investing, and r/stocks. A main point that keeps getting repeated is Biden = clean energy; nuclear = green energy; nuclear energy investment = sure thing. Unfortunately, I don't think it's quite that simple.


Here are some points you may want to consider before YOLOing all your money. I'm not taking either a bull or bear position, but wanted to lend insight about the industry with my family of Reddit degenerates so we can help each other make money.


Nuclear power is a very productive source of energy globally and, unlike with fossil fuel combustion, its use does not increase greenhouse gas emissions or contribute to acid rain. It is safer to mine than coal, but reactor meltdown and contamination from breached nuclear plants are significantly more hazardous (e.g. Chernobyl, Fukushima Daiichi). In addition, the problem of high-level radioactive waste management has confounded us for decades, and government efforts to address the negative production externalities of nuclear power are a demonstration of spectacular bureaucratic failure. 


Radioactive waste cannot be treated to make it nonradioactive, and thus storage is (currently) the only option. To my understanding, all radioactive waste produced by commercial power plants in the United States are currently in temporary storage, many of which are near capacity. We do have the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ([WIPP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_Isolation_Pilot_Plant)) in New Mexico for transuranic waste produced by our government during the creation of nuclear weapons; more than 3.7 million cubic feet of transuranic waste has been received by that facility (about half of its 6.2 million cubic feet capacity), but the site remains dedicated to defense-related radioactive waste containment. Further contributing to our nuclear waste management problem is fact that we do not reprocess our spent commercial reactor fuel elements (unlike France, China, Russia, Japan, and India), and thus create more waste than necessary. 


Improper waste storage is both a safety hazard and extremely costly to clean up as evident by the Hanford, Washington radioactive [waste leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanford_Site). An estimated one million gallons of liquid waste escaped from containers in Hanford, with some entering into the Columbia River. The Department of Energy (DOE) spends about $2-3 billion per year on cleanup efforts at the site, but bioremediation, chemical stabilization, storage transfer, and soil decontamination are expected to take many decades and cost over $110 billion. 


The [Nuclear Waste Policy Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Waste_Policy_Act) of 1982 intended to establish two commercial waste disposal sites - one in the west and one in the east of the United States (to be determined by DOE) - and formed the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which instituted the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF), supported largely by spent-fuel fees on waste generators and a 0.1 cent per kw-hour surcharge on nuclear powered electricity. To date, over $44 billion was paid into NWF ($750 million annual revenue) to finance disposal site identification costs and over $10 billion has been spent on this effort. 


In 1986, after years of research (considering factors of climate, population density, low regional water table, seismicity, et al.), DOE proposed three potential western area locations for permanent nuclear waste storage: Hanford, WA; Yucca Mountain, NV; and Deaf Smith County, TX. Unsurprisingly, all three states (and Tennessee) protested the nominations. In late 1987, Congress finalized [Yucca Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository) as the selection. Yucca Mountain was already on federally owned land and partially overlaps the Nevada Test Site (used previously for nuclear weapons testing) in Nye County. Despite millions from the NWF in compensation packages offered to the state for hosting high-level waste disposal, the designation and effort still faces bipartisan opposition.    


Yucca Mountain site characterization began in 1986, with the original projection estimating initial construction in 1998 and waste disposal beginning 2003. In reality, the site analysis and DOE‚Äôs environmental impact statement wasn‚Äôt completed/issued until 2002. DOE filed a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2008 to begin site development, with officials hoping for project completion in 2017. Twenty-seven years later, after many lawsuits, continued opposition from Nevada and environmental groups, and roughly $10 billion spent from when Nuclear Waste Policy Act first began formal efforts to create a permanent disposal system for nuclear waste, the Yucca Mountain project **was ultimately suspended under the Obama administration**. Increased regulatory expectation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2008 further complicated progress toward disposal site design and execution. Back in 1985, the EPA specified that high-level waste was to be confined in a manner that results in fewer than 1,000 fatalities over 10,000 years, which is the predicted rate with unmined uranium ore; the timetable for isolation is now extended to 1 million years.  


With global climate change and pressure to produce more CO2-neutral energy, nuclear power remains an important contributor of global power production (especially for countries with limited access to their own supplies of fossil fuels). Unfortunately, the lingering radioactive byproducts and safety hazards from compromised reactors are externalities for everyone outside of the industry, including those who live in areas not serviced by nuclear power. 


I guess, to be fair, no other nation has a permanent storage facility solution established for their nuclear waste either, so it appears that we are all stuck in this radioactive waste management dilemma together‚Ä¶ except maybe Finland. The [Onkalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository) spent nuclear fuel repository is under construction and anticipated to be operational in 2023 (barring additional setback). The risk of radioactive waste discharge and contamination from impaired permanent containment facilities are also externalities for current and near-future human civilization and whatever mutant race/creatures outlive us. (Hopefully they understand our primitive radioactive warning symbols.)


TL;DR - Nuclear power is a great clean energy source but its growth and adoption is constrained by waste storage.


Good luck to everyone with your investments. I hope we're all rolling in green portfolios and unrealized/realized gains again soon.


Positions: None in **any** energy category (fossil fuels, nuclear, or renewables)





Edit: Position information - expanded to clarify that I am not holding in a competing source; additional note below.





**Why did I even bother writing up the above?**
Answer: My paternal bloodline is notorious for extreme betting and poor financial decisions. Examples: my dad lost 70% of his 401k in bananas - I'm not sure if he bought Chiquita banana stock or futures, but my parents almost got divorced over it and my mom still brings it up to this day. Five of his siblings decided to file for bankruptcy in the span of 2 years as a brilliant plan to buy goods and then not pay for it. My dad's formerly wealthy cousin was so addicted to gambling that his wife and kids nearly left him. His solution was to get his wife hooked on betting too, which she did, and then they lost their house and had to live in a car. My birth family lost all of our meager savings in the stock market dotcom crash because they had no idea what they were doing and just followed trends without DDs. When I read about u/TheEmperorofJenks and his agricultural futures disaster, I called my dad and asked if he had invested in ornamental gourds. He hung up on me. Most of us know WSB is meant to be fun with occasional gems, but with the constant media coverage, we are getting a lot of new users who may lose lots of money trying to find the next rocket. I grew up having to live with the consequences of bad bets, so I'm reclaiming some time to offer a piece of my singular brain wrinkle. 


The long write up is because I was trying to ELY5 for anyone completely new to the sector. If your portfolio is 100% nuclear energy, I genuinely hope it takes off and makes you lots of money. I'm just trying to give another angle so people understand some of the potential hurdles before they go balls deep thinking they've got a sure shot to millions. Invest in whatever you think is a good idea (nuclear power **is** good tech) ‚Äê just research thoroughly, don't over-leverage yourself, and absolutely avoid making your kids suffer by throwing good money after bad."
536,Something Very Big Is Happening - PSLV DD,2021-02-28 18:11:08,"**A post not about GME? Yes, but wait!**

I like GME too and check every day to see if it's on the moon. But I urge you to take a moment to look at some stuff you might have missed. Something very big is happening right in front of us. 

This is not a *this or that* situation. I've been in that ""everything that's not a GME post is a distraction"" mode too. I know what it's like. I just want to be aware of what has been happening outside of GME. I just want you to **pay attention**.

&amp;nbsp;

I want everyone to be able to comprehend what is happening. We all have varying levels of attention spans, so I am going to break this down for 3 types of people:

**FOR WRINKLY üß†'s THAT CAN READ:**

[The silver short squeeze is glaringly obvious to anyone paying attention to the data, the evidence is overwhelming, just take a look for yourself, PSLV](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/)

This is the best DD since the original GME DD. A *must-read*, if you can.


&amp;nbsp;

**FOR üçø NETFLIX &amp; CHILL:**

[Hidden Secrets of Money ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10375812/) is a 10 part mini-series on Youtube. Even just the first episode highlights the absurdity of the situation. This gives the foundation for the magnitude of what we're dealing with.

&amp;nbsp;

**FOR ü¶ç WHO JUST WANT TENDIES:**

Just type ""PSLV"" into the search bar. Look at the first thing that comes up: 
https://imgur.com/ACOfwCm 

Even fucking Google is telling you this PSLV is üöÄüöÄüöÄ

You can't make this shit up.

&amp;nbsp;

In all seriousness, you should really read the [PSLV DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/) and come back. This is an extremely disturbing finding and the only reason it didn't garner more attention is that it was deleted then undeleted after it wasn't on the front page.

Now put 2 and 2 together and consider layer what this DD is uncovering on top of the currency situation. [This](https://preview.redd.it/rxuo34jiqd561.jpg?width=1610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e096a718cda81fbc7ac4ecf161fe2ea3d7d55b2) is the amount of money being created. **35% of all US dollars in existence have been printed in the last 10 months.**

I want you to come to your own conclusions here. It should be exceedingly obvious that something big is happening.

As /u/TheHappyHawaiian's [graph](https://preview.redd.it/pk37q11tkmi61.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddd64a50dfc58bf0f5a118951096f7dda5f5c69) shows, the elite are already buying up silver at an incredible rate. So this is probably happening with or without Reddit. But the price of may able to stay suppressed without anyone sounding the alarm for a while.

Except the difference now is, **YOU**. You retards are capable of some amazing things.

Remember that scene from The Big Short where they investigate the housing market by actually checking themselves what was happening down-low? https://streamable.com/2hxpy9

Recently, a silver break-out of wallstreetbets starting urging everyone to start collecting physical silver. They've been calling their local shops, asking if they have any silver, and the shops are all out. Any silver that is remaining is immediately bought up. I urge you, go call your local shop and check if they even have any silver. Turns out most are completely OOS, and go OOS immediately on any new shipments.

If GME shows us anything, it's that decentralized communities are good at exposing bullshit. This starts from the ground-up. You cannot artificially suppress the price of something that is so rare it cannot be obtained.

*Why silver? Why not Gold or some other metal?*

Please see [What's Wrong With This Picture? -  Precious Metals DD](https://www.removeddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpqzsg/whats_wrong_with_this_picture_precious_metals_dd/) (which as also deleted from the wallstreetbets subreddit).

&amp;nbsp;

*PSLV vs. SLV?*

PSLV - You buy their shares, they buy and hold physical silver stored on your behalf. This is regularly audited and you can even go trade in your shares for silver bars if you want.

SLV - You buy their shares, and they *promise* to hold silver. They pinky swear guys!

^‚Äé

^^*Techniquely ^^there ^^is ^^no ^^definitive ^^proof ^^of ^^SLV ^^being ^^fraudulent, ^^but ^^purchasing ^^SLV ^^instead ^^of ^^PSLV ^^is ^^a ^^bit ^^like ^^using ^^Robinhood ^^to ^^purchase ^^GME. ^^If ^^you ^^don't ^^like ^^getting ^^screwed ^^over ^^the ^^choice ^^should ^^be ^^obvious.

&amp;nbsp;

*What's the risk?*

Silver is at the lowest it will ever get. You're buying in at the absolute floor.

2/3 ≥·µà's of the world's total silver has already been mined, and getting the last third is a slow process with diminishing returns. Meanwhile, it is becoming more and more used up in EVs and Renewable Energy. This is inherently deflationary. Silver becomes more precious over-time.

Each PSLV share represents 0.3691 Oz of silver. Your wealth is in a real store of value, while all fiat currencies are being printed at record rates. *Think about that for a moment*. 

If you've been stressed due to having all your money tied up in straight speculation, you can rest easy. This literally cannot go tits up.

&amp;nbsp;

*What's the upside?*

Even without a squeeze, silver climbs to its natural gold:silver ratio price of $112. Other naturalistic projections put silver at $182 by 2023.

In the *glaringly obvious* situation that  /u/TheHappyHawaiian's [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/) outlines, this causes a üöÄ the likes of which we've never seen before. ""*GME was an appetizer. Silver is the entree.*""

And, if the culmination of all events (the 573% of the 'float`short squeezed, the price suppression revealed, the rapid inflation realized) comes to fruition, this transcends every other stock and USD entirely. The monetary system as we know it dramatically changes.

538,Is NIO ready to skyrocket in 2021?,2021-02-28 19:06:53,"There are many EV manufactures in China (the largest EV market in the world) but NIO is one that always called my attention because of their design, innovation and sales volumes. This brought me to create a projection based on past deliveries, and noticed that  **NIO** might sell more cars in China this December than Tesla. It seems hard to believe but that's why I have attached a table with the raw data so you can do the projection by yourselves. Another point that I‚Äôve considered, was that when comparing January 2021 deliveries to last December, Tesla dropped 35% while **NIO** increased its deliveries by 3%. This is not a lot, but compared to January 2019 NIO increased an impressive 325%.

February **NIO**'s vehicles delivery which is supposed to go out next week will be key to confirm this trend. February of last year was a bad months for **NIO** given the Chinese New Year, and the pandemic. However, if **NIO** was able to deliver more than 1,000 vehicles in February 2021, then it should deliver more that 100,000 total cars in 2021, and maybe overtake Tesla in December as the top EV supplier in China. If achieved, this will mark a big milestone for **NIO**. Sure that 100,000 is shy of the 800.000 cars delivery expected for Tesla in 2021, but it took Tesla 6 years to reach 100,000 vehicles, while NIO might achieve this important milestone in it's forth year. It‚Äôs also important to mention that February is a slow month for car sales in China because of the new year celebrations, therefore all vehicles' manufacturers are expected to report lower sales than in other months.

Usually **NIO** announces past month‚Äôs car delivery at the beginning of the following month, so most likely next week we‚Äôll know how many cars were delivered in February 2021.

I owned 6,000 **NIO**'s shares, and after the price dropped last week I sold 1,000 of my **NIO** shares and bought 150 5 March 21 $50 Call Options with the proceeds.

**So what do you think, should I buy more, hold, or sell?**

While I was looking through studying up on my investments and how they work I stumbled upon this:

&amp;#x200B;

[Replicate Market Conditions?](https://preview.redd.it/51qw17a08ak61.png?width=1275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0073542e7d4313c145b8d9c3f6df8394a5d8142)

 

Etoro only replicates market conditions, meaning you don't actually own what you invest there, no real stake in the company. Now you may be thinking that only cfd labelled assets have that issue and shares bought cash only, no leverage, no shorting, just simply buying shares of a company to own. However, when you invest you have a minimum for stocks of 50$ per investment, no matter how small the price. This tells us that you don't necessarily have to buy in terms of shares, since almost every transaction is made in fractional shares. To me alarm bells are ringing already, why can I buy an exact amount of shares up until it goes below 50$? CRSR is under 50$ so I have to buy more than 1 share and fractional at that?

Look at the last line: If the position closes in profit, the broker pays the trader. If it closes at a loss, the broker charges the trader for the difference. At this point the only thing I can compare this to is a casino, albeit one that tracks the stock market, why? To me it sounds like when I earn a profit they pay me, but when I lose they charge me the difference EXCEPT THIS IS ALL ""REPLICATE MARKET CONDITIONS"", YOU DON'T OWN ANYTHING.

Humor me hear and tell me if I may be missing something. Here's my theory:

Let's assume Etoro is all replicated market conditions, even assets they claim to be real shares, all of it CFD. Now we know they have incentive to let us lose because THEY pay us if we win and WE pay them if we lose as stated by them, all in a virtual market place that imitates ""real market conditions"" but still not real, very much casino-like. They also have data on all trades and accounts in their servers. So where's the catch? Remember all those periods of extended ""maintenance"" during coincidentally key market hours. Let's consider it's exactly an online casino, no shares are real, when you win they lose money and when you lose they gain money. So they have an incentive to make sure you lose money, how do they do this? STATS! They've got data on all the people investing in their platform, they don't have to catch all of you, just enough. So let's say they know 70% of their users have apple avg 120 and expected to increase this week to 135, but suddenly their servers have a ""sudden malfunction"" during prime hours and peak has left many people holding the bag again or having lost a better score/loss. They secure their money and got away with it because how would you prove that their computers didn't malfunction and were just shut off?

They've only gotten increasingly worse the last weeks, 3 in a row and 1 lasting a whole trading day. I can recall several instances trading AMD, AAPL, &amp; AMZN watching it peak and going to sell only to be sent to the maintenance page watching the support team shit out their messages saying the problem is being addressed, waiting literal hours sometimes for it to go back up. By the time it was ""fixed"" the market already dropped and I was left holding for another swing next week/month or selling for a meager profit. They used to post this phrase everywhere in their site, seemed legally mandatory ""over 85% of traders lose when trading CFDs"" it's gone now but it would make sense why people lose when your in a casino. ""The house always wins"" as they say.

Let me know if I missed anything and we can discuss further whether this may or may not be true. I'll also post this on r/etoro to see what they think. I'll also leave a link here for other reference in case people want to discuss more: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrbz4a/etoro\_has\_been\_an\_absolute\_clusterfuck\_lately\_be/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrbz4a/etoro_has_been_an_absolute_clusterfuck_lately_be/)"

Today we see a rebound from some dark days last week. The news is rapidly building with stimulus checks, central banks pushing inflation and private investors diving deep into indices. 
I think that we need to be careful what the recovery rates will be after our beloved (not) crisis. 
I think there is so much fresh cash entering the market that we continue to see higher highs upcoming weeks, but what will happen when we can move a bit beyond our current lockdowns is more scary and interesting.
Will private investors pull their money and start a selling frenzy or will they see the profits and extra dime as a ongoing event?

546,"(GME DD) Why the Volkswagen Comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought, but in A DIFFERENT WAY",2021-02-27 18:36:58,"Hey folks!
I‚Äôm not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I‚Äôve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we‚Äôve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.

Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I‚Äôm not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:

So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: ‚Äúwell, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101).
I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:




TL;DR:
You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.



Let‚Äôs explain that for those that don‚Äôt immediately get the logic.
Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:

you start with ~0~ shares
you borrow one from a broker
you now have ~1~ shares
you sell that share, completing your short
you now have ~0~ shares

Now imagine the short squeeze happens.
And let‚Äôs say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc.
The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).

Now here‚Äôs the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high:
Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital. 
You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.

you start with ~0~ shares
you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker!
you sell a ‚Äúshare‚Äù, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped ‚Äúsometime soonish maybe‚Äù
you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!

Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with! 
Thus, you can‚Äôt give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value: 

THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO
The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt squeezed yet?

Here‚Äôs where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME‚Äôs nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy.
Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.


If you‚Äôve gotten this far, congratulations.
Now think about that again.


Effective TL;DR 2.0:

People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule?
Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.

But here‚Äôs MY question:
What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it? 
VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it‚Äôs an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we‚Äôve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.


Please reflect on this and correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I hope I‚Äôm not.
Joy to all,

547,"When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next.",2021-02-27 23:13:01,"I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.

By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.

Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/

First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! 

Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. 

Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. 

By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.

Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.

When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.

UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!

Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.

Space Ape out

TLDR: 

* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU
* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI
* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot
* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds
* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon

The company is also benefiting from the transition to a software-based firm and its efforts to more efficiently deliver and scale its products.

¬†

In the quarter, government sales increased by 85% and commercial revenue grew by 4% year over year. While commercial growth was slower than anticipated, Palantir‚Äôs 2021 focus of expanding its direct sales force and channel partnerships to accelerate this segment. Palantir is showing strong momentum with growing sales and margins with its existing customer base, diversification among its revenue streams, and ability to land new clients. Average revenue per customer increased by 41% year over year to $7.9 million. Annual revenue from top 20 customers increased by 34% year over year to $663 million, while the customer concentration from those top 20 customers declined to 61%.from 67% the year before. Palantir closed more than 21 deals in the quarter worth at least $5 million, with 10 of those worth at least $10 million. Adjusted gross and operating margins of 84% (81% last quarter) and 32% (25% previous quarter), respectively, were ahead of our prior expectations as revenue outpaced expenses, Palantir lowered its cloud hosting costs, and go to market efficiency gains are decreasing upfront software deployment costs.




Palantir is well suited to help organizations consolidate and harness the power of data. Between a leading position in the government sector with the U.S. and its allies and the opportunity for Palantir to expand into commercial enterprise applications, this narrow-moat company is poised for robust growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. The uncovering of insights and the easy integration of data is a largely untapped market due to legacy data sets saved around the world, various data formats, the uptick in cloud-based resources, and the proliferation of the need for real-time access via distributed devices.¬†



Palantir established itself by working with the U.S. government intelligence and defense sectors to integrate military data into a consolidated dashboard, and then drove actionable outcomes by uncovering hidden patterns with artificial intelligence support. Its Gotham software platform is used across various government sectors within the U.S. and among its allies.



Palantir sells its Foundry software platform to commercial organizations, targeting large-scale data operations. Holistically combining data has typically involved consulting alongside in-house customized development efforts for enterprises; however, Palantir's commercial offering is attempting to change the industry's procurement motion. Its software is used in a variety of industries and Palantir's aim is to be the data operating system for companies and industries. By stitching together various seemingly disparate components of the airline industry, as one example, Palantir has made inroads to become a data platform standard for the industry, and looks to other industries to achieve similar results.¬†



Tldr;¬†

¬†Palantir could be the answer to the problems that governments and commercial customers face in successfully integrating large-scale, disparate data in a cohesive and coherent manner to gain insight and drive actions. Palantir has a strong government business and is diversifying into potentially higher-margin commercial markets; it could become the data operating system for companies and industries. The company has substantial margin expansion opportunities via improvements in deployment costsband by offering commercially available solutions to prospects.

563,Why Melvin and the other HF‚Äôs basically have no chance of winning...IMO!,2021-02-27 14:50:50,"There is only one answer as to how on Earth 140% shorting was allowed. This is due to the concept of naked shorting...

this in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don‚Äôt believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.

Why does this even matter? It‚Äôs because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the ‚Äòfailure to deliver‚Äô system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more... 

Think about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It‚Äôs because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn‚Äôt sell when it went down why? Well it‚Äôs simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. 

Now back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen‚Äôs and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF‚Äôs as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that‚Äôs our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it‚Äôs a great time to be alive!

And although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won‚Äôt be able to be deductible since it‚Äôs made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it‚Äôs corruption vs the people.

565,$AMC Cup and Handle Formation,2021-02-28 01:59:20,"So when the cup began forming, it retraced approximately 50% (which given the volatility is totally understandable).  The bottom of the cup was rather smooth, indicating a strong period of consolidation and accumulation.  The cup formation also began immediately after a new trend (the boom up), meaning it's a strong contender for a continuation of the previous trend if the cup completes.

In order for the cup to complete, the price needs to rise above the neckline, which is about $10-11 area.  If this happens, chartists and algo buyers will see the buy signal and volume should come in.

What time period are we looking at?  I'd say we have till Friday to get it to the neckline.  If enough contracts are executed Monday, we could see enough volume to get there.

There's also the issue of the gap to fill from the sell off from Feb 2.  The area ranges from $10-$15, giving us further reason for an increase in price.  If we do, the breakout in price should occur from there.

Positions: March 5 $15 calls and missionary with the HF's wife.

Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:

When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It‚Äôs for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I‚Äôll tell you fece-tossing apes.

RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself). 

$RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn‚Äôt already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November‚Äôs earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back. 

It didn‚Äôt work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here‚Äôs the thing. Rocket hasn‚Äôt used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT. 

**Shorts have to pay the dividend?**

Yes. If a stock in which you currently have a short position pays a dividend, you are responsible for the dividend on the shares you have borrowed. When the dividend is due, your broker will withdraw cash from your brokerage account equal to the amount of the dividend paid on the shorted shares.


**BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN‚ÄôT tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?**

GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I‚Äôll tell you. 

The reason Rocket hasn‚Äôt bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley AND the special dividend announcement). I assumed before the ER that they hadn‚Äôt bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner and dividend announcement is behind them, the $RKT can fire at will and is clear for take off üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November. 

Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner. Not to mention Rocket was already a popular stock among option traders but its share volume was low. This FAT dividend will motivate more investors to choose shares rather than options, which will help increase our chances of a breakout on volume. 

**BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:**

Don‚Äôt focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop‚Äôs ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to ‚Äúwait out‚Äù on this play. I‚Äôm not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who‚Äôs with me?



TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more üí¥ for more ü¶ç. More üí∞ = more üçå. Apes likey bananas üçå

572,"Insufficient, non-evidence based GME DD",2021-02-28 13:58:16,"After pouring through far more data than I really should be consuming on GME, I came to a few conclusions. I'll present my hypothesis first and let you all tear it to shreds:  


1. There won't be a squeeze until HFs are appropriately re-positioned from short to long, and won't just recover but profit. 
2. All of the (expensive) machinations witnessed thus far, such as naked shorting, trade halts, naked calls, etc. are only stalling for time allowing HFs to reposition.
3. When the squeeze happens, the narrative will be played in the press as ""retail beating wall street,"" when the reality is more like ""HFs and MMs illegally manipulated the market so they could blatantly steal money from issuing naked calls, and then after that game went stale they allowed the squeeze to make them trillionaires."" 
4. There's a chance the squeeze won't happen at all, and the HFs will continue to circle-jerk retail around, bleeding us for money on naked calls and dangling the dream of the moon in front of us. I didn't think it was possible to manipulate the price so effectively with no shares, but HFs have educated me on their antics.   


I'm evenly split on whether I actually think the squeeze will happen at this point, or whether HFs/MMs (citadelvin) will profit sufficiently from selling naked calls to keep the game alive. I don't have reliable data on how many calls Shitadel is selling per day; the best clarity I could get was this obscure figure saying that Shitadel does more volume than the NYSE. Without a Bloomberg terminal, I don't think I can find data more specific to GME calls sold daily. My estimate and my suspicion is that Shitadel is making at least enough money selling naked calls to finance melvin short selling activity, and probably more than that.   


Any newbies on this sub who invested for social justice reasons, please either buckle up or strongly re-examine your motivations for investing. You can make tons of profit in the market and do great good with your earnings. But don't fool yourself that you'll ""stick it"" to any HF who has, by now, already hedged the other side of a bad bet. If you stick with GME and win, take your earnings and make the world a better place. Or buy a Tesla. It's all the same to us, really. We're here for the sweet tendies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pattern recognition is my superpower, so it's taken me a little time to observe the process and see how things panned out. GME price didn't break out on Wednesday because of anything related to Fed liquidity, it was allowed to peak in order to drive up interest and call prices. This is the real play. Don't get played. The secondary value in allowing GME to peak is that it creates a sense of FOMO now in people who didn't sell. Even knowing this was a psychology play, I was surprised at how fast my animal brain jumped in saying ""but wait oooh shiney profits."" Do NOT underestimate how fast the paperhands FOMO will kick in when we hit $400 again. The HFs really have a handle on price manipulation, which should be illegal AF. But here we are.   


TL:DR:  Calls have turned into pump and dump and the primary profit goes to Shitadelvin. If you're new to options trading, definitely avoid."

&amp;#x200B;

Difference between Options and betting on a football game. Betting on a football game doesn‚Äôt affect the outcome. If enough people buy call options it can affect the outcome.

**Conclusion: Pro‚Äôs will BANG THE CLOSE on Thursday March 18th for April 1 Call options**

Apparently, the Pro‚Äôs are buying call option positions at the close somewhat near where the stock is trading (at the money) causing the market makers to delta hedge (estimated .66) and buy shares in the open market. For every contract (100 shares) the market makers sell at the money (near current price), they will need to hedge by buying about .66 (delta) shares on the open market. Buying pressure can increase the price sparking more interest (feedback loop).This is how the bet influences the outcome. This is the way.

The last two months they did it in the last trading week of the month. I‚Äôm thinking they could disguise their intent by executing their strategy the week before GME reports Q4 earnings. They haven‚Äôt been waiting til Friday so my guess is it would take place earlier maybe on Wednesday or Thursday. Friday the 19th is Quadruple Witching day so volatility in the overall market will be higher.

BANG THE FORUM would also fuel the rocketship. Hedge Funds are spying on the reddit forum (Point 2). They have programs to scrape every letter on this forum and calculate sentiment.  I could see them buying contracts and faking an increase in sentiment by posting the letters GME in a lot of replies so it looks like [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) are about to go gang busters on GME. If the letters GME show up in many post replies then everyone will be thinking that redditors are about to buy a lot of GME. The idiot hedge funds will go out and buy stock/options to front run the retail investor. If the [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) crowd also included ‚ÄúGME‚Äù in replies it could further fuel it as the Pro‚Äôs manipulate the market. This is the way.

[**Point 0: Movement in GME is repeatable (feedback loop)**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/25/nothing-specific-caused-gamestop-rally-says-strategist.html?&amp;qsearchterm=Nothing%20specific%20caused%20GameStop%20rally)

(click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)

Catalyst relatively simple (feedback loop)‚Ä¶.we started to tick up on Thursday and got above $50. THEN major option trades went off fueling the rocketship to the moon! Parabolic!!

2:58pm stock at $53, 750 contracts at $50 strike expire tomorrow (1 day) paid $6.85 (about $500k). Within 10 mins stock at $68 or so and not long later dropped to $60

3:27pm stock at $60.80, 400 contracts at $60 strike $7.75 (about $300k)

(Feedback loop) People on the other side of the trade (sellers of contracts) have to hedge and buy shares. Craziness will happen with only 20 minutes left to the close. All this from ONLY $800k in call option activity!! That‚Äôs nothing‚Ä¶.a little skeptical.

[**Point 1: SEC former regulator foreshadows next squeeze (End of March)**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/26/there-are-institutional-traders-behind-gamestop-frenzy-former-sec-regulator.html)

First Short Squeeze‚Ä¶. Last trading week of the January

Second Short Squeeze‚Ä¶. Last trading week of the February (not as many short sellers)

Projected Third Short Squeeze‚Ä¶. Last trading week of the March (huge month for trade, month and quarter end)

**Point 2: Hedge Funds spying on** [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)\*\*, use it against them\*\*

Investors (HF‚Äôs, Institutions, etc.) are paying service providers to spy on the forum and count everytime someone mentions Gamestop or the ticker. They are tracking the sentiment of the forum to front run the action. If you talk about Gamestop a lot and type in the ticker then each mention gets counted and if there is a significant increase then the HF‚Äôs may consider buying the stock and/or options to participate in any increase before it goes parabolic.

**Point 3: Q4 2020 earnings expected to be out in ‚Äúlate March‚Äù**

I expect the earnings date will be announced two weeks prior, so that puts you around March 8th Monday to March 11th Thursday. Earnings date probably between 23rd to the 25th, two weeks after the announcement of the date.

11/24/2020 (Tuesday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/08/2020 (Tuesday)

08/26/2020 (Wednesday) GME announces Q2 earnings release on 09/09/2020 (Wednesday)

05/28/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q1 earnings release on 06/09/2020 (Tuesday)

03/12/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q4 earnings release on 03/26/2019 (Thursday)

11/25/2019 (Monday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/10/2019 (Tuesday)

**Point 4: Options Cubed - GME is spring loaded for volatility**

The somewhat binary outcome of survive or die combined with a very credible activist investor (Ryan C.) is accelerated with material changes and establishing a better alignment with the secular tailwinds of gaming.

Buying call options is like an option on an option on an option, Options Cubed. For that reason, you would expect them to be priced accordingly. However, even after the first squeeze massively help by the short sellers, we sat in the $40-$60 range with out of the money call options price extremely cheap. As if they were normal options. Let‚Äôs see how cheaply someone is willing to sell a $70 call option if this stock tanks to the $50s next week.

**Point 5: Probability says buy April 1 Call options**

You don‚Äôt know when the parabolic moves will happen but the media clips above in point 2 suggest it will happen in the last week of the month. Since you don‚Äôt know when, the task is the following:

Detail Outcomes --&gt; Assign Probabilities (subjective) --&gt; Calculate Expected Value

Lets say next week GME drops to the $50-$60 range and out of the money call options are cheap like the aftermath of the first squeeze.

15x return --&gt; 10% chance of another move just simply to $100 (a $60 Strike call option would be worth about $45 to $60 with a stock price move to $100 again)

0x return --&gt; 90% chance we never get above $50 again

Expected Value = (15x \* .1) + (0x \* .9) = 1.5x return

On average a 50% return is expected. So if you think there is a greater than 10% chance of another move to $100 once it falls to the $50-$60 range then the expected return only goes up assuming you can get at least a 15x return on your contract."

Hello beautiful apes.

For those of you so smooth-brained that you've not heard of Uncle Bruce, then allow me to use my tastiest crayon to enlighten you. Stock Markets with Bruce has been a stalwart of the GME saga and the old silverback has been live streaming throughout the whole damn thing. The guy deserves all the support and praise you can give him.

Onto his DD, go to the youtube channel 'Stock Markets With Bruce' and view the video 'GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On! Stock Markets In Plain English'. I can't link it sadly.

**tldr**; Hedgefunds with short positions are buying 2x(numOfShorts) call options deep in the money to not only cover their short positions, but then end up long GME. There are more calls available than tradable stock (due to naked call contracts) and thus they can then join-in the diamond hand rocket while the Chicago Market Makers (options writers) have to scramble around trying to buy more stock than exists. All this while the newly longed HF's slowly leak shares to the MM's at ever increasing prices.

Does this mean the shorts are now coming in to bat for us? I'm more than happy for smart money to yeet this thing to the moon, I'm here for tendies, nothing more, nothing less.

If I've wrongly interpreted the DD and you've been triggered, first well done for watching Bruce's video, give him a thumbs up while you're there. Second, don't get angry at me, hate yourself for taking financial advice from an ape on the internet. P.S. If you are my wife's BF then I'm sorry... I don't know what for, I just am.

I was much more interested in the volume that we have seen the last week and decided to present to you volume from 1/20-1/27 and volume from 2/23-2/26.

This Does not mean that the upcoming price will skyrocket like it did in January. It is only a comparison of the volume with the open and closing prices. 

This is also not financial advice and I am not telling you to buy, sell or hold. 

To any journalists/reporters that reads these threads and wants to claim that this price movement is due to a bunch of retail investors I would like to respond with a healthy FUCK YOU and that you should know better that the amount of volume that is happening is not because of the retards here.

In less than 10 seconds from being transferred, got a broker who took 10 minutes of reviewing my account before telling me he could have it done by Monday.  ( I guess the 2 hour remark was to get me to pass on following through with my request tonight. ) He told me he would try to make it as painless as possible and I told him I wasn't aware that there should be any pain in this process. (Awkward silence from his side then he laughed and stated that it was a poor choice of words...I'm thinking maybe a projection on his part). When asked for confirmation that process was completed, he told me he would call me personally and let me know it was done.

* Wall street still view Gamestop as a brick and mortar company and bases their estimates on that. The neurodegenerative boomers are slowly waking up and this view is gradually changing. **When they finally understand that this is an e-commerce company the estimates and valuation *will* change.**

* Hedge funds and other **institutions *keeps* shorting**. Some are trapped and have no choice and others see it as a high risk high reward play. But we have hedge funds on our side as well. And they will help us reach escape velocity. The problem is not hedge funds, it's being able to short 140%.

**Last week‚Äôs 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA 
**Last week‚Äôs losers: BIDU XPEV**

**On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD

*I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I‚Äôm playing.* 

**UPDATE: DOCU CEO** speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM. [This 300c 3/5 came through last week](https://i.imgur.com/dD2cqVp.jpg). Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. 

****

When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.

**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can‚Äôt afford it, don‚Äôt play it.** There are opportunities every day. 

Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.

****

**1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**

On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an ‚Äúinvestor day‚Äù**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.

I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.

Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**

It was time to get to work.

****

**2.	The investigation**

I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.

1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.

2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.

*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. 

*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*

These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".

****

**3.	Defining RAMBO**

As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**

I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present üò¨ üòâ.

**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I‚Äôll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**

****

**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** 

**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**

**My theory is that the current ER environment‚Äîwhere your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. 

**5. So what am I saying?**

I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.

**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I‚Äôll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**

[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.

The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.

You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.

As always pick a good entry point.

[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn‚Äôt the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright 

Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:

&gt;BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.
A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.

Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.

[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) üöÄ üò¨ 

CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.

[ZNGA](https://i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) üöÄ üò¨ 

Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)

[NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.

**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I‚Äôm a bandwagon hopper ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble

****

**TLDR**:
Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.

I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.

As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important. 

So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.

The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.

Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.

Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!

This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.

Calls were cheap on Friday so I bought 170 BRK.B $242.50C 3/5/21. $50K YOLO on the Oracle of Omaha."

It was disclosed at that time that in terms of equity structure, Ant Group contributed 4 billion yuan to 50% of the shares, Nanshang Bank accounted for 15.01 percent of the shares, Cathay Pacific Shihua accounted for 10% of shares, Ningde Times accounted for 8% of shares, Qianfang Technology accounted for 7.01% of shares, and Hua Finance Industry and Yuyue Medical accounted for 4.99% of shares, respectively. Yuyue Medical, as a general funder, plans to contribute 399 million yuan with its own funds. The board of directors of Ants for the elimination of money is composed of seven directors, and the board of supervisors is composed of five supervisors, including representative supervisors of employees and shareholders' supervisors.

If the above information is true, it means that the seven major shareholders who spend money in Chongqing Ant will further increase the proportion of registered capital. Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance will carry out consumer finance-related business after its establishment. The business scope is: RMB business: (1) issuing personal consumption loans; (2) accepting deposits from domestic subsidiaries and domestic shareholders; (3) borrowing from domestic financial institutions; (4) issuing approved financial bonds; (5) domestic Interactual lending; (6) consulting and agency business related to consumer finance; (7) acting as an agent to sell insurance products related to consumer loans; (8) fixed-income securities investment business; and (9) other business approved by the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission.

It should be pointed out that the news that Ants were approved for fund-raising was coming out at a time when the Ant Group Sprint Science and Technology Innovation Board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange were on the market. With the suspension of the ant group's IPO last November, there has been no public progress in the news about ant's money-removing. In a report at the time last September, Financial Tiger pointed out that the approval of the establishment of Ant Fund-Ran will bring about great changes to its current consumer lending business of the group, and does not even rule out the possibility of future divestiture or business restructuring. There is also the possibility of dividing flowers and borrowing into Ant Consumer Gold in the future.

It is also analyzed that Ant Group's original consumption finance-related business is facing certain public opinion pressure. The contradiction mainly focuses on its leverage ratio and the risk of excessive concentration of business. The acquisition of money-free licenses has a significant benefit in mitigating such risks. In addition, with the implementation of the new regulations on the supervision of small lenders, Ant Group can gradually transfer some of its consumer financial business through small loan companies to consumer finance companies to enhance business compliance and sustainability.

On September 14 last year, industrial and commercial changes occurred in Chongqing Ant Shangcheng Small Loan Co., Ltd. and Hua, the main operating entities Chongqing Ant Xiaowei Micro Loan Co., Ltd. and Hangzhou Ant Future Technology Co., Ltd., and the holding parent companies of the three companies are all limited shares of Zhejiang Ant Micro Financial Services Group. The division was officially changed to Ant Group. At the same time, Yu Shengfa, the legal person and chairman of the two main operating companies, withdrew and changed to Huang Hao. Hu Xi, the former legal person, executive director and general manager of Hangzhou Ant, withdrew and changed to Ni Xingjun.

With the change of the regulatory environment of financial technology, after Ant Group's IPO was suspended, there was a lot of industry attention about how its business would be reorganized. According to the previous prospectus data of Ant Group, its lending business has developed into its largest source of income. In the first half of 2020, its loan revenue increased by 59% to Rmb29 billion, accounting for 40% of the group's total revenue. Ant Financial has more than 700 million Alipay users per month, and it puts cooperation with traditional banks at the core of its strategy. In the 12 months to June 2020, its loan platform has granted credit to about 500 million people, and the annualized interest rate charged for smaller loans is about 15%. Borrowing money similar to credit cards and unsecured consumer loan products was the basis of Ant Group's plan to seek a valuation of $225 billion in the upcoming IPO.

Ant Group has been interviewed twice by regulators before. According to the content of the second interview, one of them is to improve corporate governance and strictly rectify illegal credit, insurance, financial management and other financial activities in accordance with prudential supervision requirements. Since then, news about the business reorganization and rectification of Ant Group has been circulating in the market.

In late December last year, two people directly familiar with the matter said that Ant Group was considering integrating most of its online financial business into a holding company, including the consumer loan business.

In early January this year, it was reported that Ant Group was planning to restructure its consumer credit business in order to continue to lend nationwide under new regulations, otherwise it might severely restrict Ant Group's most profitable business. This is part of an ant group's comprehensive assessment of its corporate structure. Ants hope to gradually shift their main consumer credit business to a new consumer financial sector with the power to operate nationwide, according to people familiar with the matter. In theory, switching to the consumer financial sector will enable Ant Group to continue lending nationwide without waiting for a new license plate.

Alibaba revealed in the financial report on February 2 that there was a major uncertainty about Ant Group's IPO plan, and Ant Group contributed $735 million in profits in the third quarter. Also in early February, it was reported that Ant Group planned to divest its consumer credit data business, and Ant Group became a more tightly regulated financial holding company, which was a key part of Ant Group's business restructuring. Ant Group declined to comment.

Zhang Yong, chairman of Alibaba's board of directors and CEO, said in a financial teleconference on February 3 that once Ant Group has completed the relevant regulatory procedures for approving the plan, market information will be updated in time. Financial tiger also noted at that time that when talking about Ant Group's consumer credit business, Zhang Yong pointed out that in China's retail market, payments made with flowers account for only a small proportion of the total credit amount, and the vast majority of consumers associate their payment accounts with multiple sources of funding, including credit cards. It's just one of the financing channels. Although the changing regulatory environment applicable to financial technology and Internet platform companies poses recent challenges to Alibaba, it believes that it is an important opportunity to reassess and improve business practices.

I believe that there will be an answer soon as to what plan Ant Group will restructure and where the consumer credit business will eventually go."

605,I shopped at GameStop today and it blew my mind.,2021-02-27 03:01:51,"I went into a GameStop with my girlfriend so she could buy her normal little Pokemon Knick knacks and t-shirts.... BUT.... My visit made me rethink that GameStop really is doing better than I thought.

First of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.

But seriously, I'm here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven't paid attention to their membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use their membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.

When it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What's the membership do.

It's 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.

I felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.

But the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.

Granted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but their membership program change is working.

I commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.

TLDR: felt like the new membership program was üî•, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.

609,GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market. I did some research &amp; analysis.,2021-02-27 02:44:52,"Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!

**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.

New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings

Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&amp;P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)

**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn‚Äôt suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.

**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.

**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)

**START**

I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I‚Äôve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)

If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are ‚Äúcoincidences‚Äù as many have suggested.

**PROCESS**

I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Covariance &amp; Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)

[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)

The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on ‚Äúluck‚Äù or ‚Äúchance‚Äù. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to ‚Äúluck‚Äù. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.

**So, what does this mean?**

**My opinions.**

To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.

My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.

**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**

Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.

I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much

I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".

In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.

Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.

So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.

Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.

Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!

**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.

[u\/big\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)

For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.

**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!**"

The first and biggest development is they received fda approval for the first injectable cellulite treatment, and plan on launching in March. They have yet to announce pricing, and have completely left revenue out of the guidance put out last week.

The second development is they now have an fill-to-finish agreement with Novavax for their covid vaccine. As far as we know, this for US based distribution. However, we don‚Äôt know much about this agreement, as the details are not public knowledge. Endp also left this revenue out of their guidance.

The third development is that they may not be losing exclusivity for their biggest drug vasostrict.  Endo filed a patent for a labeling update, which if approved, makes their loss of exclusivity questionable. Judging by how Teva/gsk trails are going, endp might have a chance. We will know by July.

And last but not least, we have the opioid trail. This is what it‚Äôs all about ladies and retards. The trails should be picking back up as March rolls in and these guys have zero breathing room. With the way they have structured their debt covenants, they could easily go bankrupt if they get a nasty ruling. Because of this, and the weak-ass guidance put out last week, the stock crater Friday, and to be honest it will probably continue to crater as hedgies short it into the ground. Strangely though, their bonds have been trading close to par.

So there are two scenarios come summertime. Either the stock goes titts up, or these guys go to mars.

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)

There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.

The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.

**CAVEATS:**

* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t
* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.

**Assumptions used:**

GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)

GME Total Shares: 69,750,000

The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!

**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**

Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.

The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker‚Äôs FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).

Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.

Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.

\----------

**Part 3: ETFs**

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)

They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).

&gt;‚Äú‚Ä¶we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).‚Äù

If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).

NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF

\----------

**TLDR:**

THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **üíéüôå** üíé will prevail!!!

**Stake:** shares in GME **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ**

**PS:** you guys! I‚Äôm truly honored by how popular you‚Äôve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an ü¶ç could ever want! I‚Äôll continue to post updates on this data next week :)

For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""

621,I'm reposting this to hear a legit response as to why GME can squeeze when the short float is down by over 100% where it was.,2021-03-01 10:19:25,"I'm not shorting the fuckin stock. I've had shares since June at a 4.88 avg and am holding for a few years to see how they do unlike many paper handed pussies around town. 

Here's the data for GME on the short interest stats. https://imgur.com/gallery/emu2Mdp

I imagine when GME dipped to $38 shorts started unloading a decent amount. I also assume due to the ITM calls, we are still currently bullish due to the gamma squeeze that exposed market makers from being delta neutral. 

Here's my pride and joy of being one step ahead of the game: https://imgur.com/gallery/kMdnQZK

I am convinced no one can give a logic explaination as to how a short squeeze can be pulled off when we've learned how hedge funds can roll out time on their shares, deflate price, use swaps instead of shorts, etc.... And the float is 30% full. That would mean gme is still shortable by 60% of the float.  

I'm holding and hoping for a good gamma squeeze but until someone proves me wrong here, I'm convinced the short squeeze is over.

Edit: if you're down voting off of a confirmation bias, you're a shitty trader. A good trader considers all probabilities in an unbias manner. 

I'm holding longer than 90% of this sub so you can stfu and quit telling me I'm shorting. I'm not selling for years bc my avg price is 100 shares at 4.88. Simple as that."
