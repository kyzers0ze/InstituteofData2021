Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we. 

This is not financial advice. I’m just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.

85,I suspect the hedgies are illegally covering their short positions,2021-02-02 03:03:05,"TLDR; **Melvin and gang hasn't covered shit. They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close &gt;50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

&gt;A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

&gt;Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
&gt;Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
&gt;By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
&gt;To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities."

100,I feel like clarification is needed about Today,2021-02-02 00:17:47,"There’s a lot of new people on here that don’t really understand the play going on right now on both sides and I felt like we need to clear up some misconceptions so you can make your own decisions. 

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can’t know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON’T COVER. 
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can’t circumvent it.
They’re bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That’s why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it’s not.

We also know they’re down BAD. Why?
Because they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let’s see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell.

Just look at the volume. People are not selling:

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

**Manipulating the Media**: 

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)

Now let’s get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) 
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. 
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. 

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Silver squeeze not happening links:

Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: 

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.**

🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎

Last but not least I’m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I’m holding because I hope to see a better future and I’m holding for all you out there.

That was a calculated effort to bring down our position. FUCK OFF BILLIONAIRS, well still take you fucking money; who do you think will fund our food stamps?

We didn’t “lose” because we made a bad call, we “lost” because we made the RIGHT call and this disturbed  some folks at the top. 

I was reading 2 articles in Wall Street journal and it made my blood boil- first article was saying “random penny stock went up 30% with no news or announcement”- the people that are paid to predict and report and are the expert at stock market are saying this shit. The second article right after made me want to fuck the writers wife: “GME and AMC, Reddit favorite stocks, plunged after apparent loss in interest from retail investors” LOSS IN  INTEREST? MOTHERFUCKER WE CAN ONLY BUY 5 FUCKING SHARES EACH. 

WE LIKE THE STOCK. THOSE FUCKS JUST DON’T LET US BUY IT. How is GameStop and AMC and BB not already suing robinhood? Is any stock expert really gonna act like had they not restricted in Thursday, it would have went down that much? 

What the fuck is this gaslighting? That last week didn’t happen? Why are every news channel acting like they called GME or BB or AMC falling like it happened organically and not deliberately by everyone involved? 

Is GME worth 400$? FUCK NO. But since when was the stock market about actual worth? Stocks have become fiat currency in themself, doesn’t matter than company quarterly earnings, or its news, if people buy it, it goes up. When you restrict that- it goes down. 

We were up against billions of fund, trading platforms that we do not own or have a say in, our weapons, controlled by the enemy. Those fucks in TV acting like they actually called GME falling like this or acting like this is perfectly normal are trying to gaslight us about what happened in Thursday. 

FUCK THEM. We still got GME to go up and caused international fevor- we made the right call, we had the right stock, we had the right people, our enemies just had control of the only weapon we could use."

118,How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits,2021-01-29 20:17:25,"How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&amp;utm_medium=your_mom&amp;utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can’t afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There’s a catch. You need enough money (please don’t use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder."

121,"It’s time for a government bailout of GME shareholders at $10,000 per share. This would be roughly equivalent to the $700 billion bank bailout in 08 that was necessary to prevent ‘systemic risk’.",2021-01-29 13:47:56,"The short positions put on by the hedge funds are posing a systemic risk to the market.  Bail out both sides by liquidating the hedge funds, but not the brokers or clearinghouses, but also put a buy order in for $10k per share to allow GME shareholders to exit.  Isn’t $700 billion better than a financial meltdown?  Just like last time you can ‘put rules in place to make sure this won’t happen again’

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn’t bail them out, so the government did it.

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again. The hedge funds involved are deservedly bankrupt, and the retail traders get the reward they deserve by playing the free market game by the rules."

There are quite a few wsb-logo Twitter accounts pushing this. This is BS &amp; the straight up the ANTITHESIS of who we are. 

By buying silver/going long on silver, you would be directly putting money into the pockets of the EXACT HEDGE FUNDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF $GME 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎 🙌  The hedge funds are LONG silver NOT short silver.

The media, Wall Street, normies, and every other non-WSB autist are trying to push you to buy silver. This would be a tragic, irreversible decision that not only will most likely not make you any money because the squeeze is fake, it will put you on the sidelines from this righteous and glorious war we are in. 

If you are looking for alternative investments to GME, I’d recommend simply getting in on the $BANG GANG- Blackberry, AMC, Nokia, and GME. 

For the feds and the media and all the dumb people reading this, I am the last thing from a financial advisor and am a complete, 100%, full retard autist. 

BANG GANG CHEEEEEEEHOOOOOOOOO

Edit: I am not talking down on silver as an investment, I am not saying it's not a good hedge, I'm not saying anything bad about silver in any form. I'm simply pointing out that right now, this ""squeeze"" that all these people are referring to is definitely not a ""squeeze"" at all and is an artificial hedge-fund driven attempt to reduce the GME momentum and we should all be cognizant of the media manipulation and happening everywhere including right here. For all you that want to buy silver, great, buying the bullion directly in my humble autistic opinion is better than shares in a fund that supposedly buys it but don't trust some autist on the internet. BANG GANG

Edit #2: Fellow autists, we have ascended to the #2 post on all of reddit. Our $GME gains this week and beyond will carry us to the gates of Valhalla.

This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. 
For people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don't go bankrupt.

I know this sub is now filled with a lot of new people telling you to buy the dip. Don't get emotional with money. This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.

I know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with ""to the moon 🚀""
But please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.

This isn't the last thing I'll do, but it's a start.  Once we've landed on Mars, more will be coming.  Tomorrow I'm dropping off $1K at my local hospital to buy coffee and donuts for our front lines.  These guys are heroes.  They're struggling.  Overworked, going through emotions, getting sick, some losing lives to a senseless disease.  Its the least I can do.  Find something you care about and give back.  It'll make this all seem so much more rewarding.

Sorry not sorry you worked all weekend scouring memes and getting the tendieman song stuck in your head.

False media reports about “Reddit traders” moving en-mass into silver, SPACs, or whatever is benefiting hedge funds at the moment is getting out of control.

It doesn’t take more than 2 seconds and a smooth brain to pull up front page of WSB to see that nobody is talking about that shit (except for the bots).

This is a clear case of market manipulation to lure outside investors into a “momentum opportunity” by fraudulently invoking the “reddit army” for whatever is convenient. This shit is getting out of control.

175,Message from a TSLA veteran: Shut the fuck up and hold,2021-02-03 02:38:54,"Every other comment right now is a shill lamenting the stupidity of everyone who’s still holding or how sad it is the big guy won again or some other gloomy horseshit. 

To all of you who are out there who’ve ever thought “oh man, if I’d only bought X stock X years ago I’d be rich!” - if you aren’t holding right now, you’re wrong. 

I’m an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn’t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I’m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it’s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin’s mistake? No actual hedging. Don’t be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won’t help if you’re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I’ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don’t give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren’t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It’s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we’re in dire straits probably didn’t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold. Do you want to be the “Golly I could’ve had Apple 20 years ago!” guy for the rest of your life, or do you wanna be the strong motherfucker who actually took the leap?"

Just look at the AMC thread up on the frontpage at the moment. Half the comments are from new accounts with just a handful of karma. AMC is not the next GME. The 'days to cover' on AMC is less than a day. After an initial uptick it will just fizzle out and you'll be left bagholding.

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way. 
Hope you have nice day, all the best.

Let's send journalists some love and welcome them because we need all the help we can get against MSM

Edit - I've had quite a lot of messages concerning WSB's interest in silver dating back from long ago, long before I was a member so I just wanted to clarify something. 
Here is a clarification : 
I wanted to reflect the disparity between how few silver posts I was seeing on wsb in and around the time of the media hype and how so many media outlets were pushing the "" WSB's next target is silver!"" agenda. Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver. The important point in my mind was that MSM as I saw it had blanket reported something about the subreddit I believed was an inaccurate representation of the real sentiment."

182,The real reason Wall Street is terrified of the GME situation,2021-01-31 08:10:30,"I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails–to–deliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.
3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to ""take down the shorts"" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell. I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place."
183,GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze,2021-02-06 17:22:22,"DISCLAIMER: This post is NOT Financial Advice!  
   
  
This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

185,15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight),2021-02-01 21:58:21,"Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

So make your own due dilligence and don’t trust financial advice of others (the argument for that you can read to a certain extent below).

**Autists, Degenerates, Idiocracy of the World – let me get this straight!**

In the coming days I don’t wanna see all this whining and bitching on this sub and espescially in the daily GME threads anymore. On every fucking corner of this sub I smell doubt, you read messages the likes of „this is over“, „we missed the squeeze“, „I am going to loose it all“, „entered at 320$ - I am doomed“. What the fuck is wrong with you retards, did you fucking wanker your wifes boyfriend dick all night and lost your mind over the effort to do so? I think I got to get this accross the Buddy Stephens way to get you down to fucking earth and get your attitude right.

**1) You come to a sub called** r/wallstreetbets **and yolo your hard earned money in $GME**

You realize what you are doing here - you true fuck - dont you? This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET – yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! – and follow DD posted by people with names like „SHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS“? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry „One-Wish-comes-true“ show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn’t exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don’t trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments – this is about „get rich or die trying!“. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this „Saudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts – but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don’t know what’s the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now – could be though the next big thing – got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET – the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize – you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn’t do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? 😓**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It’s a fucking global movement now (or not – could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have 🙌💎and the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy – we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven’t understand the concept or how this works – speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up – desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors – shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious – you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let’s be fucking honest – most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody – I even don’t remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it – we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That’s it. If we are right – this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock – do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought – hmmmm makes sense – I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don’t want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) – no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the 🚀 is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please – no post without 🙌💎🙌💎🙌💎🚀🚀🚀 and if you want to fukn leave the party – leave – but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I’d rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  – I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have 🙌💎

211,"If your friends and family are wondering why you're buying $GME @ $300, maybe you can explain it to them like this:",2021-01-30 13:42:15,"There's a rich kid in town. Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000. So while it's possible that Melvin could buy his way out of it, it's very difficult.\]"

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

&gt;""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

&amp;#x200B;

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ✅

&gt;In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ✅

&gt;As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

Just remember that when DFV was buying $GME at prices as low as $4 per share he wasn't signing up for the 'diamond hands never sell' club and he never got into the play for reasons like smashing hedge funds, curing cancer etc. That stuff has all come about from us and people jumping on the bandwagon.

WSB before this crazy week that has changed the sub forever was all about taking on risk to try and make money fast. DFV has achieved that on a scale we haven't seen before and if he decides to take profits we should support him doing so and not get upset that it may affect the price etc or say he betrayed a cause he never signed up for.

If you've watched the guys youtube you will know he's an extremely nice and likeable guy, would hate to see people calling him judas or whatever if he decides to sell."

239,"If GameStop hits 800 before 2/26 we will trigger the Mother of All Short Squeezes, read up.",2021-02-25 07:25:32,"Alright, ya fucks, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

*If GameStop hits 800 before 2/26 we will trigger the Mother of All Short Squeezes*

As we learned from the last spike to 483, it was **not** the shorts squeezing. *As Melvin* ***admitted*** *in the Congressional Hearing that they did* ***not*** *cover and the spike was from* ***gamma****.*

If you do not know, this ""gamma squeeze"" occurs because of call options. As the prices surges, Market Makers are forced to write more calls and buy shares before they even become available, surging the price higher. 

So, now because we have fallen all the way back down to $40, we have a catapult cocked down as far as it can go, ready to be launched.

There are *millions, and millions, and* ***millions*** of shares written in those call options all the fucking way up to 800. These shares are not only buried in the 2/26 calls, but also every single date after this as well. ***So many fucking shares.***

If we can get to 800 and *all these calls become* ***in the money*** the Market Makers will have to scramble to buy millions and millions of shares that will surge the price up.

The craziest part is that this does not even take into account the shorts covering. So, as the Mother of All Gamma Squeezes squozes, sending the price into the thousands, the shorts will then also be skyrocketing the price at infinitely higher prices.

If you did not read my last dd [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/) about GME short interest being 400%, we learned that u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME’s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.*** 

Now, while I then believed this to be a completely outlandish number, I now believe to have realized that this gamma squeeze that will occur if we hit 800, ***is what it predicted.*** 

*To reiterate:*

*I believe that the AI-Model of GameStop's share price, which predicts $130k a share, is predicting this because it believes that we will hit 800 before 2/26, therefore causing the* ***M****other* ***o****f* ***A****ll* ***G****amma* ***S****queezes. Which will* ***then*** *trigger the infinity short squeeze which sends us to $100k+.* 

Many others are also starting to realize this as well, check out this post on r/stocks 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme\_gamma\_squeeze\_part\_two/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrrcdk/gme_gamma_squeeze_part_two/)

While this is not financial advice, it is in my opinion that we need to do our best in holding and buying in order to get the stock price above $800 before Friday. This AI believes we fucking did it, lets prove the future right.

Right now WSB is like Rocky and every politician out there wants to line up to be in a selfie with Rocky. They're just using us for exposure especially to a crowd that they see as untapped.

Please dont let this place turn into a constant circle jerk of politics. Basically all of reddit is just political propaganda 24/7. This was the last good place on the internet. The LAST. It was the last actually funny place too. Once in awhile it even had incredible ideas.

 It's about to be co-opted by politics activists online claiming they care about ""this issue"". Then they're going to stick around and sometimes subtly and most of the time forcefully turn it into another propaganda machine.
It just makes me sick because I already know its over. I dont want it to be but this place is going to be filled with propaganda and nothing else almost 100% after GME is over. I'll miss you guys and all the great times and sarcasm. This place was the funniest place on the internet.

Belfort is the epitome of what we’re up against as retail. He’s a convicted con artist who actually did so much fucked up shit he didn’t just get a slap on wrist from the SEC, he actually went to prison. 

He was just anti-GME a few days ago, and now he’s meme-ing in its favor? A meme repeating the sentiments being echoed in this sub? 

It’s pretty clear to me. Belfort came to the realization that this is the next generation of decentralized hedge fund. There’s power when a bunch of apes all like the same stonk. He sees the popularity and realizes the potential and impact that crowd sourced DD will do. He knows communities like this will grow. And he wants to use you. 

this is nothing more than seedy opportunist bullshit because Belfort realizes you’re the exact type of person who makes him rich- a retard who yolos into risky investments at the idea of massive % gains. he wants to capitalize on the popularity of GME and this sub. He wants to sell you his shitty motivational book and the idea that he can teach you how you can be rich and famous with his “miNdSeT” when really he got rich by scamming people, and famous for being caught. 

Please. Stop. He is not your friend. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him try to leverage popularity gained here to a “trading community” of his own:

# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.

Hedge funds get paid more by fraudulently creating more shares when the stock goes under. They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist. Manipulating the number of shares also dilutes the reported short float. Retail is holding on to shares they need and just not letting go, as some of those shares retail has are fraudulent.

:edit 2: Please note one reason prices are still high is to encourage retail go to other stocks (looking at you AMC, BB, NOK), or get more easily duped by some scam like silver. It's always been about GME.

When it comes time for them to pay up, expect the price to drop first.

I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too. My father would've loved this cause and would've rallied with us till the end.

I had a cool ass dad and you guys all deserve to have a cool ass dad too. He believed in me, and he believed in you too. Whether you're winners, or losers, or damn dirty apes. 

We love you dad. Thank you for believing in us."
277,"Analysis on Why Hedge Funds Didn't Reposition Last Thursday, Why They Didn't Cover on Friday, and Why They Want You to Think They Did. (GME)",2021-02-05 22:39:28,"Fellow Apes, I have seen a lot of discussion on the possibility of hedge funds covering and whether or not they could have covered during the RH shutdown. I have done some analysis and would like to shares my results. This is not investment advice and should not be construed as such.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.🚀🚀🚀

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a chart of the 29th with my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/nU0JOXs)

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &amp;gt;100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &amp;gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

Edit 1: 
For those of you that are in doubt.  
First of all, even if they would’ve bought every possible share in the last couple days, they wouldn’t be able to close all of their short positions (volume was way to low!). Secondly if they would‘ve closed and therefore bought shares, the price wouldn’t be where it is atm. It would be way higher. Third, why would they invest so much effort (market and media manipulation) if they already exited?

Edit 2: Last attempt as in „I believe that this ladder attacking tactic will be the last thing that they can try on us“. But maybe it’ll take us some time of holding the line to break this.

291,I am going to short the whole country of South Africa.,2021-02-16 08:54:09,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&amp;cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&amp;FORM=ANAB01&amp;PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode."

I've been neglecting sleep and insufflating copious amounts of Colombian blow just so I can remain symbiotically attached to every shred of current market data I could find about GME and its current trajectory. 

So, I'm basically an expert at this point (and so is my cousin who used to work for a NASA contractor in Cocoa Beach, Florida). 

This basically puts me on par with that Cramer guy or whatever. 

Anyway, here's a snapshot of where we stand today: 

&amp;#x200B;

[A concerning uppy\/downy thing for some, but a harbinger of extreme, stratospheric ascension for the better-informed among us](https://preview.redd.it/vhlskfppfif61.jpg?width=966&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7426badc70e80e2ef9e342b4a2bcd622b40b704)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I want to draw your attention to to the dimensions of a three-sided polygon (aka triangle) that I created by referencing a few points that seemed highly sus and therefore worth referencing.   


The result of my wizardry is thus:

Now, this is where shit gets interesting. 

I knew there was something uncanny about the shape of this triangle. I fucking knew that I'd seen this EXACT same triangle before in relation to advanced rocketry, but I wasn't sure where. 

So, I contacted my dealer, boofed another eight ball of the Devil's dandruff, and got to work meticulously pouring through all the available data until BAM. I found it. 

Feast your eyes on this:

These three-sided polygons are the SAME. I mean, not ^(exactly) but fuck, it's goddamned close enough to call it. And I'm calling it. 

Motherfucker, if you're not 100% convinced that GME is LITERALLY about to go fucking vertical, then you simply aren't paying attention. It's not my fault if you can't understand basic math, geometry, and astrophysics. 

Ok. My work is done here. After we've all made our millions, I wouldn't mind being handsomely compensated for the selfless efforts I've expended just so you mouthbreathers can have some fun money to throw around at your retirement parties.

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use &gt;4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

EDIT: I believe Robinhood does not even report volume properly on their charts. Anyone who was saying the volume on the day is 15 million or whatever is correct and I should have thought to check a better platform before making this post.

Notice the huge red dildo staring at your face. Now look at the bar under that dildo, that is the volume. Is that move remotely justified by that little volume? Look at the previous days where there was massive amount of buying going on, volume was 4x on those days compared to Thursday and yet those candle sizes do not even compare.

To make this more understandable look at the retard on your left and then look at the retard on your right. FYI THEY'RE NOT FUCKING SELLING.

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They’re running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They’re just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there’s a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that’s why they’re playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That’s why there are lawsuits. 

1) HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

4)HOLD AND BUY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

5)REMOVE YOUR STOP LOSSES❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️

6) SET LIMIT AS HIGH AS YIU CAN

7) DO NOT LOCK IN GAINS because you want to BUY DIPS. With the restriction, this strategy is not plausible

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won’t be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

10) think positive of the BIG REWARD. You CANT lose more than your total investment but  GAINS ARE LIMITLESS and this is what’s SCARING wallstreet. (Example if you invested 10k, all you would lose would be 10k but could be walking away with 100k, 1 million , 10 million depending on the resilience of all of us to BUY AND HOLD🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕)

Since the most recent mod shakeup, the entire team has been petitioning to bring zjz back. We wanted to keep you in the loop, but couldn't, because it might have hurt our chances of getting zjz back. We understand why this might have made you suspicious, but we're excited to put those suspicions to rest today.

Reddit Admins care deeply about the stability and continuity of the community, and so do we. At the end of the day, WSB is not defined by who is at the top of the mod list, it's defined by the conversations we create.

Even in the absence of zjz, we saw awesome discussions happening. Tons of great DDs, insane YOLOs, and beautiful, beautiful, gain and loss porn.

Now, with zjz back, we can take things even further. We can relax posting restrictions on account age and karma, which we use as proxies for post quality, and instead focus on the content of what's being said.

The truth is, I am very, very, optimistic about the future of WSB over the next 3-5 years. We have the absolute best mod team the subreddit has had since inception. Everyone who is part of a team now is someone that has played a big role of either the subreddit, or discord, community for years.

We appreciate your patience with us and the admins. We were all blindsided as we were thrown into this shakeup. No doubt mistakes were made at the beginning, but we're getting better every day to bring you the WSB you probably don't deserve.

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

You got some gambling issues Stan, I think you need some counseling

To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when your stocks get down some

And what's this shit about us being ""in this together""?

Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do have diamond hands

I just don't want you to do some crazy shit

I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago so I bought GME in the dips

Some dude was high on PCP and drove his car to a Gamestop

And ""STONKS"" he screamed, for 24 hours outside the closed shop non-stop

And in the car they found a phone with 0 GME left, but I forgot who it belonged to

346,A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved,2021-01-29 16:54:21,"There is a prevailing mis-understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the ""market price."" This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors &amp; new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire &amp; pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially &amp; emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions."
347,SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?,2021-02-03 00:07:53,"*Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!*  


  
First off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.

https://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b

*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*

\*\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\*\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.

Here's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**

There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.

How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.

**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**

1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.
2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.
3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&amp;#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&amp;#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\_representation\_of\_a\_short\_ladder\_attack\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)
   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

https://preview.redd.it/77a0euotp5f61.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62b0af04608cb5fb235895d8bbd03b9e19a00588

&amp;#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

DFV is simply an eagle-eyed investor who bought into his GME positions quite a while ago, even before anyone here cared about GameStop's fundamentals or the remote possibility of a squeeze. He isn't some mischievous troll who decided sometime in early January to rally all of us into a stock-buying frenzy in order to stick it to some villainous wall street firm, nor did he ever make any special effort to promote GME in order to incite a squeeze. A large number of users here had known of the outsized short interest for a while so this entire thing was the organic result of increasing GME discussion.

355,We should be compiling links of sources claiming WSB is for silver,2021-02-01 13:45:36,"We’re not. Plain and simple. Anyone who frequents WSB knows this. 

This means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don’t do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.

If there was any doubt of these hedge fund’s influence and manipulate, this whole “WSB going silver” just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.



**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **""There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members""**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.

This goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now. Money comes and goes, but getting to witness firsthand just how rigged the system is and knowing **who's** involved in keeping people in line is just something you can't put a price tag on."

Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?

We don’t fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don’t give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don’t fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children’s college funds away just to post memes about it.

Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven’t owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.

Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face. 

Take all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250. Go fuck yourself."
365,Robinhood Is Lying - You Are Blocked Acquiring More Than 5 Total Shares,2021-01-29 11:11:53,"Vlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. 

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say “We reopened stock purchase of GME” and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here’s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I’m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas “The Shit Engine” Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it’s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what’s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here’s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

I know this post is going to get downvoted, but I've got to make it because I am very concerned that we could have a wave of self harm urges depending on the way GME moves.

Please. For the love of everything... be careful. Control your risk. Control the size of your positions and what you're willing to lose. I am seeing posts about people throwing in a million at levels above 200 or 250. Saying that it's everything they've made in the past few years, or maybe it's margin, or maybe it's their ira or savings.

Eventually this has to come down. Every single spike like this has. Nothing moves from 20 to 470 in a few days and stays there. Going to 1000? Because Volkswagen did? There's no reason to believe that it will and if it does, that candle wick top could be a small amount of shares. Please, PLEASE... just don't trade more than you can lose. I really am hoping with every fiber of my being that this thing shatters the moon and goes to mars for all of you. 

Once the collapse starts the order book could quickly evaporate. You could become trapped very easily and if you're anywhere above 100$ a share the odds of it coming back are extremely slim should this follow Volkswagen. They stayed under 30 for a decade once it was over. And it did end, and fast.

When things are extremely euphoric it's incredibly difficult to tell where you are at in the process. I don't know what's going to happen. What I do know, is that there's going to be some of us in bad shape, for one reason or the other.

I've been a trader for years. I've been a member here for quite a long time. I am making this post not to tell you what to do, but to recommend you manage what you do right now.

Some people are betting such large amounts so high up that they could find themselves in a mental break if they have bad luck. These kinds of movements are super exciting, but getting trapped with a large amount or margin amount high up on a flimsy spike can lead to self harm.

Which is why I want to urge you to use the hotline. If you're in a very bad place right now, please, use the hotline. Please don't use a permanent solution.

I love all of you guys. I love the memes you make. This part of the internet has been my favorite place for a long time. And I want all of us to keep making memes and having fun. Please be safe."

391,Daily reminder that buying GME at 300 before 28/1 was a great play at the time.,2021-02-12 15:21:46,"Yeah that’s right, I fucking said it. 

I’ve noticed the FUD campaign has been shifting lately, It’s shifted towards calling al you retards actually retarded for buying GME at it’s height. While yeah, buying high and selling low is actually retarded, I am not disputing that. 

But what I’ve noticed is that no one seems to be mentioning the fact that Robinhood (and by extension the DTC)  LITERALLY HIT THE ‘OFF’ SWITCH ON BUYS. That’s fucking right it was a great play before 28/1 even at 300 or 400. (If you bought at 300 after 28/1 you may actually be retarded)

The FUD campaign (or general memory loss from all the weed stonks) has made most of you forget that WE WERE FUCKING ROBBED.

Never forget that GME is not over.

Never forget that we were ROBBED of millions of dollars, not only in evaporated gains, but in actual investments with hard earned cash.

20@226$GME 26/1

Edit: DTC

Lots of people seem to be understanding this post as saying GME will go up diamond hands etc. This is not what the purpose of this post is. 

The purpose of this post is to make people remember that this was not fair play. 

If all you retards calling me retarded and delusional could learn to fucking read, that be great.

Edit 2:

As a response to all the arguments that it wasn’t a great play purely based on the fundamentals.

It was never about the fundamentals in the first place, it was a risky bet based on the incoming short squeeze that was purely stopped dead in it’s tracks because of the RH/DTC restrictions."

Original post: 

For those who see my ""Top Detective"" flair, but don't know [me](https://markets.businessinsider.com/commodities/news/robinhood-trader-made-2400-percent-return-coronavirus-oil-markets-2020-3-1028989430), I'm [the asshole who made videos this post is talking about.](http://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7b1b7/a_dark_part_wallstreetbets_history_and_why_its/) 

If you subscribe to r/videos, no doubt you have seen my video, [WallStreetBets and the Art of Sellout Out: An Illustrated Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lcperh/wallstreetbets_and_the_art_of_selling_out_an/), is climbing slowly to the top. If you haven't watched it, you should. 

While you were sleeping last night (night of 2/3), moderators who wanted to profit from THIS community, removed the moderators you know and love. They were replaced with brand new accounts. Literally minutes old. It was a coup. 

The long and short of it is, there was a movie deal. In fact, there was more than one. There were dollar signs in their eyes. The Gamestop catalyst that propelled our community to over 8 million members attracted media attention, naturally. It's no secret [he who must not be named sold out](https://www.wsj.com/articles/reddits-wallstreetbets-founder-sells-life-story-to-movie-producer-ratpac-entertainment-11612440001), as he has [in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caoF3jH7yG4), and some of the bad moderators were just a little behind him. 

For this reason, some moderators are no longer with us. They tried to go behind other moderator's backs to secure money for themselves, and monetize this subreddit. They even went as far to establish a website (blomberg.com) to intercept all media traffic so they themselves could profit. 

So the Reddit Admins intervened. 

Some of the moderators who grew this community, like u/zjz still have not been added back. Perhaps they will be back in the future. The good news is, the right moderators, the mods you all know and love, are coming back, and some already are here. People I know wouldn't take a dime, are taking back control, one meme filled shitpost at a time. 

He who must not be named still has a movie deal, so I leave you with this question: 

**How do you feel about a guy who has been scamming people for most of his adult life, getting paid six figures for a movie deal partially about scamming members of WallStreetBets?**

TLDR: We are this way, because it's the only way we are allowed to be, as retail traders.

Now that that's out of the way, lets look at it from a normie traders point of view.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Pattern Day Trading:** Why does it exist? To protect us? From what? Do you ask for a W2 for everyone literally walking into a casino to see if they are capable of losing what they are risking? No, they are free to spend as they please. Funny, I thought that's what a free market was for too?
2. **Market Makers:** You want us to literally just stop, leave, and use a casino? Use DraftKings and that sort of platform, ok. Now what, how do you make your money off of ""dumb money"" when it's gone? You need us, we need you.
3. **\*WHY\* is a collective of people on Reddit such a danger?:** For the sake of arguing, before this happened, there were 800,000 of us just being collectively dumb together. LETS JUST SAY, combined, we had 1 billion dollars between 800,000 people. That's scary? You lost 2.7b in the first wave of short losses, then asked for help for another 3b. Do you know what that means? THAT MEANS, that hedge funds, as a collective, is the problem, NOT REDDIT.
4. **When we got together, it was a crime, when you got together, it was not a problem?** How can we be ""investors"" in a rigged game, literally, please explain it. We HAVE TO GAMBLE to make money, because those are YOUR RULES.
5. **Trading is passive income, not a job:** Yeah, it's a passive way to kill time for 95% of us, make a little side money, couple grand here or there, sometimes get lucky and make 10k. This is a lot for regular people, it's literally NOTHING to you, but debt payment and vacation funds for us.
6. **We are Degenerates and Dumb Money:** If a large group of dumb people cost you money is a problem...then why is a large group of smart people (you market makers and hedge funds) that manipulate costs to take dumb moneys money away, allowed?

Anyways, there is a list 3 miles long.

GameStop isn't about GameStop, it's a beacon of reason, it could have been any stock, Citron just picked the target and we used it.

Good Luck Diamond Handing gents. Think about it this way. No matter what happens, **THEY HAVE LOST MORE MONEY THIS MONTH**, than what average day traders have collectively made in 5 years. Let that sink in.

Edit: This blew up, appreciate all the support!

I recently saw this video, it's 10 minutes long, but the ***first 3 are incredibly important!***  
***Jim Cramer*** exposes what illegal activities hedge funds and short sellers do to manipulate the market. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4&amp;t=2s) . They literally take advantage of the SEC not knowing what they do.

Eventually they, like blessed light, will be absorbed entirely by the One True Lender Bank, and they will come out the other side clean and pure. They must not hasten the process, though, just as light cannot hasten its black hole rebirth. It was born with a direction and held it firmly, for eons.

GME shareholders now live in a caste system. Citizens wear physical symbols of their number of shares, like pieces of flair.

&gt;Oh my god! GME is down to $150! It's down to $100! It's down to 30 cents! The hedgies are going to cover all their shorts at that 30cent price point! It's over!

Wrong.

No one is selling at these prices. Sure, maybe a few scared folk who don't know any better. Maybe they trigger a few stop losses. Maybe some margins get called. But it's not enough. Say it with me:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

&gt;WHAT?!

You heard me. 30cent GME? No problem.

They don't need a low price, they need your shares. If 10 people sell at 30c cents, and that's the only market activity, it's a ""30 cent stock"" but Melvin only netted ten shares. They are still fucked. *They aren't buying 50 million shares at 30c, nor $100, nor $300, and that's their problem.* It's an availability issue. Sometimes it's ALSO a price issue (too high for them) but primarily it's the availability.

All the activity driving down the listed share price are *illegal ladder attacks* (not that legality should be expected at this point, these folk are crooks). Those aren't actual sales though, it's just shares trading hands from hedgie to hedgie. They aren't gobbling up value. These people don't admit defeat, they are neither smart nor humble, they are crooks. They need 50 million+ shares. They need over 100% of the float to sell to them (that 50% float you hear about is accounting shennaigans, ignore it, they are still exposed). *You can NOT close that many positions sniping a few shaky handed noobs.* We aren't talking about a few shares they need to buy, we're talking about fucking ALL OF THEM.

I'll explain that in a second, but first let me repeat:

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

So let's say you want to buy 50 million shares, let's look at what shares are being asked for in my hypothetical example market:

**# of Shares - Price**

x 20 - $0.30c

x 80 - $5

x 400 - $20

x 600 - $40

x 900 - $60

x 2,000 - $100

x 5,000 - $150

x 10,000 - $200

x 30,000 - $300

x 50,000 - $400

x 150,000 - $500

x 1 mil - $1,000

x 15 mil - $5,000

x 30 mil - $69,420

Get it? There are only a few people willing to sell at those low prices. By the time you've bought a quarter million shares (0.5% of what you need to buy) you're back up to the sustained highs. And these are just exaggerations to make a point. *A stock price only reflects current trade values, not availability at those prices*. If the hedgies are trading their shares back and forth to each other to drive down the price and they have ladder attacked down to a Nickel, that doesn't mean anyone's shares are only worth pocket change, that just means that that is what things are trading at in the moment. There's no volume to buy up at those costs. No one can force you to sell at a Nickel.

Get it?

*PRICE DOESN'T MATTER*

They need our shares, not a low price. The price does not reflect whether we are 'winning' or not. Their financial reserves indicate that, but there isn't a ticker for that. But be sure, every day the inevitable closes in. Sell out of fear if you like, but you'll just miss out in the end. People like me, as we shore up more funds, snipe these low prices, stealing away shares the hedgies use to ladder and taking shares away from shaky hands and putting them into steady ones.

This isn't financial advice, I just want to make sure people on this sub have the knowledge to not make fools of themselves in casual conversation."

This stock is holding up against Wall Street trying to make this thing crash. And guess what? All their tricks AREN’T working!

They know they are fucked. These are desperate moves done by people who know they are backed into a corner.

453,DO NOT BUY SILVER!,2021-01-31 20:11:20,"Do not try to buy precious metals in the next week while China is celebrating the beginning of their Year of the Metal Ox. Wait until after you are done holding GME, even though you are planning to hold GME forever.

Anything other than GME is a distraction. Since you are holding GME forever, you are never allowed to invest in anything else ever again. Holding GME is your life's work and requires your undivided attention. There is no possible way anyone would ever talk about anything other than GME unless they wanted you to sell GME. Even when it's a weekend and you can't sell GME anyway.

All of your money should be in your brokerage so you shouldn't even have any money available to buy bullion with. Your brokerage would never betray you. 

Don't think anything of the fact that online bullion dealers have frozen your ability to buy silver. The statements on their front pages saying they have to restrict your purchase ability due to unprecedented market conditions are nothing like any other statements you've seen from anyone recently. Don't think about it. 

The US dollar will never lose value again. Biden is going to make an announcement tomorrow that the federal reserve will burn a pile of money to reverse inflation, I can feel it. Hedging against this is something you would only do if you're shilling for a hedge fund. That's why they're called hedgies. 

Pay no attention to the mass downvotes and accusations of shilling to everyone suggesting silver. The ruling class would never seed a meme about silver being a distraction to divide the community from adding another major step to their plan.

Pay no attention to how major banks have sold 200x more silver than they actually have and if they're called to deliver on all those receipts instead of people continuing to be happy to just hold paper receipts they could *hypothetically* exchange, then... well, like I said, no matter.

The important thing is to spend your weekend wondering what will happen to GME while there is no action you can take on it. Don't focus on anything you could take action right now.

Don't sort comments by new. You don't want to see the unfiltered stream of consciousness of the subreddit, just stick to the carefully curated, vote-and-award-manipulated ranking of what everyone can agree on. We don't have any stickied threads sorted by new today because the people in charge here have your best interests at heart and they don't want you to get into trouble buying any silver. They're not like that other guy who tried to sell out the community, shame on him. Since they're not sellouts, there's no way they could ever make a mistake or allow the community to be misguided. Trust in them and blindly follow the subreddit's general direction at all times.

And most importantly, don't forget, you're very small. Silver has a market cap of $1.4 trillion. Big banks and governments have a vested interest in it. Don't you dare think your little wallets could possibly tip the scales of something this big going on right in front of you. Just take your tendies and quit while you're ahead, and don't think too much about where this is all leading next.

EDIT - We've got a usual stickied thread sorted by new, thanks mods! Good to see my satirical post rapidly becoming outdated. 🚀🚀🚀"

This is a long read but bare with me, this is some important shit and it will make your diamond hands even diamondier.

&gt; Short selling involves a sale of a security that the seller does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a security borrowed by, or for the account of, the seller. Short sales normally are settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the seller.

&gt; In a ‘‘naked’’ short sale, however, the short seller does not borrow securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due.

&gt; **Sellers sometimes intentionally fail to deliver securities as part of a scheme to manipulate the price of a security, or possibly to avoid borrowing costs associated with short sales, especially when the costs of borrowing stock are high.**

**This is what happened today with the price decrease**

To nobody's surprise, Gamestop short sellers Fail-To-Deliver a whopping... 

~~5 MILLION~~

*edit: Apparently the Fail-To-Deliver is not cumulative, but as of 1-14 it's 621,483 and that number can only be higher now. Regardless, the sentiment stands.*

shares of the stock meaning these short sellers are using Naked Short Selling and intentionally failing to deliver securities in order to avoid borrowing costs and manipulate the price of the stock downward.

# What's to be done?

Rule 204.

&gt; Rule 204 — Close-out Requirements. Under Rule 204, participants of a registered clearing agency (as defined in section 3(a)(24) of the Exchange Act) must deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale transaction in any equity security by settlement date, or must close out a fail to deliver in any equity security for a long or short sale transaction in that equity security generally by the times described as follows: the participant must close out a fail to deliver for a short sale transaction by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+4; if a participant has a fail to deliver that the participant can demonstrate on its books and records resulted from a long sale, or that is attributable to bona-fide market making activities, the participant must close out the fail to deliver by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the third consecutive settlement day following the settlement date, referred to as T+6. In addition, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO requires that participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in “threshold securities” if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days. Threshold securities, as defined by Rule 203(c)(6), are generally equity securities with large and persistent fails to deliver.

You can read more about this here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.204 lots of information that I haven't covered.

Gamestop *is* or will be classified as a threshold security due to the massive amounts of Fail-To-Deliver's they've accumulated this month, this means short sellers are legally forced to close their short positions and clearing houses will be be required to immediately purchase shares within the time-frame stated above. AKA SQUEEZE WILL BE SQUOZEN.

Edit: According to [this](https://www.theocc.com/Market-Data/Market-Data-Reports/Series-and-Trading-Data/Threshold-Securities-List) website, Gamestop IS listed as a threshold security.

#SHORT SELLERS ARE UNDER THE THUMB, AND ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY'RE SQUEEZED.

Their last hail mary is to manipulate the price downward as much as possible to lessen the blow of the inevitable squeeze. We literally have them by the balls and all we have to do is HOLD.

#TL:DR

The short squeeze is a ticking time bomb right now and all we have to do is hold to win. In a matter of days, short sellers will be FORCED to close their positions and clearing houses will be forced to purchase shares for all Fail-to-Delivers forcing the price to skyrocket and the squeeze to be squozen.

HOLD TIGHT YOU RETARDS, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

* Encourage newbies to periodically profit take. Also take profit yourself.

* Don’t blame the system if you buy the ATH and other people take profit.  

* You won’t time the top perfectly, try to aim within 10-20% of the top. 

* **Don’t get emotionally attached to the stock**. The stock doesn’t even know who you are. 

* If you buy in because a stock did the same thing 3 days in a row, don’t get mad if it doesn’t do the thing a 4th time.

* If you don’t have an exit strategy for your FOMO position, you are **guaranteed** to lose money. If you did not get in on the ground floor, your profitability window at the top is much tighter. 

* If you wouldn’t enter a stock/option at the current price, you shouldn’t be holding at the current price.

536,"For those of you missing the ""good 'ol days"" on WSB...",2021-01-30 13:14:59,"I've been around WSB now for about 5 years, mostly as a lurker.  I eventually created a reddit account but even then took a while to actually join the sub rather than just lurk.  So I was here for a good number of the ""fun"" moments of the last few years.  The box spreads that ""literally can't go tits up"".  Everyone piling on puts on snapchat.  Good 'ol Su Bae.  The great paper trading competition of 2019.  The ousting of ""he who shall not be named"" (the automod removed my post for mentioning his name).  Etcetera, etcetera...   But this will be my first post.

Over the last week and especially the last 24 hours, I've seen a LOT of comments in the pinned threads lamenting the fact that WSB is forever changed and that it's time for another paper trading competition.  I want to speak to that for a moment and if the mods would be so kind as to keep this post up I'd be very grateful.

First of all, yes, WSB has changed, but that's a *good thing.*  You know who else doesn't want change?  The hedge funds, and Wall Street.  The whole point of this thing that is happening IS CHANGE.  The fact that the world is standing to attention right now says something about this is real and that is much more important than being able to remove some noobs because their IQ is too high.

Even worse than the comments calling for noobs to be eliminated, I've seen many commenters dissing people who can only afford small amounts of shares or even fractional shares.  So now WSB is elitist and you have to be wealthy to join and have fun in the markets?  NO!  That's the entire point of this place and GME and this week is that the market SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE ELITE ONLY.

**Have 5mil and want to invest?  Great!  Have $5 and want to invest.  Great!**

WSB endlessly attacks CNBC, etc for not being able to see that GME is NOT about WSB or the fundamentals of these companies, or about making money.  But it's about something much bigger.  And those people who are crying out for all the noobs here to be banned are no better than the entrenched elite like Stephen Weiss who yesterday called this whole thing a ""load of crap"".

We all saw the open letter pinned earlier this week and the responses to it.  We all lived through last year.  And for the first time in a VERY long time, I feel like the world is coming together to unite rather than to divide and it feels f'ing GOOD.

Let the moment stand for a bit.  I promise you that eventually people will forget about this and we will all start attacking each other again and most of the noobs on WSB will never set foot in this place again.

But for now, for today, for this weekend, and maybe a while more, let's be excellent to one another and not decide the worth of someone over how long they've had a reddit account or how much money is in their bank account.

So to all the noobs:

Welcome!  Hope you enjoy your stay.  It gets a little weird around here, so it would save you a lot of time if you just gave up and went mad now.

They have been playing this short game for decades with a huge war chest funds to see us lose. Be ready for several weeks of FUD, misinformation, and restrictions. Hedge Funds need for us to lose because they need to send a message that they can beat us at this game.

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located. To summarize, it is the act of prolonging an illegal short position with the use of synthetic shares generated through via a loophole that is the issue at hand.

If this is true, and there are signs that it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think of GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purposes of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an oft repeated adage on WSB that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if the price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through spreading misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks (read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/) for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price, which would support the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off, this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the fake news/manipulation around Silver in the last two week and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

So here, since you guys are too damn handicapped to use a fucking search engine, are a list of DD/YOLO/Discussion posts about SLV and Silver written LONG BEFORE THE FUCKING GME SHORT SQUEEZE FINALLY ROCKETED!!! Jesus fuck, you tinfoil wearing sack of ""fake news"" American mouth-breathers with the collective IQ of a doorknob.

Just look at the fucking DD and pretend GME doesn't exist for 5 minutes. Silver. Is. A. Deep. Fucking. Value. Play! It has value. So much fucking deep value! 

Yeah, no shit a market maker is holding silver positions when silver becomes more sought after, their job is to make fucking markets liquid. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY IF YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT TO SUPPLY?! DID YOU NOTICE HOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF PUTS AND A LOT OF CALLS, AND NOT JUST CALLS?!

DO YOU THINK NO BILLIONAIRES HELPED RIDE GME UP? Do you think it was 100% retail on one side and 100% Melvin and Citron on the other? Ah, you do. Of course, you do.  


GREAT, WE GOT 8 MILLION DEGENERATES HERE. The 6M that didn't manage to find this place without hearing about GME having rocketed already, MAYBE DON'T FUCKING POST, COMMENT AND BRING YOUR DAMN IGNORANCE INTO A SUB THAT WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDING 2-10 DECENT TRADE IDEAS PER WEEK PRIOR TO THIS CULT FUCKING INFESTATION OF JACKASSES COSPLAYING RETARDS.

Whatever, here's a list none of you fuckers are capable of reading:

\- 5 months ago, /u/negovany wrote ""[Cornering Silver Market](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/)"". The whole thing is about JPM and squeezing silver. $GME was at $5 back then and /u/DeepFuckingValue was still getting laughed at for buying at every opportunity. Rest of you fuckers had barely gotten over the last cult following, PRPL mattresses.  
\- 6 months ago, /u/lucasandrew talks about ""[Why you should trade futures - WSB Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i3qkex/why_you_should_trade_futures_wsb_edition/)"", in which he mentions ""*Speaking of SLV, people have been posting all the reasons that JPM fucks with the SLV ETF*"". Yeah, I bet he took a fucking time-machine back 6 months in time after Citadel got stuck in the boo-boo. 

\- 6 months ago, /u/LE0TARD0 implores the ""[SILVER CHAD'S RISE UP!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy7nvn/silver_chads_rise_up/)"". A straight fundamental thread on why silver is undervalued, not mention JPM. However, in the comments, a thread is started by /u/kbtech18 and supplemented by /u/ayyayyron talking about precisely JPM and their price manipulation of silver. YEAH, NO THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M SORRY FOR BEING A SHILL, LIKE FUCKING TAKE YOUR TINFOIL HATS OFF YOU DUMB SHITS!

\- 5 months ago, /u/Fuzzers wrote ""[September Silver Futures Contact - Something Aint Right Kids](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9b1th/september_silver_futures_contact_something_aint/)"".  
After hailing his fellow degenerates, HE IMMEDIATELY SAYS: ""*I know there has been 6 billion posts about silver,""* before later writing ""*A large amount of contracts will stand for delivery such as in July. If its enough, maybe some of the big banks who have short positions might find themselves in hot water with their silver delivery amounts."".* Isn't IT JUST GLORIOUS HOW MELVIN AND CITADEL HAVE ALL THESE TIME MACHINES TO MAKE UP IMAGINARY SILVER SQUEEZES 6 MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE MADE UP? YOU GUYS ARE SO FUCKING DUMB RIGHT NOW, HOLY FUCK! DON'T INVEST IN SILVER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, BUT PLEASE STOP WITH THE AMERICAN FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACY THEORIES, IT HURTS MY ALREADY FUCKED UP BRAIN, STOP, I DON'T CONSENT!

\- 5 months ago (YOU GUYS, MAYBE YOU ARE RIGHT, ALL THE POSTS ARE FROM 5-6 MONTHS AGO, MAYBE IT REALLY IS A TIME TRAVELLING CONSPIRACY BY MELVIN AND CITADEL, YES, LET'S GO WITH THAT!), /u/jetter23, wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i6l0o2/weekend_update_silver/)"". What did he have to share, in terms of ideas and DD? "" *4a) Banks will continue to fight us on silver, but they are losing as they were massively short,*  "". WHAT SNEAKY FRICKIN' MARKET MANIPULATING HEDGE FUND SHILL HE IS, JUST GOING BACK SO FAR IN TIME TO SET US UP FOR THE PERFECT TRAP TO HELP CITADEL!!!

\- /u/jetter23 was quite active shilling 5 months ago, he also wrote ""[Weekend Update - Silver (DD#3)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i9uxok/weekend_update_silver_dd3/)"", where he just casually mentioned ""*JPM is currently under DOJ investigation AGAIN for price speculation on Silver. JPM is learning a VERY expensive lesson that when there is a pandemic, global FIAT currencies are crashing(like the DXY), and there is a run on physical metals - you can't be naked short on paper.""* IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF SILVER SHORT SQUEEZE ON JPM, BUT HEY, THAT CAN'T BE IT BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A SCAM FAKE NEWS IDEA THAT'S 2-3 DAYS OLD, RIGHT? 

\- /u/CCJ_Moon_6969 popped his head into the stream of tachyons, relatively talking to us from the present all the way 6 months ago, when he wrote ""[Silver. $SLV call options. New York Comex.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hy8wv9/silver_slv_call_options_new_york_comex/)"". Do you remember /u/kbtech18 from a few threads up? WELL, GEE WHIZ, HE COVERED THAT TIME STREAM TOO, talking about JPM and silver. 6 months ago. I mean, today. Reddit probably changed the timestamps on the posts. DAMN SHILLS!  
\- /u/rawvi wrote ""[JPM and Silver](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i88cyy/jpm_and_silver/)"" 5 months ago, wanting to learn more about... time travel. Nothing to do with naked shorting of silver. BECAUSE THAT WASN'T EVER TALKED ABOUT ON THIS UNTIL 2 DAYS AGO, SO LIKE... HAH, HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?!?! CORPORATE SHILL BOT LOLOLOL!

WE LIKE THE STOCK!!!

555,"Why GameStop was going to cause a collapse of the entire market, and why it is still going to:",2021-02-20 01:29:17,"**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice, and much of this information is not my own, sourced from other DD’s, many that have been removed.

As many of you know, on the 17th of this month, Interactive Brokers Chairman Thomas Peterffy had a CNBC interview (Automod won't let me link it?) where he goes on to explain the fundamentals of the short squeeze.

*However, this whole ordeal might be a whole lot bigger than we had ever imagined.*

Tom (or should we go with Tommy?) goes on to illustrate the idea that they had to regulate the stock, as if they had not it would have caused a collapse of the entire market. While Tom might very well be simply lying to us to give an excuse, let’s play his game, and ponder this idea for a second.

Tom states without the regulation, brokers would have been obligated to deliver **270 million shares**, while only **50 million shares existed**. *540% of shares*.

Vlad, CEO of RobinHood, also told us that on the day of the halt they had an **order volume of 3 Billion**, that they could not fulfill.

Tom continues the interview, **admitting** that without the regulation, GameStop stock would have surged into the ***thousands***, yes plural.

*Maybe the reason all of this has truly become such a battle, is because of how seriously scared the other side of the trade really is.*

Finra’s latest short interest update gives us a value of 78.46%. However, there are many reasons why this could be falsely construed. For one, Finra had announced new ways of calculating short interest, letting the synthetic longs drive this down. Another reason this may be low is this data is not fully up-to-date and does not take into account the fall from 100 to where we are now.

So, what is the true short interest then?

Well, let’s take breakdown GME share ownership alongside the findings of u/Corrode1024:

Insider Ownership: 23,704,787

Institutions: 151,000,000

Funds: 40,000,000

Retail: 38,595,000

Total Owned: 253,299,787

Total Outstanding: 69,746,960

Percentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%

Estimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827

FINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%

Finviz Float: 50,650,000

Reported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624

Total Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)

219,091,451

Percentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%

If you would like a deeper breakdown of u/Corrode1024’s data, check out his DD.

***But yes, the short interest may be a whopping \~432.56%.***

Last week, u/thabat ran an AI-generated model of GME’s stock price, which predicts a squeeze target of an extreme ***$130k a share.***

Now, I know, lol. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. That is a completely crazy fucking number. I mean, right? It has to be?

But I mean, if this whole thing really is bigger than we thought, and it really could cause an entire collapse of the markets. This could be one of the biggest exchanges of wealth in the history of the world.

If SI really is \~400%, shorts covering at infinitely higher and higher prices certainly could drive it up to astronomical heights.

https://preview.redd.it/1xlj4jhdcji61.png?width=1080&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d1ae42ae38e27ff4f6b2b82d8cfe2ffe52654610

If this is what *our* models show, imagine the models and algorithms these big firms have. This may very well be why they are so frightened. They have dug themselves into a hole below bedrock.

All of this seems to line up with what Vlad and Tom have now told us. Without regulation, this squeeze will be the Mother of all Short Squeezes.

So now, alongside our Dogfather Cohen, we shall wait patiently for a catalyst. Just like on the last squeeze to $483, we required a catalyst to get us there. Don’t forget the information we knew in November and December. Board spots are opening up in July which Cohen will take advantage of, Cohen could up his stake. Earnings in March. Who knows what could happen.

It is important to remember the gaming industry is the largest industry in the world, and we are still in its infancy. Older generations continue to laugh down the importance of gaming, but as our generation grows up gaming is only going to evolve and get bigger. GameStop is the only retailer dedicated to gaming and has a surplus of centers that big competitors like Amazon do not.

We are basically right back where we were in November/December. *The stock price does not matter.* If short interest is at 400%, or if short interest is at 80%. Both are insanely high SI values, and a squeeze is inevitable, one that sends us to 500 or one that sends us to 50,000. With high short interest, a squeeze is inevitable. NEVER forget that.

So, continue to hold fellow apes. May your hands turn to diamonds and your balls to steel.

💎🙌

Edit: Also don't forget the other CNBC interview with our boy Tommy where he also **admitted** that they halted to **save themselves**. Or the CNBC interview with Vlad where he said it multiple times assuredly that it **WAS NOT** a liquidity issue, but that is his reasoning now. (You can find these 2 interviews on youtube, AutoMod wont let me link youtube)

561,The sub is becoming a pyramid scheme and something has to be done.,2021-02-10 14:56:25,"What the fuck happened? This used to be a sub full of different opinions, you could tell people that you think they've drunk away what little brain cells they had left when they post stupid DD that isn't even DD. Now it's like r/politics , an endless circle jerk over how ""The hedge funds will bleed"". I don't give a shit about your cause, I just want to make tendies and that's what this sub used to be all about. Now the only content is: GME, GME, Short, ""haha Elon twitter go woosh"". Low-quality bullshit content barely worthy of r/funny. What happened to the likes of JNUG?

Look, I know the game is rigged, we all fucking know that. But this is deranged and has strayed too far from what this sub used to be all about, those sweet tendies. I might sound like your wife's boyfriend when I tell you this, but we have to stop this pyramid scheme level of group thinking delusion.

DD, good memes and both gain and loss porn are getting smothered in a sea of GME-truthing posts. I think I speak not just for myself but for many other long time members of the sub when i say this:

We need to stop circlejerking over one stock and go back being retarded over many stocks/options/gourd futures etc. Have you even heard of JNUG?

Therefore i propose a ban of all GME content that isn't proper DD or memes.

There has been a tier 1 KILLSWITCH operation aiming to make GME disappear. And for many, it worked.

No longer is GME on the lips of every mother and father in the beautiful United States.

No longer is it the meme of the week, they want us to move on, forget about the stock, forget our fallen comrades at level 300, 400, 450...

But nay, We will never forget our fallen. I sure as hell haven't, and I am still holding on like a vice grip.

We cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won't do shit. Now his clown ass is desperately trying to do the same to those videos on YT as they have done to GME.  But the internet never forgets.

This is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares. ^(\*you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)

BUT I'm holding to the bitter end if it comes to that. I lost 88% so what's another 12% mean to me?

Nothing.

I am only writing this to find the ears of my fellow R-tards across the world who grow weak on this battlefield. We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.

My logic is this, I've read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I've gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.

Well hedgies... I SAY:

FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER! KARMA IS A BITCH. TRUST ME. I'VE MET HER. THERE'S NO RUNNING FROM IT. I'VE PAID FOR MY SINS TENFOLD, EVEN WHEN I LAUGHED SAYING ALL OF THAT KARMIC BS WAS  JUST THAT... BS.  But I found out soon enough and I am paying for my wrong doings.

I say this to my enemies.

You know who you are.

""One day. You'll get a\*\* f\*\*\*ed so hard by some event, an event that will enrage you like never before, anger will erupt from the pit of your soul, and for a moment... you'll recall this post, how you were part of the operation that fucked over an entire community of small fish trying to make honest profit while playing by your rules, and you pulled the goddamn plug out of the wall when we started to win.

And you'll realize... ahhh... fuck you karma... well played.""

TL;DR - I am holding, you do you, karma will find those who did wrong and they will pay. In the mean time I am still.....holding the line. I know you shorts still haven't covered."

571,Things to remember on Monday if you hold GME stock,2021-02-01 08:58:35,"# Remember hedge funds have the weak hand

They had to realise gains from other investments just to cover losses from GME. Thursday and Friday were the days with the biggest deleveraging sisnce March 2020. Each day they have to pay high interest just to mantain the short positions, and you know what? Every time they realise gains to cover losses their performance gets worse, and this makes them look like idiots in front of their clients, putting their business in danger.

# Expect some crazy volatility

Remember you are playing against hedge funds, they are not going to give you free money. There is no free money in the stock market. GME investors hit them hardly, and for them is not just about losses but they have to proof to their clients that they cannot be beaten by a bunch of redditors. They may suppress the price or manipulate it. There are some excellent posts on this sub about how they manipulate the stock price (ladder attacks, MSM misinformation, etc).

# Manage your risk

I hold GME since $20s. For me right now there is no risk in holding the stock because it will never go back to that level. If you just bought at $300 have in mind they may be able to supress the price for days or weeks to $100-$200 level, so you must be able to stomach this volatility. I would recommend only investing money you can afford to lose to not panic sell if you see this wild volatily.

The important thing as an investor is to hold, more than to buy like crazy.

# Be a critical thinker, do your DD

There is nothing that the MSM wishes more than to see loss porn from retail investors to say ""see, they didn't know what they were doing"". Please, don't give them the opportunity to say that.

Do your DD, check user history whenever you read something to make sure users are no hedge fund trolls. Hedge funds are now trying to focus you attention on everything except GME. The Silver play is a trap. Citadel is long silver. 

# BEWARE THAT IF YOU BUY SILVER, you are helping Citadel to cover losses with their gains and give them the chance to fight on GME.

Maybe mods should ban silver posts as lots of people could potentially lose money on that play.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

DO YOUR OWN DD. BE CRITICAL.

HOLD. THEY HAVE THE WEAK HAND, NOT YOU.

BEWARE OF SILVER.

For SEC minions reading this: this is not investment advice.

Edit 1: many thanks for the awards guys.

Edit 2: WSJ and Bloomberg are pushing the silver narrative and creating the impression that somehow people here are coordinated which is complete false. Also Citadel is long silver and it seems posts are being created mainly by bots. I definitely think mods should take action.

Edit 3: about silver, it is not my call, I am just sharing my point of view, I totally get the people who says nothing should be banned. Just have in mind MSM are depicting WSB as a group of organized investors that are colluding to target different assets, which is completely false. Should their message gets acceptance because of SLV they could try to ban this sub. So I think mods should at least check if those posts are legit, and if they comply with the rules. Nothing else."

(This is a re-post, if you previously saw this I would appreciate an upvote for visibility. The previous post got a lot of traction but was removed a mod. I spoke to a mod on the team after and he kindly agreed to approve a re-post.)

TLDR: Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, using an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options. Full version below.

There’s an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out… Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn’t really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further “breaking the squeeze.”

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this — made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn’t — involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a “risk alert” memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled “Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.” You can [read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here’s a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock — meaning they are now “short” the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) — and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be “synthetic” longs — meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock — as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn’t part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have “bought back” their short position via buying long shares — except they actually haven’t! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker’s hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they’ve covered their shorts — even if they haven’t truly covered, and can’t, for lack of available float — by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***“Trader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer’s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****”**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks “help hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren’t supposed to have because the shares were never properly located”. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry’s (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren’t really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to “cover” short positions they shouldn’t have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

If this is true, and as explained there are signs that indicate it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes ""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that present the argument that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during this past week when shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of 800 dollar call options to expire in March ([screenshot from a WSB post](https://preview.redd.it/b21gob6z5ze61.png?width=1788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=615555f4e98da988c49a89ea5991d6c7063ff7a9)). In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must also consider the possibility that shorts may no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case? Two thoughts come to mind.

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions** [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how_gme_can_still_be_a_great_play/gm2tsnw/)

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at** [**https://www.sec.gov/tcr**](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned the logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purpose of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an adage oft repeated on WSB that retail investors can stay ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from a different perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.)

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through misinformation, calculated and continuous shorting, short ladder attacks ([read this for an explanation on how 'counterfeit shares', which are a form of synthetic shares created from naked shorts, can be used to ladder attack the stock price](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/), which also supports the thesis of large amounts of counterfeit shares currently being in play) and other potential methods.
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some ""paper hands"", who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the silver fake news/manipulation and the very real possibility of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that, and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information available, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

Has called the next crisis. He posted a book on twitter that I will link here. I have just finished reading the book: The dying of money. Here I will attempt to summarise why he says the end is nigh.

I read the book so you didn't have to.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately I need to first explain some simple economics: but here goes... Most of you already know many of this stuff...you can skip a bit ahead. This first bit is for all the new retards we have recruited.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to stimulate the economy, America, and other governments, by way of their Central banks ‘print money’. They do this by buying their own governments bonds in the open market. They sometimes, as during the COVID crisis, buy corporate debt too. They actually, literally, ‘buy’ this money with money they ‘digitally print’. That money comes from nowhere. (They add a liability and an asset to their balance sheet and boom- printed money).

Their intention is to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates. When you buy a bond, you push it’s price up, which then decreases it’s yield – if that relationship confuses you, here is an example. A 1-year bond is trading in the market at 98$ (this bond has a par value of 100$), so you can buy the bond at 98$ wait a year and receive 100$. A nice 2/98 = 2%\~ yield.

Below, fed buys bonds, yields go lower.

&amp;#x200B;

[Yields fall as government buys bonds.](https://preview.redd.it/k5c2gmio6ej61.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2519e2a3c5964b329dda0de9e05d03316876656)

If interest rates go down, businesses borrow more money to invest, and jobs are created because investments create jobs. But, if an economy is running at 2% interest rates then even investments yielding a meagre 2.5% would be invested in, because they can earn the difference \~0.5%...

**Why doesn’t the printing of money, by way of decreasing interest rates, cause inflation immediately?** Well, actually, it does. It creates inflation immediately in stock prices. The ‘printed’ money doesn’t go to your average citizen, it goes to corporations who sell their debt to the Central Bank. It goes to big investors who sell their government bonds back to the Central Bank because they can earn more in stocks this way. They are clever, they know a   stock yielding even a stable 3% will earn them more than the current bond which only yields 2%.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# START READING HERE SMART AUTISTS!!!!!!!!!

**When does printing become a problem?**

The central bank looks at food prices, general household items, petrol prices, housing and other goods that the average you and me purchase almost every week. Bundle these together and call them CPI (Consumer price index) – inflation. Inflation in **certain** goods.

Now let’s imagine a scenario. You have 100 people in an economy. 2 people are stinking rich and the rest get by fine but don’t have much extra to invest or save each month. They use their savings to purchase mediocre goods, a new bicycle, or a new TV. Why would they invest that extra $100, it’s too little a sum to have any affect, even in the long run, on their lives.

Now we look at the rich, they already have the TV, the car, a wife and a girlfriend and maybe a few houses. Where does their extra savings go? Straight into stocks. And maybe a new car every so often. Fine-dining and other sorts of things which **are not in the CPI (consumer price index)** basket.

&amp;#x200B;

**WATCH THIS:**

Mr Central banker comes along and prints an extra $1000. Give this money to the Rich man what will he do? He already has the car; he already has the houses. He will invest it straight into the market. Bam! Stock market inflation, stock market goes up. This is what has been happening since 2008 (you will see a graph further below that displays this process).

The extra 1000$ does not affect the CPI basket…The rich man is not going to suddenly eat twice as much or buy 10 more TV’s. The “stimulus” money from the Central bank inflates only the stock market.

Give this 1000$ to the poor-normal man, what will he do? He may treat his wife to dinner, buy his kid a bicycle that he couldn’t afford. Fill up his truck. Pay his rent. It is not that he is wrong to do this, this is most likely his best option. A meagre 1000$ in the stock market will have no effect on his life, even in the long term.

The point here, is that Central Bank ‘Printing’ does cause inflation, it causes inflation immediately in the stock market- because that’s where the money goes. Only when that money ‘spills’ into public hands (Think stimulus checks) does inflation in the ‘CPI’ sense of the word, unveil itself.

**Inflation becomes a problem.**

Inflation becomes a problem when it isn’t accompanied by its good friend economic growth. Inflation, has an interesting effect of raising bond yields. Investors don’t want 2% bond yield if inflation is at 3%. So, they simple do this- they don’t buy bonds. What happens when someone doesn’t want to buy your house? You lower the price. No one is buying bonds? Bond prices go lower, and therefore yields rise. – Remember if no one buys the bond the prices go from 98$ to 95$ (supply demand). At the end of the bond’s life, you get 100$, so the yield rises as the price falls.

**The inflation problem occurs** when the average man got his hands on some of that sweet government money. The poor man was able to effect CPI because he will actually purchase goods in the CPI basket. Give every poor man in America 1000$ they will go out and buy from a limited supply of goods. A limited supply of goods, supply demand and prices rise. Inflation – CPI.

&amp;#x200B;

**What do we do?**

There are basically only two outcomes to this scenario:

1. If inflation in CPI, caused by the average American’s stimulus check, opening of the economy, increasing oil and commodity prices, gathers momentum, it will finally unleash the latent inflation potential of America. Everyone who holds dollars, or dollar denominated debt – meaning every single country. Will pay for America’s inflationary sins. Fortunately, poorer countries who are indebted to America should actually benefit from this.

Under this scenario inflation will need to increase by this much (look at red line in graph):

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The red gap is the inflationary potential- The inflation that has not yet been realised but it does exist and needs to be realised eventually](https://preview.redd.it/zp2yb1r57ej61.png?width=463&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab58d80429b169749c0d3b868007983fb5889f5)

You can see that in 2008 the Central government began its shenanigans. In a stable economy, money supply should increase sort of in line with GDP. As you can see above money supply has increased far more than that. That gap, indicated by the red line, is inflationary potential. It now basically just sits in stocks.

Under this scenario, by my calculations, money supply needs to come back down to real GDP. The Central Bank won’t do this. They won’t tighten. That would hurt too much. But the naturally forces of inflation will do it for them. And prices in the economy will inflate to catch up with the money supply.

2) Scenario 2: A highly probable outcome: Japanification.

Japan has been doing QE for a much longer time than America. The reason why they haven’t blown up in an atomic bomb of inflation is because this money never reached the hands of the middle class or the poor. So that inflation couldn’t occur in CPI.

However, inflation did occur everywhere where the rich were. As it was them who had more access to this money.

America’s Central Bank could, by way of printing even more money, buy more bonds and push down yields. They could let inflation run for a little while and hope it doesn’t gain momentum. If inflation gains real momentum, which it could because they are giving money to the middle and lower classes, then they cannot follow Japans lead. If inflation remains muted and low. The real issues of wealth inequality will only persist and worsen.

&amp;#x200B;

It is not to say that the managers of these governments are inherently sinister in their motives to conduct QE, which disproportionately benefits the rich. It may just be the only way they know. And by human nature people would rather be instantly gratified, leaving future generations to pay for inflationary sins.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happens in scenario 1 summary:**

Inflation goes out of control (CPI inflation, stock inflation has already had its turn). Yields rise, Central Bank get’s spooked and tries to raise rates a little. Economy tanks due to raised rates. 6 months later or maybe a year later and the currency has found equilibrium by depreciating around 70% relative to the price of real goods- not relative to the price of other currencies. Or the currency has found equilibrium because they removed that money from the system-highly unlikely.

Stocks fall because yields rose. And everyone has the next best opportunity to invest into the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

**What happens in scenario 2 summary:**

Inflation rises a bit due to stimulus checks. Central bank remains unconvinced that inflation will gain momentum. If inflation does not gain momentum the Central Bank will continue to print until they see GDP growth. Stocks go up but until the wealth gap is too extreme and a revolution takes place. This could take 10 years or 100 years.

One more thing- Warren Buffett, and Michael Burry, both filed their 13-F recently. They are holding a LOT of inflation hedged stocks. Telecommunications, real estate, consumer goods.

I've borrowed and dumbed down this chart from [this savant's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l97jbo/gamestop_big_picture_market_mechanics/).

As the free-flowing stock dries up (due to ppl buying and holding), the volatility increases. It becomes easier and easier to move the needle with less money. As long as you keep holding and buying, the volatility will only increase. **Expect huge swings in the next few days.**

Hedge funds know this. They tanked the stock this morning. Right now they intentionally leveling the demand to keep the stock price stable; to make it look like the ride is over.

HOWEVER

The short float is still high, and the [volume has been steadily decreasing](https://i.imgur.com/eRH3S2b.png).

Furthermore, [institutional ownership](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) only picked up about 12m shares, and some of those went to institutions that were long not short. Now maybe I'm misreading this, or maybe they're fudging the data, but I just don't see how the shorts covered their position with this measly volume.

Keep in mind the VW squeeze happened with far less short-interest than is currently in GME. The main problem is that retail investors, unlike huge firms, can't vacuum up all the supply fast enough, which enables the hf to slowly wiggle their way out buying up paper hands. They've likely exited their worst short positions and reshorted at a better price.

Some people are saying the squeeze might be more of a slow gradual upward pressure, rather than a sudden event. The truth is that the hedge funds are walking on a tightrope, and this stock is still extremely volatile. Any big movements in demand can drastically impact the price.

SEC Data Show $359 Million of GameStop Shares Failed to Deliver
(Bloomberg) -- On Jan. 28, the day after GameStop Corp. mania hit its crescendo on the back of a short squeeze for the record books, about $359 million worth of shares were caught in limbo.

More than 1 million shares were deemed failed-to-deliver that day due either to buyers lacking cash to complete purchases or sellers not having the shares to settle trades, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission data.

The SEC report, which covers trading from Jan. 15 through the end of the month, is just one more indication of the dislocation in the market for the video game retailer’s shares.

GameStop stock, for months among the most heavily shorted on the New York Stock Exchange, surged more than 1,700% from Jan. 1 through Jan. 27 as a legion of Reddit users piled on, forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading.

While the SEC’s list highlights the extent of the short squeeze, on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, where the GameStop trade was galvanized, it’s evidence of something else: the unproven theory that hedge funds were engaged in naked short-selling of the shares.

Short sales -- when an investor borrows shares, sells them and then tries to buy them back at a lower price to profit from the difference -- are an everyday market occurrence. Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren’t known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.

“Fails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,” reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. “Therefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or ‘naked’ short selling.”

Failures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there’s also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.

One thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn’t be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop’s shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.

The data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a “cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,” according to the SEC’s website.

About 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks."

#What you can do to keep this place great

* Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.

* Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.

* Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!

* Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.

* Don't ask ""what the next move is"" - WSB is not your personal army, there is no agenda, no one speaks for WSB, and we don't ""pump and dump"" anything. Simply, we are a watering hole for risk loving individuals.

#What we're doing to keep this place great

* The whole mod team has been working overtime, clearing out low quality content and keeping things fresh. Less than 1% of threads make it out of /new.

* In the absence of u/zjz's incredible bots, we're building new tools to assist with moderation efforts, but remain hopeful that zjz can return soon.

* We're planning some fun community events. Can't say too much, but those of you who have been around will know. Guess we'll have to wait and see.

* We will be reintroducing stickied DD threads. These will be automatically stickied based on flair, with high account age restrictions.

#Why was my post/comment removed? CORRUPT!

Over the past week, there were multiple *really good* DDs and YOLOs on PRPL, FNKO, SNDL, and many other stocks. The kind of stuff that gives you hope that the old WSB is very much alive.

But you may have missed them because the front page was dominated with GME related talk. 

Don't let the bandwagoners steal your fresh DD. Downvote spam and low effort posts, upvote innovative posts.

#A note on the moderation team:

The team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.

This mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.

Making everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, stick around. You'll have a blast.

604,"How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding Shares",2021-02-07 02:46:35,"*EDIT: This post is meant as a mathematical (\~Middle School Algebra) exercise regarding GME stock and shorts. The title itself is meant to be the literal end as intended, and describes how it would be impossible for all shorts (estimated) to be covered, closed and completely done and finished, with only using the available outstanding shares on the specific days stated. Please note that I have made no comments on possible options that HF's can/did use as* ***I DO NOT HAVE THAT DATA!*** *I have, hopefully, labelled the assumptions I made to do these calculations, and pointed out some general assumptions,more shorts mean more gains, sarcastically, that do not always appear to be true in the given data.*

# These are just general findings, so chill the fuck out!

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that the below plots are all done using publicly available data from FINRA, Jan29th text file ( [http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt)) Feb 5th text file ([http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210205.txt)) regarding short volumes and Yahoo Finance for daily volume and GME daily prices.

I promise you the long read is worth it, but the TLDR version is at the bottom in Figure 9. The majority of the text is needed to inform a general audience of how an estimate of over 70 million shorts a day was reached. Please help out if there are any huge oversights, or wrong calculations, in the comments below, as I'm not responding to nearly any chats these days due to all the bots wanting me to either join an illegal conspiracy to raise the price of silver, or just shady as fuck.

Below is just a plot of the daily stock prices at the open and close of trading during regular hours for GME (source Yahoo Finance).

[Figure 1: No real new information from this plot that everyone doesn't already know.](https://preview.redd.it/hm1mk6i09yf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bbe89497fafa8b1d449cf203c66ad2b62cbe111)

So as EVERYONE KNOWS, shorts can cause the price to rise in a given stock as the share of stock must be purchased, and with supply and demand, we aim for the heavens...

[Figure 2: Shorts and Short Exempts \(note y-axis is in MILLIONS\) as reported by FINRA during regular business hours.](https://preview.redd.it/t8yyps5bayf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e17249ce1c3e2349d7d082a2690d77bfa4a8c3ad)

So let's do a quick sanity check. Looking at Figure 2, we see that on **Jan 13th, over 40 MILLION shorts were executed!** So if we check Figure 1on Jan 13th, we should expect to see that the price increased, which it did.

Let's look at it a different way and plot the Closing Price minus the Opening Price to see just how much GME stock price changed each day.

[Figure 3: Overall change in stock price from open to close of GME.](https://preview.redd.it/8dutm3frcyf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=458d804b49dea6f728ea29f3946a506a6ac2113b)

This plot seems to be dominated by the wild changes in price during late January/early February, so let's do a normalization trick by taking the above values and dividing them by their respective opening price that day.

[Figure 4: GME Price change relative to the opening price that day.](https://preview.redd.it/iokqj1i4dyf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=533c7228e8ff52bbb6cc23fe7bc0a145f0716efe)

Now in Figure 4 we can see the change in price relative to what it was starting out on that day. Again we see that Jan 13th increased, by over 50% that day.

So let's make it easier for everyone and combine Figure 2 and Figure 5 to see both the total number of shorts executed, and the price change, for the same day.

[Figure 5: GME Price change relative to opening price, and the total number of shorts\(both short and \\""short exempts\\""\) during Regular Business Hours, via FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/udf0do41fyf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af67822fa65e5df33bf2b994c30602f7b8582904)

**NOW WE GOT A PLOT!** Here we see both the change in price AND the number of shorts being executed for a single day.

But what do we actually get from Figure 5? **Jan 13th keeps with our hypothesis that MORE SHORTS MEANS MORE GAINS**, but we don't see that across the board though.....?

Jan 13th, Jan 22nd, Jan 26th, and Feb. 5th all show gains in price, and large number of shorts...

**22 days I tracked, and 11 of those days have over 10million shorts during regular business hours, but only 4 days have gains of 20% or greater, and only 3 of THOSE days have gains over 50%.....?**

# Eye Raise:

* **Why hasn't GME reached the Moon with all the Rocket/Shorts Fuel yet?**

\-""The screaming cries of wallstreetbets""

Hmmmmm, ok, well  maybe we should also compare the overall volume of GME also and not just the shorts. The HYPE was/IS real over GME, and the world took notice. Let's see how the volume changed with it.

First, just plot out the daily volume during regular business hours.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 6a: Regular Hours Daily Volume for GME, as reported by FINRA](https://preview.redd.it/8401qqamiyf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=308bf45b5b5f75766d96d57ca55bbee0b9c873eb)

Alright, what do we get out of this plot...? Well, from Jan 13th and onward the volume shot THROUGH THE FUCKING ROOF, compared to early January.

**BUT WAIT A DAMN MINUTE?!?!?!?**

I didn't hear about the GME Hype Train until mid to late January!? From what I can find googling it seems that most major news outlets didn't really report on WSB/GME until Jan 21st, with serious mentions coming around Jan 24th weekend.

# General Assumption I'M MAKING:

# Most of the actual ""Retail Investors"" didn't join GME until weekend after Jan 22nd.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 6b: Full Daily Volume as reported by Yahoo Finance for GME. Note that Figure 6a is contained within Figure 6b.](https://preview.redd.it/bxnpcbheuyf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe167ab117d9d361f7f2926d85bc837319dcf33)

# So, ASSUMING, the above, let's say the higher volume AFTER Jan 25th is from Urist McLossesMoney.

So what's with the crazy high volume before then? Is it from the insiders, the true chosen among us, the users in r/wallstreetbets that aren't bots?-----&gt;NOPE.

Almost certainly volume before Jan 22nd is from the hedge funds having to buy up the shorts they WAY THE FUCK overextended on! The ""big bois"" had to join us bottom feeders and buy up the stock to cover their 9000% short shares... maybe.

Anyway we can check something else that to shine some light into what happens during the dark hours of trading... After Hours Volume.

[Figure 7: Regular Hours Trading compared against After Hours Trading for GME](https://preview.redd.it/dzjkv3zqlyf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30b68bc546184bc5e079101a4c9d9d66b1955365)

**I DO LOVE PLOTS!!!!** Here, I've taken the regular hours volume(again from FINRA) and subtracted it from the day's total volume, as reported by Yahoo Finance, to get the After Hours Volume. But again what stands out/what's the point of this plot?

# After Hours Volume overtakes Regular Hours Volume Jan 22nd, and has remained where MOST of the action is going on!

**GENERALLY**, ""Retail Investors"" don't/CANT engage in after hours trading. And also, don't confuse what you do on your trading app at 2am with what broker-dealers and big bois are doing at 2am.

We see around Jan 13th, after hour volume went above 50million, my general dumbass guess is because HF's needed to buy shares to cover shorts, and the few following days thereafter.

Hmmmm. OK, let's take a step back and look shorts again....

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 8: Percentage of Regular Hour Short Volume as a Percentage of Total Volume during Regular Hours.](https://preview.redd.it/kolo2hw7ryf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da005e3f065d05341a1fa196c07c9b3b3523793b)

Figure 8 just shows that over half of all volume, just during regular hours, are shorts. **I don't know if there are numbers out there that show after hours shorts, if so PLEASE COMMENT IT!!!!!!**

# And because I can't get after hours short volume, we have to make a wild guess as to this next step.

# So multiply Figure 8 by Figure 6b and you get.....

[Figure 9: Estimated the full daily short volume by multiplying the regular hours short ratio from Figure 8 by the whole daily volume reported by Yahoo Finance.](https://preview.redd.it/yscv7o1ssyf61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86594c24fa071bee2a7b7b2e25f607241c13e9b3)

# NOTE: Figure 9 is an estimate, but it's still a low-ball estimate.

**ASSUMPTION --&gt; Let's assume that after hours volume plays just like regular hours trading.**

I STILL HIGHLY FUCKING DOUBT THAT AND WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AfterHoursVolume was higher than 75% of just shorts.

Still, let's roll with Figure 9. **Looking at Jan 13th, we estimate the number of shorts executed was...over 76 MILLION!**

**And there are.... 69.75M shares outstanding... yep... ok... checks out!**

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Go to Figure 9, NOTE THAT IT'S AN ESTIMATE(and a low one at that), and see how it's impossible that they covered their shorts (ON THOSE DAYS) see edit below.**

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 1: Yes, title is a typo. ""...Shorts WE ARE Covered..."" smh

Edit 2: finra link seems to break for some with the https:// in the front, try it without and added direct links to text files. Also, no I did not include ways to cover shorts with options/bought/sold/traded/fails-to-deliver/NoExpirationShortsJustPayInterest/t+3/etc.... since I already threw a god-awful amount of text at you and literally pointed to exact dates and I don't have Bloomberg/L50Data...

606,"Theory: Gamestop was in the process of going bankrupt, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Melvin were in the process of profiting from inside information obtained from GME real estate division.",2021-02-21 00:45:24,"Edit: They made me my own flair so I'm guessing I'm onto something lmao

So I was just poking around randomly on Google. I found some interesting information that leads me to a retarded ape-like conspiracy.

Short end of it, I think Gamestop was in the process of closing everything down and I think the real estate division were giving Melvin inside information which is why they went so heavy on the shorts to begin with.

Let me explain my thought process. Maybe I'm retarded but you apes help me to see if I'm crazy or autistic.

The real estate connection begins with this PDF document:

[https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb\_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/CCIMCONNECT/8f473331-34dc-49b0-a5cc-4a6fe64f26ec/UploadedFiles/VqsY4FaMQna7C7UeT3Kb_CCIM%20Preferred%20Partners%20Book%202019.pdf)

CCIM is a commercial real estate group that basically just puts people together in a room and does conferences and shit.

The PDF starts off innocently. Just a thank you note, President's Forward and random ads.

But then it begins to list a directory of members. On Page 46 there's a strange coincidence.

Gamestop's real estate leasing manager, Christopher Morris is listed.

Right underneath is Scott A. Morris of...... Citadel Partners LLC.

I was like holy shit when I saw that and I looked into it and Citadel Partners is a real estate group in Texas, doesn't seem to be a connection to our evil Citadel overlords. Just... a really funny coincidence. Maybe someone wrinklier brained than I can find an actual connection lol

But then I did some other digging and found a random document:

[https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0](https://cases.primeclerk.com/ascena/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTYzODk5Ng==&amp;id2=0)

Which is a voting form for Ascena Retail Group's bankruptcy filing.

On page 49 and 50 something jumped out at me:

GOLDMAN SACHS &amp; CO -- F/A/O MELVIN CAPITAL MGMT LP -- ATTN PRIME BROKER ACCOUNT

Idk if it's well known, because I had no idea but apparently Goldman Sachs handles Melvin's accounts.

I looked further into it and found:

[https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd](https://aum13f.com/fund/melvin-capital-ii-ltd)

**Custodian** Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co LLC, JP Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co LLC, National Financial Services LLC

Melvin is in publicly bed with Goldman and JP Morgan.

And it just so happens Jason Butler of JP Morgan Chase bank is also listed in that CCIM real estate group directory. I can't find anything about what Jason Butler does except this page which shows him as an analyst:

[https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage](https://invest.arenapharm.com/analyst-coverage)

So would it be impossible to think that Christopher Morris, Gamestop's regional leasing manager, Jason Butler an analyst at JP Morgan got together at any one of the events CCIM held in 2014 ([https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/](https://www.ccim.com/networking/past-meetings-conferences/)) and had a little discussion about how Gamestop was considering bankruptcy as the digital age may be putting them in a bad position financially?

And then at that point word got around to Melvin who's probably paying for information like this from any one of their insider analysts at Goldman or JP Morgan and decided it's a safe bet to start shorting Gamestop?

Then all this shit hits the fan and now Gamestop is doing better than they've ever done and now have no plans to continue that route of possible bankruptcy and Ryan Cohen swooping in to save the day destroying all of Melvin's hard insider traded tendies.

It's a cooky theory but plausible.

Guess what you fucking idiot -- you aren't allowed to collapse the entire financial market in less than a week using a phone app. It takes more time.

---------

# There are likely several million new synthetic longs of $GME, diluting the market, that were created on 01/28/21.

They were created by a market maker (or possibly several market makers) to stop the beginning of a short squeeze that would have bankrupted hedge funds if a margin call hit them, which ultimately could have financially impacted those market makers once liability for the shares was transferred. These shares weren't borrowed from anyone. They're imaginary. Pure fiction. A promise only a handful of entities can make.

The reason they did this was to buy time to save their own asses. [The reason they were allowed to do this is because regulations let them](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

The creators of those shares have 21 days to deliver. Until then, they aren't paying interest. There isn't a public record of their creation -- the closest insight we have to the number of synthetic longs in existence for $GME are the [failure-to-deliver numbers](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/), and $GME is a major outlier in that field. A fucking terrifying outlier.

We aren't bleeding out a hedge fund by holding. Melvin very likely *is* out of their position after losing half of their fund. There aren't 'new shorts replacing the old'. Instead, a buffer of imaginary stock was created by a market maker to 'flatten the curve' when a massive number of shorts had to cover once retail buyers started rushing in.

---------

# That's why you aren't seeing short interest increase even though there aren't any short shares left to borrow.

**These assholes are praying that in the next month, retail buyers get scared, bored, or distracted.** They're spreading FUD, attacking with short ladders, hoping you watch the short interest drop and think it's over. They're counting on you to sell your $GME at a bargain rate so you can pay rent, because they think *you're just fucking retail scum betting on a shit company,* and they've been playing this game longer than you've been alive.

They're also counting on you to obsess over things you can measure that they can hide. They want you to set rules and limits on when you're going to run away.

---------

# Simultaneous to the creation of these synthetic longs, DTCC increased collateral requirements on 01/28/21 to purchase $GME to 100%.

This led smaller brokers like Robinhood to restrict trading, depressing the price, conveniently making it less expensive for market makers to recover their synthetic longs. 

**The people that pushed this collateral increase knew exactly what would happen**, because *it's their job* to know what the impact will be when they make changes like this.

DTCC openly stated they increased collateral requirements for $GME to reduce risk to their organization. **DTCC recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearinghouses if the market makers went bankrupt.** They know exactly what the failure-to-deliver numbers mean for this security. 

It's possible that DTCC created new collateral requirements in coordination with the flood of synthetic longs explicitly to make it easier to recover those shares. It is also possible these actions were taken without any coordination with market makers, because DTCC knows it could have dampened and stretched out a squeeze through this act alone.

**Their strategy is to stretch out a short squeeze into a 'long high' they can recover from if retail shares are sold over time, since retail can't buy them back.**

And the people working at DTCC likely rationalized this was 'the right thing to do' -- to prevent a systemic failure that could have impacted the entire stock market -- because preventing systemic failures is the only reason organizations like DTCC exist.

Meanwhile, Robinhood -- the smallest player in the game -- honestly DTCC's buttboy in this scheme -- is going to be grilled by Congress over this shit.

---------

# Did you think we were the only ones that saw a black swan event coming when we bought shares?

The root problem is there are several players in the market capable of creating new shares without paying interest, capable of restricting trading -- and they all face severe financial liabilities if a squeeze happens. They want to turn the squeeze into a slow burn so the damage doesn't hit them.

If we continue to hold, a squeeze could happen sometime around or after Feb 18th, or another market maker could create *even more* synthetic longs to dilute the market, passing the hot potato. This could make their problem even worse once *those shares* are bought and held.

This could continue for an extremely long period of time until a financial regulator steps in and forces them to buy the shares they've sold.

---------

**TL;DR**: 

WSB is being made into a fall guy for the collapse of the market due to the creation of a massive number of preexisting synthetic longs that were bought and held. To fix it, market makers decided to make more, but their cure is also a poison they can't stop taking.

**Strategy**: 

Hold your positions, buy at any price you can afford to hold forever, and hope that retail owns more shares than the total number that exist for $GME. Contact the SEC and ask them to investigate and to halt trading of $GME -- time is on your side if the clock ticks down the deadlines for market makers, while the stock cannot be sold by paper hands.

**Postitions**:

100 $GME 💎🙌 -- but only holding for $10,000/share -- I'm not so greedy that I want the entire market to collapse."

619,"The anatomy of a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack - why GME’s real price is $2,147,483,737",2021-02-04 00:08:49,"Hey diamond hands,

as I am sure you have heard, there are rumors that short ladder attacks are being used to suppress the price of GME. While I held this belief for many days, I am now beginning to realize that even more insidious and backhanded techniques are being used against us. I mean seriously, there is simply no reasonable explanation for why a stock should drop in price. None.

The good news is that Melvin is more scared than ever. The bad news is that today was no short ladder attack. No, it was far worse.

Today we experienced a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack

Most people here have at least a few days of investing experience under their belts, so I'm not going to dumb down these concepts for you. If you can understand a short ladder attack, you can understand this tactic as well.

Basically, a Short Escalator Omega Overflow attack (or Overflow attack for short) is the opposite of a short ladder attack. In a short ladder attack, shares are traded back and forth, with each trade a penny lower. In an overflow attack, the attack chooses to instead trade shares to an accomplice at incredibly high prices. How high you ask?

$2,147,483,648

That's right, hedge funds have been selling single shares for billions of dollars right behind our backs. Why this price though? It's simple.

Every investment app, RH, TD, etc, use 32 bit integers to store prices. The maximum value of a 32 bit integer is 2,147,483,647. So what happens when it goes up by one? It goes negative.

This means that every share in an overflow attack is worth:  -$2,147,483,647

What do you think this does to the price of a stock? If you answered bad things, you are correct. The sale of one of these shares is enough to send the price of a stock far into the negatives. Didn't think that stocks could go negative? I'm not surprised - that's another hedge fund secret. They don't tell you THAT on investopedia!

But as the critical thinkers you are, I'm sure you will now ask:

""Why isn't the stock price negative right now?""

The answer is because the squeeze is happening RIGHT NOW. Paper hands laughed at the idea of an infinity squeeze, but it happened and it was big. So big in fact that it overflowed the price itself.

MATH TIME

So we know that GME overflowed in the squeeze. But by how much? Well we know that the price right now is $90. But we have to take the overflow squeeze into consideration.

If there is -$2,147,483,557 of pressure on prices, then to reach $90 the stock must cost 2,147,483,647 + 90, or $2,147,483,737. Yes.

EACH SHARE OF GME IS CURRENTLY WORTH $2,147,483,737

We can't forget about overflow however, so the price stored in your brokerage account is actually -$1,073,741,734. Now this might sounds like a scary number, but as long as you didn't buy on margin you will be fine. As long as you keep holding, the SEC will be FORCED to do something about it. They are already under extreme pressure to help retail investors - it's only a matter of time.

And as a side note: If for some reason Melvin stops this overflow attack, your stocks will be worth over a billion negative dollars. At this point, buying GME makes a profit whereas selling puts the next 10 generations of you family into debt enslavement. So as the wise investors on WSB say: BUY!

WE DESERVE OUR BILLIONS

620,Let's get one thing clear,2021-01-30 11:36:27,"I feel like we should clarify something. This subreddit has seen a surge of 5,5m people in these last days. That's a lot of people and thats great. But I think theres a few people that don't know a lot about the short squeeze and are here for a quick buck.

if you thought you could profit by the end of this week, this was not the case. The shorts at Wednesday gained an advantage. Imagine if we could stop the market when we had a red day. We would all be billionaires by now. That's what they did. 

I still think the squeeze is still in play though. This means, this will not be as quick and they expect new people to lose interest/panic sell so they can cover lower. It's all or nothing for them. They could pull more insane stuff by next week, you can count that as a possibility. 

That's why its important to understand the play here and not just jump on the hype wagon. You're doing more harm that way. Learn about short squeezes and educate yourself on what has happened till now. 

TLDR: I believe the squeeze is still on. But due to Thursday, it may have gone back a week or so. Due to a surge in people here, they may expected a squeeze to occur on friday. And I could imagine that hedge funds bet on new people losing interest. That's why its important to educate yourselves, To make your own opinion about the stock. 

Obviously this is just my opinion. Don't treat this as financial advice."

Let's go through the questions you simpletons want to know, as explained by a mouth-breathing fool who has managed to convince you he knows what he's talking about:

# Did we win today? Is it endgame?

Kind of. Be patient.

# In what ways did we win?

First, there was the obvious victory of bouncing back 65% today after the worst market manipulation I've ever witnessed. We kept the upward momentum going.

Secondly, every day you finish higher is another day the shorts are underwater. If you are perpetually going up, the walls are closing in on them.

Finally, a lot of put options expired worthless today while a number of call options expired in-the-money. It's always good to make put holders lose money because you drain the bank accounts of people betting against you.

# Yes! Call options! We finished above $320 and get a gamma squeeze to infinity now, right?

No. That's not how this works. Too many people don't quite understand what a gamma squeeze is.

A gamma squeeze happens when call option sellers (or ""writers"") have to hedge their naked calls by buying stocks. They do this because the risk of selling naked calls is theoretically infinite if they don't. It's called delta hedging. You don't need to know all the fancy math (""delta"" and ""gamma"" are those greek symbols for nerds), just understand this: as it becomes more probable that the call option you sold will cost you money, you hedge more.

This is a continuous PROCESS, not a discreet moment in time. The market makers and hedge funds and institutions selling you calls don't wake up on Friday morning and think, ""Shit! I think I'm going to lose everything if these stocks keep going up! I have to BUY NOW!!!"" That would be stupid. They are hedging all the way up. I guarantee you that most of the calls that were exercised at $320 today were already covered. They already went out and bought those shares and most of the upwards pressure that places on the market is priced in already.

# So, no gamma squeeze?

Probably not significantly. They're not going to be madly rushing out on Monday to buy shit they already own for the most part.

# Why are people talking about a gamma squeeze at $320, then?

We did have a gamma squeeze at $320. On Wednesday, two days ago. The price exceeded $320 (then the highest strike price on the books) and promptly surged to $371 before coming back down to around $320. That's what a gamma squeeze is: a frenzied rush by call sellers to cover calls.

It typically happens BEFORE expiration, not after. It's rare for market makers to get so caught with their pants down that they have to get squeezed for the previous week's calls on a Monday. I don't know where this idea of a gamma squeeze now at $320 is coming from.

# This hurts my feelings. So, what's so great about the $320 threshold, anyway? Did it matter at all?

It's still a good thing. There may have been a few lingering naked calls to cover. And, like I said, it's always good to make put-holders lose money because stick it to the 🌈🐻, that's why.

$320 was a significant level because there were quite a few open call options at that strike. You can see the entire option chain here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/option-chain)

Go through and count up all the January 29th options that were in-the-money at today's close. I think maybe 90,000 or something? Screw it, I didn't count. Somebody who can figure out how to use a calculator can add those up. Multiply that number by 100 (because option contracts are sold in groups of 100) and that's how many shares need to change hands thanks to contracts expiring ITM.

It may be that with so many shares needing to change hands and so little liquidity in this market, some weird things could happen.

# What weird things?

Well, if nothing else, a lot of shares will need to be tied up as the process of settling calls plays out.

You have to remember that when somebody says they own shares, they don't necessarily *own* own the shares right at that moment.

When you press ""buy"" on your phone and it says your order was filled, that doesn't mean that the process happens instantaneously. For all intents and purposes as far as you are concerned, sure, the process looks instant. However, there's a lot of messy stuff that happens on the back-end of the system between the brokers and the clearing houses. The clearing houses are where the daily tab gets settled: who owes whom and what they owe and at what price, etc.

Monday could be interesting as this tab for millions of stocks (in a market with only 50-something million shares actively circulating) gets settled. It might not be crazy, but it could. We'll see.

Michael Burry (Christian Bale, for all you noobs) seems to think that all the naked short-selling above the float will result in a shit-storm when people actually go to get their shares back: [https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1355221824661983233)

Liquidity crunch + lots of shares being moved around + nobody knows where they all are currently = potential nightmare for Wall Street.

# I just want my infinite short squeeze and my tendies, so how do we get the MOASS?

Something needs to be the catalyst. Something needs to get the short sellers really underwater, so much so that they are drowning. That's why there's been so much hype about gamma squeezes; the gamma and short squeezes are two separate things, but the gamma squeezing has been really good to us lately. It has triggered some crazy upwards price movements. I still think one was about to happen yesterday morning that would have triggered the squeeze-pocalypse, the Mother of All Short Squeezes. The bastards at the brokerages (acting with and for the clearing houses), took your tendies. It's criminal what played out.

I actually think a gamma squeeze was possible today, as well, as the price shot up to $378 around noon. If it had gotten to $400, it stood a very good chance of running up to $500, which would have caused a run up to $650 and beyond. Then Robinhood said, ""Oh, actually, you plebs cannot buy 5 shares anymore, only 2 now."" The price came back down again.

Oddly enough, the S&amp;P500 sold off over a full percentage point (that's a lot of money) right after GME hit that $378 peak. Do you think this doesn't freak the finance world out? They know a gamma squeeze is like the fuse on a firework. It consumes itself until it ignites the rocket.

# How will Wall Street defend themselves?

They will try to keep snipping the fuse. That's what all these restrictions on brokerages are about. They are trying to defuse the situation slowly because having it all get sorted out quickly and frantically is no good for them.

We need enough upwards price momentum that those option chains keep going up and up and feeding on themselves. They need to become a self-sustaining chain reaction, fed by hedging pressure. And you need to put pressure on your elected representatives to tell them that Wall Street cannot be allowed to just shut down the game when they are losing. I hate to tell you this, but the squeeze has so far been stopped purely by the losers declaring that it will not happen at any cost. It's bullshit. Eat the rich. But there it is.

# Do you feel you've used the word ""squeeze"" too much by now?

Yes. I've been writing and looking at the word ""squeeze"" so much that it is starting to lose its meaning. Squeeze. Squeeze. Squeeeeeeze.

TL;DR Shares most likely already bought so no gamma squeeze, doesn't matter anyway  🙌💎🚀   🙌💎🚀   🙌💎🚀

We were expecting a short ladder attack. It has happened every day since Wednesday 1/27.

We won last week. We made all calls between 115 and 320 strike expire in the money. That means MM has to buy shares in order to hedge against those expired ITM calls.

Many of us are probably watching the short interest % of float to indicate when the short squeeze is squoze. At this point, the hedge funds clearly know this, given how hard they've spent the last couple days using their MSM shills to announce ""WE HAVE EXITED OUR SHORT POSITIONS!!! YOU WIN!""

There is a chance we're going to see that short interest % of float number go down at the same time as the price drops. Failure-to-delivers may also go down, at least in appearance.

# This is probably a lie.

Failure-to-deliver numbers and the short interest % are just the tip of the giant dildo they're trying to fuck us with. If this thing is actually what it looks like, they have way, way, *way* more exposure to this shitstorm than they are letting on.

There are ways for hedge funds and their colluding market makers to hide their exposure to a counterfeit stock scheme / naked short / short attack. You can read all about it here: [counterfeiting stock 2.0](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) (again, credit to johnny for bringing this to our attention)

If you don't know how to read, just scroll down to the picture of the iceberg.

If you **do** know how to read but don't have a lot of time, still scroll down to the picture of the iceberg, and start reading from there.

**TL: DR**\-- using a bag of dirty tricks, hedge funds can ""unwind"" their *disclosed* short positions, without ever having to exit their *real* short positions-- the ones that are actually super dangerous and putting them at risk of insolvency. They are going to do everything they can to get us to sell, **up to and including fucking with the disclosed short interest % of float-- the number we're all watching.**

So watch the short interest with a titanic-sized grain of salt. It could go up, it could go down, but it's likely not anywhere close to their real risk exposure either way.

My GME positions:  4 @ 329, 2 @ 325, 13 @ 272.

I originally bought in at $14 and sold at $19 like a paper-handed bitch.Now I'm holding until $10,000.

*I'm an ape, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, this is not financial advice, do your own research, etc.*

**EDIT:** if you have a lot of time on your hands and want some more research on how this works and maybe a little peek into what we're in for, see u/Sleavitt10's comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/glib7cs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

**EDIT 2:** people are pointing out that that source I’m using says short squeezes aren’t really possible anymore, because counterfeiting can overcome any amount of buy-side pressure. And normally I would agree, but there are exceptions.

Like when a counterfeiting scheme runs into a multi-million-man army of enraged retail investors who are willing to buy the stock at any price, for example. And remember, the longer this goes on, the more they lose, so they are highly motivated to produce a quick resolution. The desperate moves on Thursday and Friday that ultimately failed are proof of what a serious situation this is becoming for them.

The sheer number of retail investors who are buying this stock just to fuck up the short attack is absolutely mind boggling. So long as we maintain our numbers and resolve, they must spend more and more money to get out of the hole.

Hold. The. Line.

**EDIT 3:** [IT'S ALREADY FUCKING HAPPENING.](https://twitter.com/jonpeterswrites/status/1356019766624923654) 6 hours ago shorts weren't covering, and suddenly they've covered 30 mil on 50 mil volume? I don't fucking THINK so. And even if they are, that doesn't unwind the 2-3x as many shorts built on top of imaginary shares.

664,I randomly met one of you retards in real life yesterday.,2021-01-30 21:08:49,"Aloha autists,

Yesterday I was in the airport of a city thousands of miles from my home. I saw a guy scrolling / laughing to himself and I thought… “You know, this guy looks a little retarded - I wonder…”

I approached cautiously. Still from afar, like a true creep I spied on his screen - Even from a distance I could tell that he was, indeed on reddit. After a moment, he looked up. I simply said:

“WSB?”
“YEAH!”

It was 100% a little weird at first, but honestly, we felt a kind of kinship immediately - and although I have felt like part of something special over the last few weeks, actually meeting one of you dummies in real life hit different.

We talked a bit about our positions (ha), how we helped save a movie theater chain. History being written. Balance of power shift. What it all means. etc. etc. etc.

As much as we joke here at WSB, yesterday was a perspective shift for me. I usually think of you guys as a bunch of faceless (if entertaining) internet fairies with impeccable foul language.

But yesterday I boarded a plane bound for home with a new friend from thousands of miles away and it made me understand that there are 6 (wait, now 7 holy shit) MILLION living, breathing people with names, faces, and stories out there. We're all doing something important together.

It was really significant moment for me - and I’d be stoked if there was a way I could help more of us experience it.

Why This Weekend Is So Crucial...

Ok listen up retards... I know it's Friday and some of you short-term monkey brains are thinking about bailing on your brothers. Your paper hands are beginning to cramp up. I get it. **BUT WE CANNOT SELL!**  


There are still **MASSIVE** amounts of shorts on $GME. Still well over 113% of total shares floated (*from S3 Partners*). Some old shorts have gotten out, but many **NEW** shorts have taken their place in the past couple of days hoping that $GME will die out.  


# Here is the key part...

They are literally PRAYING for us to sell our shares and end this entire thing today. They are HOPING that they can make back their money at our expense... **BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT THEY HOLD THEIR SHORT POSITIONS IS COSTING THEM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY!!!**  


# BILLIONS A DAY.

All we need to do is **HOLD**. That's it. We will cost them so much money today, next Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and on and on. Soon enough they won't be able to pay the cost of their shorts or it just won't be worth the cost anymore and they will all eventually have to bail. **THAT IS GOING TO BE THE SQUEEZE**. Once the costs keep adding up, they will start to bail and the rest will follow.  


WE MUST STAY STRONG. DON’T FORGET WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO US. IT'S A GAME OF CHICKEN. WHOEVER BLINKS FIRST.. LOSES.  
We're not fucking blinking.  


**TL/DR: HOLD. HOLD. HOLD. THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK IS CRUCIAL!**

But there are 89,000 call options expiring friday from $60-$120 that MMs will have to hedge as the price increase. Shorts are going to do anything they can to keep it down below that to save themselves.

There are another 60,000 puts that are expiring today that market makers will have to unhedge as the price rises, also contributing to a gamma squeeze.

There are another 90k calls from $120 to $800 that are almost completely unhedged, but I'm also not expecting us to pump all the way up to the 800s to squeeze those so i've excluded them from the main numbers.

These are personal opinions/my guesses and not investment advice. I've also got so much GME that I can't do anything but stare at this stupid chart all day.


**TL;DR:** In total that's 15,000,000 million shares they'd have to buy today of which they've only hedged about 3 million so far (rough estimate based on eyeballing the delta). That's a whole lot of squeeze if we can find the juice. 

***Next day edit:*** You can see from the price action and high volume 10 minutes before close that bulls were trying to drive the price as high as they can while shorts were trying to keep it below $60. At $64 bulls had a small win leaving all the 60p to expire worthless. I'm slightly bullish coming into next week, but looking to see when it closes above the 4 day SMA to really say momentum is returning.

**Anatomy Of A Short Attack**

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

-----------------------------------

**Typical tactics include the following:**


**Flooding the offer side of the board**

Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. **They will do what has been called a short down ladder.** It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

**By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral.** If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.

Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

-----------------------------------

**Media Assault**

**The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.**

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.

One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube.

-----------------------------------

**Pulling margin from long customers**

**The clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability, citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy. This causes a flood of margin selling, which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover.**

-----------------------------------

**Paid bashers**

The shorts will hire paid bashers who ""invade"" the message boards of the company. The bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation. (Click here for Confessions Of A Paid Stock Basher).

This is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock. Almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics.

-----------------------------------

**Analyst Reports**

Some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports. The reports, which were represented as being independent, were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack. There is congressional testimony in the matter of Gradiant Analytic and Rocker Partners that expands upon this. These libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned ""friendly"" media. All were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation.

-----------------------------------

**Planting moles in target companies**

The shorts plant ""moles"" inside target companies. The moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors. They steal confidential information, which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media. The information may not be true, may be out of context, or the stolen documents may be altered. Things that are supposed to be confidential, like SEC preliminary inquiries, end up as front-page news with the short-friendly media.

-----------------------------------

**Frivolous SEC investigations**

The shorts ""leak"" tips to the SEC about ""corporate malfeasance"" by the target company. The SEC, which can take months processing Freedom of Information Act requests, swoops in as the supposed ""confidential inquiry"" is leaked to the short media.

The plethora of corporate rules means the SEC may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings. Occasionally they do uncover an Enron, but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twenty-five percent. The announcement of no or little findings comes months later, but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible. The San Francisco office of the SEC appears to be particularly close to the short community.

-----------------------------------

**Class Action lawsuits**

Based upon leaked stories of SEC investigations or other media exposes, a handful of law firms immediately file class-action shareholder suits. Milberg Weiss, before they were disbanded as a result of a Justice Department investigation, could be counted on to file a class-action suit against a company that was under short attack. Allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media, again causing panic among small investors.

-----------------------------------

**Interfering with target company's customers, financings, etc.**

If the shorts became aware of clients, customers or financings that the target company was working on, they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction. Allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a company's product.

697,Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.,2021-02-01 22:24:28,"Ok, girls, I have an explanation why short interest is reported to have fallen when in fact it has not. Its not data faking, its hedge funds hedging their shorts with calls and puts. Let me explain.

Gary Black is a guy to follow. Not always follow his advice or take everything for granted, but he gives a good insight into how hedge funds think: https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1356253412103512065

Gary has the opinion, that short sellers have hedged their short position by buying ATM calls and selling ATM puts that match the share count of its short. Ok, so lets run through this scenario:

1. Before expiration, the fund doesnt do anything, he has to pay the daily fee of the short interest on his shares and he loses value on his call as well as gains value on his put (because he sold it). This can draw out the short squeeze by month!
2. At expiration, if the share price is above purchase price, he can exercise the call, return the shares and the put expires worthless so he keeps the premium.
3. If the share price goes down, the call expires worthless but he buys shares with the put and returns these shares to close his short position.

In scenario 1, the short interest stays the same as nothing happens. But I can totally see the statistics to **reduce the reported short position because it is fully hedged!** In scenario 2, the call seller has to find the shares on the market. In scenario 3 its the same, but this time the put buyer has to find the shares.

**IN ALL 3 SCENARIOS, THE SHORT INTEREST STAYS THE SAME BUT THE REPORTED SHORT INTEREST GOES DOWN BECAUSE ITS SHOVED UNDER THE RUG OF THE OPTIONS TRADERS.**

Which means, the statistics might be correct, but the true short interest is still the same as before! **THE SHORTS ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK!**

No investment advice you monkeys! We have the shorts by the balls until they turn blue and fall off!

738,Really long DD and Analysis! What happened yesterday explained in detail and exposing the HFs obvious manipulation.,2021-02-26 11:12:30,"Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!

&amp;#x200B;

First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**

&amp;#x200B;

**9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.

https://preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4

**9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that

https://preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22

**1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)

https://preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572

**2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.

https://preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31

**3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.

https://preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787

NOW THE ANALYSIS:

**WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**

So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.

**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**

Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.

https://preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb

**WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**

Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.

https://preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b

**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**

Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.

IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**

https://preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).

Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

**Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I keep trying to look for more Data and update this post! If I made some mistakes or missed something, feel free to tell me so I can keep you all up to date!"

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting ""real DD"" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling ""MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS""

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) ""$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE"" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&amp;#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on ""overall strength""
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST ""SENTIMENT"" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&amp;#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.

&amp;#x200B;

*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**

**You likely will not time the top. Pick a place you're ready to exit the trade, exit the trade or slowly shave your position, close the graphs and don't fomo back in. Just be done with the trade afterwards. You're likely not a cannabis multi millionaire and will not be one, unless you were loaded to the brim with low cost calls from last summer/fall or unless you literally yolo'd $10M into one of these a few weeks ago, and in that case, you belong here, congrats on your gains and fuck you.**

**THIS IS A SECTOR/FOMO SQUEEZE. AND IT WILL END. THIS IS NOT SENTIMENT AND CNBC IS TROLLING US WITH IT LIKE WE HAVE THE POWER.**

And if you think *WE* are the ones driving the price up, the hedge funds are definitely watching and playing and they can bring these down at will at almost any time they want. You're holding a lit molotov, the only question is: will you throw it before it blows up?

The rest of you? Plz fuck off with you 20 shares @ $2 on Sundial, fuck off with the ""HOLD THE LINE SNDL $10 EOW"", fuck off with your fomo, and **fuck off with the ""movement"" and ""lets push this to the sky"" stuff and most importantly don't post DD if you have zero clue what is going on.**

***You know what ""lets push this to the sky"" sounds like? Market manipulation.*** We're not in this together, I literally handed one of you a bag to hold this morning and even if they go up for another month, eventually, that bags gonna be heavy and I ain't coming back for it. I ain't tipping you either.

**These prices are insanely high for these companies. The multiples are out of control, and if you buy in at these levels, well, best of luck, I hope it works out for you. I'm fighting the fomo of extended gains, and will continue to put my money elsewhere.**

# SIR, THIS IS A CASINO.

Positions: I had the meme stocks like you literally all of them minus ACB and CGC. I took gains and bought 500 shares of Cresco prob increasing to 1,000 tomorrow, and kept the rest off the table to pay my wife's boyfriend's rent.

Disclaimer: I have Tilray puts I'm prepared to average down on and diamond hand like a real boss because this is coming back down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** You know what I forgot to add? Some of the biggest holders, the cannabis ETFs and funds, you know what they did today? They trimmed their positions. And they will continue to do so because of fiduciary responsibility and when you de-concentrate shares into the retail's hands, the moves will get more and more finnicky and more and more violent.

**Edit 2:** Some normie tried calling me out like I never saw this trade coming or am a hedge shill, [https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC](https://imgur.com/a/asAVkiC) \- I had thousands of shares, these are just the trades from this month, and I'm not advocating a buy, I sold mostly all of them this morning except for adding Cresco back in. You want the gain numbers? You do the math, I'm not your math tutor, I sold like 6 minutes after open for most of them. I have Tilray puts for next week and will be buying a few months out at various strikes as it continues to climb.

*Yeah, I think these are coming back down in price sooner rather than later, that isn't extraordinary information for a common sense person.*

**Edit 3: I'm getting piles of messages from people who used to follow my DD back in 2018/2019. Yes, it's the real SoRefreshing, proof:** [**https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe**](https://imgur.com/a/Pn5LqCe)

Edit 4: Eh don't request me with ""What should I do with XX"" be a big adult grown up and decide your own risk tolerance and exits. I responded to the first 10 or so. Now I have 100. I can't. I disabled chat messages.

Edit 5: jesus with the awards go buy TSLA calls this is WSB not fb/twtr disclaimer: have TSLA calls

Edit 6: Oh look, they're pinning it around the $42 strike. Go figure."
742,Ready To See Hedgefund CEOs Cry On CNBC Tomorrow?,2021-02-24 22:12:25,"It happened before, it will happen again. Get your cameras ready.

I am not a financial advisor. But I am funny."
743,"A word of caution from me, the guy who made $4million on GME... and yes, I'm still holding a lot. ✋💎🤚",2021-02-19 23:11:16,"You might know me from some of my GME posts several weeks ago, or from my Planet Money interview. I've been pretty quite the last few weeks and I have a reason why.  


First to answer some well asked questions.

I only played shares.   
I rolled several of my shares on peaks from Dec-Jan  
Yes I made $4million and I'm still holding a lot of shares  


Now to what I really wanted to state to new WSB members and old members like myself.  


!!!A word of caution!!!  
Several people, people pretending to be normal WSB members and then after a few reddit messages informing me they have been in finance for 25 years (going as far as creating new accounts to try and talk to me) Others who have been trying to identify me on Reddit, and asking for me to either email them or call them, and even meet up. Dont engage these people

MY message to these people. Do you think I'm stupid? Anonymity is my friend at this point. We all have seen what happens to users like DFV once you get a name and a face.  Stop trying to threaten people or identify then for money.


Yes I made money. Deal with it. No need to try and scare and threaten someone on the internet.
No one in my life other than my wife knows about the money anyway.


Stay safe kids, the internet is a big place. Don’t give out too much details about yourself. Remember, people can have the ability to see your post history on other subreddits if you dont disable it.

Finally:
BRO, I just like the stock

I'M STILL HOLDING, and ITM.✋💎💎💎🤚   my opinion is that GME is a 🚀 waiting to lift off again.



Edit: I went quiet a few weeks ago because of some of the crazy shit people said to me. You name it, it was said. Scams, help me, i’ll find you and kill you. I’ve never had that attention before. Plus with the DFV legal issues. Yes I also updated my messages so it doesn’t happen again. 

Stay safe kids, people are shockingly crazy."
744,I want to talk about u/DeepFuckingValue,2021-01-30 22:58:41,"I have watched every minute of DeepFuckingValue's youtube channel Roaring Kitty. 

When I found the channel I expected to find a total degenerate. I expected to see some tool sort of like u/WSBGod but with lucky real gains. I was super wrong.

What I found was an extremely smart, soft spoken, humble, and graceful individual.

He found true deep value in a stock and bet on it in a big way. Over the past several months he was welcoming people to challenge him. He was welcoming people to poke holes in his thesis. As GME grew and grew he meme-ed but never gloated. 

This GME situation has now exploded into something that no one (not even DFV) could have foreseen. I can't imagine what is going on for him and his family right now. 

He has been living in a rented house and now he is a multi-millionaire. People here see him as a deity. Some people here are demanding he speak. Hedge funds probably want to see him ridiculously prosecuted somehow for his DD posts. Some people here are demanding that he announce his next play. I have even seen some people here make serious suggestion that he get into politics. 

I think everyone needs to have mad respect for this guy. With that respect we should all understand that what he decides he wants next for himself might not be what some of us envision. 

The world is honestly his oyster right now and he could go in any direction. Maybe he doesnt want to be in the public eye and wants to be left alone. Maybe he wants to be the next Burry with his own Scion Capital. Maybe he just wants things to stay the same as possible and just do youtube videos from his likely soon to be not rented basement. Whatever his choice is this entire community and the world in general needs to respect it. 

I also see people here writing ""If he is holding. I am holding."" This is fine but people need to understand that he likely will not tell us when he is selling (he shouldn't tell us for MANY reasons). In addition, we need to respect that he IS ALLOWED to sell if he decides to do so.

GME for many has become a venue to personally fuck the system down to your last dollar, but it may not be the same way for him. I personally am holding my position to the bitter end for that reason, but he may not. Others may not. DVF is at the core a true value investor. You will learn this if you watch his videos. Value investors typically do not buy and hold stocks forever. I am very interested to see how this ends for him. We all need to respect what one another does with their money. 

From the early days of this forum there have been some major wins that were phony as fuck. Nothing about DFV is phony. He is completely genuine. He is the real Wall Street Bets God.

His name is u/DeepFuckingValue. Let's put respect on that name for what he has done and continue to respect it when he decides how to end it. 

TLDR: In watching hours of DFV content there is no way that you cannot like this guy. He is very smart and very humble. We need to support him should he want privacy. We need to respect him should he exit his position."

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair.

751,Mango Juul Pods are Back!,2021-02-05 13:01:24,"   Ok but not really but once again, our community held together and endured the face of corruption.  Corporate juggernauts marginalized us, rampant profiteers sought forth to influence us in hopes to acquire us. The community rallied to support /u/zjz to defend us but circumstances aren't aligned at this time for him to fulfill his duty. He is not a martyr but one of many guardians that oversee now almost 9 million of you. People talk like his bots are what's important. Truth is that it is how much of his life he dedicates to this thankless task that makes him an asset.  How he spends the time getting to know as many of you on a personal level lets you know this sub isn't run by robots but people.   

A repeat of history haunted us recently. Some of the mods took risks to make a stand against a repeat. I stood with them because our resolve is unwavering in protecting the integrity of the community. Our moderators are the biggest obstacle for those wanting to take advantage but this story isn't about us moderators. This is another story about you.  We are here for the community, not the other way around. The ones who didn't understand are finally gone. Those of us who remain are left to repair the tarnished culture of moderators past. While temptation became a challenge for them, there is no denying their past contributions. We wish them the very best.

&amp;#x200B;

  There have been many opportunists popping up everywhere pretending they /r/wallstreetbets. From fake merch to fake discords, fake social media accounts, and subreddits. If it's not linked here, it does not officially represent the subreddit.  They say that imitation is a form of flattery. Clout chasing is for clowns.     

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So how are things different?  We hope to change the way we do things internally, getting rid of secretive groups within the ranks and commit to open communication where there was none previously. The mistrust lingers heavily but I'm confident that our goals are aligned and hope this will the basis in which we will heal any wounds.  Any differences will be worked out, not just set aside so that we may remain one cohesive unit in support of the largest community of traders, investors of all ages, and experience. When we help each other, support one another we can all persevere through anything. That how we win.  Winners give off an aura that fuels phenomenal growth in our community as well as our wallets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

  This is your story to tell. Don't let them tell it for you.

&amp;#x200B;

On behalf of the mod team.

755,"Open letter to the brokers, just close the short positions.",2021-01-31 15:48:18,"The shorts will go bankrupt and you are next in line.

This is a game of chicken where reality tips greatly in our favor.

1. It costs absolutely nothing for us longs to hold onto our positions. Guess who has to pay to hold onto their positions?

2. Shorts can only try to shake us but the more they pressure us, the more our hands get encrusted in diamonds. Shorts can keep trying tricks but we have our own whales to see through them, meaning every dip is a discount and eventually, we will shake off all paper hands.

3. This collective will attain diamond hands. It is a matter of when not if. You have people who have nothing left to lose, betting everything they have on a chance to change their lives. You have people who are here just to make a point. You have degenerate gamblers who flip the finger to risk management. You have people who are just here for entertainment. These people are willing to see their money drop to 0 and this crowd is going international.

The only way out of this situation is to unwind the short interest and better now than later. If the shorts go bankrupt, as a broker, you are on the hook. Better close those short positions while the losses are limited to the shorts. Maybe you're enjoying the interest from loaning our shares out but the goal is to bust the shorts and we don't mind you being collateral damage (especially those specific few of you, you know who you are).

793,GME holders are basically in the best situation. Hear me out.,2021-02-02 20:53:33,"Think about it. All that's left are diamond handers. There's essentially no point in selling for *anyone* still holding as the upside is likely far greater than the downside as a result of losing so much money already. Paperhands are out of the way and would have sold long ago so there's less need to worry about existing GME holders selling (more confidence). Assuming WSB continues to hold/buy and is prepared for weeks to months of holding/buying, theoretically, this stock will catapult upwards. Worst case scenario is the hedge funds decide to cover sooner. In that case, there's a good shot of making back your money/profiting. Best case scenario, they refuse to cover, the stock slowly goes to the moon, and we're back in tumultuous short squeeze scenario, again, but this time everyone has moved to a broker that isn't pure trash. There's still around 55 percent of float shorted and I suspect it'll increase.

And here's the kicker:

Once the stock starts to rise, however long that takes, guess what's going to happen? All the paperhanded folk are going to jump right back in, or at least a lot of them. Guess what else? All those paperhanded folk likely made quite a bit of money on the way up the first time, therefore, more capital. GUESS WHAT ELSE ELSE? This just essentially means you can theoretically make even MORE MONEY by lowering your cost basis. GUESS WHAT WHAT ELSE ELSE ELSE? Uh, nothing, that's it.

801,Why GME dipped yesterday and why Holding the line matters more than ever.,2021-01-29 12:35:34,"Hello dear autists (and some new joiners who are about to hop on the train),

This is an unprecedented moment in Financial history. The establishment is balls deep in each others' arses and we saw that in the Citadel-Robinhood-Point72-StevenCohen collusion yesterday.

For those who missed what happened: Robinhood and other brokerage platforms coordinated a short attack on the retail investor by blocking buy orders and allowing only sell orders. This resulted in a near evaporation of buying volume and panic selling from a lot of understandably concerned stock holders.

It can be construed that this was happening on the orders of the great Citadel, who may have profited off opening short positions at the top. This was seen and caught by multiple order flow traders who noticed block trades. 

*A short ladder*

A short ladder was initiated. They closed the gates to retail and then block sold orders in the open market to drive down the prices. They did this between hedge funds A, B and C to maintain positions while profiting off their short positions (initiated at ATH). This can also be cross checked by looking at yesterday's volume, which was truly minimal. These HFs engineered the short ladder to use the low price to cover their short positions for cheap. Yet, the short interest dipped only marginally (from 140 percent to 120 percent) 

The idea was to have retail offload as many shares as possible to increase float, which will make covering the short positions easy. So now we know that this is what they want. They want us to sell. And they will try a variety of tricks to make us sell. The short ladder was one of those. 

So what can we do? And how will it matter? 

We do the opposite of what they want us to. We don't sell. How will this help the short squeeze? 

Not selling (and letting the buyers pile in) will add to the buying pressure. It will also reduce float. 

So when the shorts do choose to cover, they will need to buy again, and again, and again to cover their entire position.

So hear me out here let's do some quick math. Short interest (no of shares shorted/ no of available in float) = 120 percent. There are more shares shorted than exist to be bought. 

Investors like Burry and Cohen further reduce this float by piling in. In reality, the short is a good multiple of the float (this is my hunch). We have caught them by the balls and have a chance of changing the status quo. 

All you have to do is Hold and not increase the share float. Shorting Gamestop is becoming more expensive by the minute. The shorters need to pay their brokers margin to borrow shares too. By reducing float, we can make these HFs bleed more. 

By holding the line, we make HFs taste blood.

808,Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,2021-02-10 04:20:57,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

Edit 2: A [compelling theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lglkwv/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/gmsll2k/) put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read

821,GameStop/Ryan Cohen have not used their offering yet 🚀🚀🚀,2021-02-01 21:41:44,"This should tell you guys something. They had multiple chances to cash in at 300+ and even today, after a bleeding red day which looked like all momentum was killed, they have yet to cash in their offering they set in place during their Q4 report.

It’s not ideal to bank on unknown news but why wouldn’t GameStop board cash out at 300? 

Cause they too believe in the squeeze and probably know something. No company’s financial team/risk management team would just sit by and not take advantage of this opportunity unless they know somethings up. The fact that they have been quiet means something is coming. Something unthinkable. The god damn MOASS.

I hope Melvin and Citadel go to jail for their manipulation. I literally cannot fathom how they will get out of this one.

To the moon my brothers 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: clearly few people know the difference between an offering and insiders selling shares. GME filed a shelf offering back in December after their Q4 report to sell $100,000,000 worth of shares that are not outstanding. It’s not shares but a monetary value. Also a shelf offering basically has most of the legal and reg work done and they can enact it basically when they want (maybe not immediately but essentially everything would be ready set to announce an offering)

But then this shouldn’t make a difference, right?

Theoretically. Yes, they aren’t pressured to enact their offering at these prices since they would raise the same amount of capital regardless of the stock price. But by gaining the capital at these higher prices, you are diluting less of the company’s outstanding shares, thus, retaining more ownership over the company for current share owners. It would be beneficial to raise capital at these higher prices for that reason. Of course, the company also has to consider social sentiment and if it would ruin their potential new consumer audience.

Also the amount of posts I see about people saying they have upcoming quarterly earnings are ridiculous. GME reports quarterly earnings 1 month-2 months after most earnings (GME is not on the typical earnings schedule). We reported Q3 in December.... we are projected to release Q4 2020 in early April. Please do your own DD or you will fail to understand the underlying thesis and get burned

Basically, GME long but don’t be retarded and not take profits as we moon past 1,000 toward 100,000. Obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀"
822,"Success does not happen overnight - to those of you who hopped in with lambos in your eyes and dreams of 1000% gains overnight, I'm sorry to disappoint you, this fight is likely to go on for weeks.",2021-02-01 18:18:38,"There has been an influx of misinformation on all online forums. On WeBull, I see commenters seeing short squeezes going on EVERYWHERE - including stocks with under 20% short interest. We have here an influx of retail investors. Many of them have never had a penny in the stock market before. Many of them don't understand the situation beyond what the price reflects at the moment and think that every dip is a short ladder...what's worse, many of them are vulnerable to emotional trades, having put in more than they can afford to lose but without the conditioning many traders develop after years of seeing the ups and downs.

Not everything is a short squeeze.

Not everything is a conspiracy theory (although the recent $SLV situation given Citadel's positions is very suspect - infer what you will)

There is no set date for the squeeze - There is NO set date for shorts to have to cover unless market conditions force them to.

The only way to win this, is to hold. Turn your share lending off if your broker allows. Ride the ups and the downs. Set you limit sell much higher than the market value - this will influence the price.

Most importantly, understand: a true short squeeze will happen if shorts are FORCED to cover their positions at whatever the current price is. This is not the same as contract expiry - they are two different things.

Short sellers have likely been covering as much as they can on every dip, to cover themselves. This is because shares are still being traded.

Don't sell. We need to limit the supply. If you're in over your head, take a deep breath and do what is best for you, we'll take the burden off your hands. It will take time, but once the shares are in 💎🤲💎 we'll win.

Listen.

Fidelity and Vanguard are in a class of their own when it comes to retail brokers available to retail investors. Shithood, Interactive Dumbasses and so on do NOT compare. 

Shithood is a little startup that has to answer to hedge funds, HFTs (their main customers of order flow buys), and venture capitalists. Shithood CEO has no fucking idea what he's doing and is clearly vested in our failure.

## **Fidelity and Vanguard** 🚀🚀✅

Here come the big fucking boys!

Fidelity has **$3.3 trillion**, YES trillion, in assets under management. Vanguard has **$8.8 trillion** in assets under management. I am saying TRILLIONS, not little billions.

Guess what? **THEY ANSWER TO NO FUCKING ONE**.

## **Fidelity owns 13.67% of GME shares.** 💸💸💸

And Vanguard? 6.27% of GME shares.

825,"How GME IS going to the moon(Yes, it's still possible) (Crucial pls read)",2021-02-02 16:39:33,"Obligatory:
First, non of this is financial advise&amp;I'm not a financial advisor
Secondly, I'm not sure if this fits in DD since this is more psychology so mods please correct the flair if I'm using the wrong one.

That being said:
I know y'all retarded apes don't want to read, but bear with me here. 
The current fact we all first need to acknowledge is that the price of GME has dropped significantly, and that the volume, albeit still low, is higher than yesterday to say the least. People have started to sell, and other where on Reddit people are starting to belief this thing is all over and we're a bunch of cultists.
Now the question I know y'all want to know: Is it over yet?
Short answer:Likely not, but it depends on us.
The very basis of the reason many of us believe GME with go to the moon in the first place, that it is HEAVILY shorted, *still holds true*. According to the volumes for the last few days, the restrictions still going on, and the media fake-silver hype, the HFs likely haven't covered their positions yet. Many of them likely even added new ones, as they believe the price is going to fall. The potential for going to the moon is always there, it never changed. What has changed, and can potentially truly wreck this spaceship, is our mentality. Due to the price drop, which, started with the HFs with their dirty tricks, people are starting to panic, and this panic, which is caused by a false manipulation, CAN wreck GME. People are less likely to buy in as they're afraid this is not ending well, and people are more inclined to sell due to the dropping and seeing all the other people selling.
*Spamming 💎🙌💎🙌💎🙌 will NOT stop people from selling or panicking. It only serves to make them think we're a cult*

*What to do*
What is important as of now, whether you're still in, already sold, or has been speculating the whole time thinking this is over and all these poor cultists are going to end up in shit. Is to understand, and not just blindly belief, that *the stock is still heavily shorted, and this fact NEVER changed*. If we all understand this fact we *win*. The only potential source of this failing is our doubt amongst ourselves. I urge everyone to take a deep breath, and ask yourself: *Do you really belief that the HFs are truly out?* If the answer is no, than the best thing we can do is to recollect ourselves, regain the faith(which should not be blind faith but faith backed by reason) we had in each other and in this stonk, and HOLD AND BUY. 

TLDR
*Our whole reason of doubt is our own doubt. The entire thing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we all believe we win we win, if we all believe we lose we lose.(Yes this includes you bystander, we are all in this together) The fundamental reason the we believed GME is going to the moon has NEVER changed. HAVE FAITH that is BASED ON REASON. Blind belief is NOT solid, and can only get you so far*.
The stock is at a low, and this is a great opportunity if you sold earlier to get back in again. If we come together and have faith in reason, we have a greater chance than EVER to send this to the moon, wreck Wall Street, whatever you're in this for at the beginning.
*Unity and belief in reason, not fear, makes us strong*
*GME TO THE MOON BUY AND HOLD*

To rebuild faith in reason: 
-Welcome discourse, don't call everyone a bot
-Actively engage in discussions and focus on the fact that the stock is still heavily shorted as ever
-Spam less emojis, more rational discourse, appear more collected so people don't think we're a bunch of crazy cults sinking with the ship"

FAQs since y’all ask the same god damn questions 
- Why exercise instead of sell the contracts and just buy the shares? Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes. 
- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. 
- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it’s my biggest holding. It’s the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world’s most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I’m buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

828,Addressing Misinformation and Bad Advice as I see it,2021-02-02 21:32:58,"I’m just gonna come out straight and say it: you are hurting yourself more than helping when you spread information that is ignorant and not based in reality.

Last Thursday and Friday, there was all of this talk of a Gamma Squeeze, “it’s going to happen, oh yeah definitely so long as we close above the magic and imaginary number of $320. Don’t worry, shorts won’t cover until Tuesday so you can be patient, wait it out”

Every fucking time you degenerates give a deadline, you create another opportunity for disappointment. Stop it. No one knows what’s going to happen or when. 

Yes, monkeys strong together, but also monkeys stupid together. It’s a fine sentiment. The culture stuff is less so.

Is this subreddit really going to turn into such a dumbass fucking echo chamber that every single time the stock goes down we scream “short ladder!” “Market manipulation!” “Fake news!”

Because while all of these things are possible, it’s also a FUCKING VOLATILE MARKET. And every single time someone says that something in it is guaranteed, they’re setting themselves up for failure.

So yeah, FUCKING hold, obviously. But don’t gamble away your life savings.

Obviously but the dip. But ask yourself where you genuinely want and believe the stock you’re investing in to be.

Also. “Shorts have x days to cover, it’ll go up then!!”
And “GME is now on the short restriction list!! That means that we literally can’t lose now” are fucking stupid. Not based in reality. Look, we all want our tendies. We all want them to be guaranteed. But this is a war of attrition.

And there’s no such thing as guaranteed success.

If you like the stock, buy it.  If you think, based on a whim, or research, or for any fucking reason that convinces you that a stock is going to go up, then buy the stock. Look at DFV: He didn’t invest because he thought a massive short squeeze was going to drive his value investment into the 8 or 9 digits, and he didn’t sell when he was at almost 50mil- you know why?

Because he believes in the fucking company and isn’t here to get a quick buck.

Buy low. Sell high. Fomo is fucking stupid. 

And make your own god damned decision.

835,Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required.,2021-02-13 18:09:04,"Alright apes and autists, let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze. If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.

On November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled ""Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers"". In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.

**The Mission Statement**

""GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \[...\] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services.""

**The Landscape**

* Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry
   * ""The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.""
   * ""The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023.""
* Valuable Assets
   * Existing ""strong brand"" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.
   * ""Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.""
   * Large retail and physical footprint.

**The Roadmap**

* Evolve into a Technology-first company
   * ""Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another.""
   * GameStop will have to ""begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers."" (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)
   * GameStop will have to ""hire the right talent."" (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).
* Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform
   * ""Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors."" (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)
   * Provide and expand ""larger gaming catalogs"" (Capture all games)
   * Create ""community experiences"" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)
   * Provide ""streaming services"" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)
   * Support ""Esports"" (Expanding scene that is not going away)
* Transition to Digital
   * ""Industry developments in recent years"" include ""transition from physical hardware to digital streaming"" and the ""explosion of mobile.""
   * Expand ""digital content."" (This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)
   * Allow ""online trade-ins."" (This would be a game changer)
* Cut Excessive costs
   * ""Cut its excessive real estate costs"" and ""identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.""
   * Streamline ""Non-core operations in Europe and Australia \[...\] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash.""
   * ""Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future.""

**The Financials**

Analysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:

* GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.

Note this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.

**The X Factor**

I believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that ""RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability."" With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.

Notice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon’s customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.

Furthermore, I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.

So degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.

P.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.

**TLDR; Ryan Cohen is Jesus. Buy and Hold $GME.**"

837,To Ape Gang: Why Sentiment Has Turned Against You,2021-02-08 06:49:01,"I want you to understand this.  Truly.

I like GameStop.  I like $GME.  I believe in the long term plan (or what I/we think is the plan, anyway).  I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded.  I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March.

I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY.  I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company.  I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case, which they barely even pretend to have considered.  I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck.

My personal belief, which I require nobody else to share, is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do, and their buying alone will drive the price up.  But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price, or they'd have done so.  I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value.  And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares.  That's what I believe, and why I'm not holding positions right now.  I probably will in the future, but my personal opinion is the time is not right.

But you guys are actually fucking insane.  We dont have a problem with the stock.  We have a problem with YOU.

Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing.  And that's okay!  But the new people (7 million new versus 1.5 million old) have done the following:

* Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME, AMC, BB, and NOK
   * Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK
   * Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots
      * While you've realized there were bots that were bought, you missed (probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas) that the bots were spamming NOK.
   * Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next
* Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier.
   * I saw one person disagreeing with a long-time and well-respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post, and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position.
* Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist
   * Short ladders?  Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder?  EVERY TIME?
   * You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply &amp; demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days?
* With zero understanding of market mechanics, explaining to others why price action is fake
   * ""Look how low volume is on this candle!  It's not a real drop!""
   * [the dip is fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay22q/the_dip_is_fake_look_at_how_many_people_are/)
* Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 ""paperhand pussies"" for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1,500%
* Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum
* Denying Reality
   * S3 partners is not lying to you.  They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult-to-obtain information on short interest.  Just because they're reporting that short % of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you.
* Spammed low-effort memes and easily-Googleable questions on the new submissions
   * When your posts were taken down, you posted AGAIN
* Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot
* AGGRESSIVELY spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position
* I want to gag every time I see somebody write ""I'm not a financial advisor"" following a post that makes that very clear
* Moving the goalposts
   * ""YOU ARE HERE on the VW short squeeze graph!""
   * ""We finished above $325!  Gamma squeeze!"" (Personal confession, I almost fell for this one and I'm glad I sold before the plummet).
   * ""Ok so there was no gamma squeeze Monday but Tuesday is the day!""
   * ""Ok we fell another 50% Tuesday but definitely Wednesday!""
   * ""Fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us!""
* Accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done, which is remove shit-tier posts from the front page
   * which you then posted again
      * and again
* Completely ignored the rules of our subreddit
   * Market Manipulation --
   * No Pump &amp; Dumps -- pressuring other people to buy low float stocks (such as GME) so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam.
   * Political Bullshit -- If you think ""it's not about the money"" then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money.
   * No Bullshitting -- There are so many of you advising others on their trades (followed by ""This is not financial advice, am ape"") while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on Reddit 5 minutes ago, which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who DID know what they were talking about, but OP misinterpreted the meaning.
      * Believe it or not, that's against the rules.  Just say you dont know.  Or say nothing.  There's actually no need to spam.
* Gain &amp; Loss Posts - nobody wants to see your Loss on one-third of a share of AMC.  Come on.
* YOLO - Your investment in one-third of a share of AMC is not a YOLO.  A YOLO is DFV leveraging up his entire $55,000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die.
   * [not a fucking YOLO -- it's a picture of a billboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la96zj/my_amc_billboard_is_up_in_kalamazoo_mi/)
* Drowned out a lot of really good content on non-GME stuff
   * u/dhsmatt2 's [updated PRPL $1.1MM DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcgce1/1100000_purple_mattress_yolo_update/)

   * I can't even find the others that I had in mind using the search tool because the entire list of YOLO's and DD's is filled with GME and AMC karma farming.
* And you've now begun brigading WSB from r/GME.

You have formed a cult.  You've now decided, amongst yourselves, that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill.  Do you think that's a healthy mindset?

If this is the investment that you truly want to make, and you feel you have an understanding of the risks, then fucking ***let it rip.***  I hope it works out.  Seriously, I want you to make money.  I like Gain porn a lot more than Loss porn.

But stop bullshitting.  Stop brigading.  Stop spamming.

You're driving us nuts.

This is an extension of my DD series on GME. I have been investing in, learning about, and following GME since September 2020, and in that time I have learned many things. It is also likely my last post on GME for a while as I find myself repeating key points, and others are doing excellent DD on GME in the meantime.

In this post, I’ll share as much understanding as I can about how we got here, about shorts, and my thoughts on the future of GME. I’ll also try to include many tips around trading/investing with GME going forward. 

**TL;DR:** The squeeze has been reset. Shorts have re-set their short positions at much higher sell points, and longs have likely cycled through. I don’t believe a VW-style squeeze is possible because Robinhood will just get choked again, but I do believe $GME is worth much more than $50/share. Fuck “diamond handing”, I’m **starting to accumulate shares again.** I share below how I’m trading GME.

* [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) (DTC Infinity) covered the short positions, the float, and potential snowball impacts of increasing prices, and argued that part of the reason that shorts haven’t closed was that it was pretty much impossible for shorts to close 
* [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) covered Cohen, fair market cap analysis, and potential investors, in which I talked about the amazing mid-to-long term potential for GME.

# Important External Reading

These three non-reddit articles are critical for understanding the short playbook. This is essential reading if you want to understand how the funds that are short GME may have manipulated/directed the DTCC to strong-arm Robinhood to halt buying on the 28th. My key takeaway from all this is that the core investigation needs to be happening with the **DTCC/NSCC** to understand why the margin changes were forced upon RobinHood, and who specifically asked for the buying halt on the 28th. I believe shorts worked together with brokerages and the DTCC to rob investors of over $40B of value, representing what is probably one of **the greatest financial crimes of the century.**

   * “Who controls the DTCC? **The answer is that the banks and brokers who use DTCC‘s services, who process trades there, who fail to deliver there, are insiders who sit on the DTCC Board of Directors.”**

# History of shares and shorts on $GME

Here’s some history on GME that’s worth knowing so you understand the context of where we are today. 

* **GME used to have many, many more shares outstanding.** Back in 2009, there were over 160M shares outstanding, and GME has steadily been reducing the number of shares outstanding through buybacks and share retirements, concluding with a **massive share 40% buyback in 2019** pushing GME under 70M outstanding shares. 

&amp;#x200B;

[When you look at a price history chart, you need to factor this in. So when GME’s share price was $50 in 2008, its market cap was actually $8B not $4B like it is today at $50\/share. ](https://preview.redd.it/ejtu6zwpw2i61.png?width=970&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39251744113f8248a9b8290193d0df5e7436ae2a)

* **GME used to be in the S&amp;P 500.** It was added in December 2007 when it had around an $8B market cap and removed in April 2016 when its market cap had dropped to around $3B. In 2016, there were about 25M+ shares shorted of GME. **It’s very likely GME was shorted out of the S&amp;P.** 
* **Short interest did not decrease after share buybacks.** In 2019, GME bought back and retired 40% of their shares yet amazingly the short interest **increased**. How is it possible that shorted shares, **if not naked**, did not have to find new borrows to cover? How could they have found 30M borrows in such a short period? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/axl9ipwqw2i61.png?width=937&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd2743962405738469193d7e6c59d3068f1f8d78

* **How were shorts able to increase their short position by 20M shares in such a short period of time?** In July 2019 GME bought back and retired 10M shares. At the same time, shorts increased their short position by 20M shares. How is this possible? How could they have borrowed 20M more shares while shares are being retired and removed from float?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9fdeyrrw2i61.png?width=1030&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3efeb376b15e8574e98fa90622c79f1eadcd8772

* **Shorts did not close at $3 because of a tax loophole.** Shorts had been shorting GME since it was well over $40/share in 2015. By April 2020, GME had dropped to under $3, and shorts were sitting on **billions in profit.** Why not take profits? A little known **tax loophole** allows hedge funds to **pay no taxes** if a company they shorted goes bankrupt, as they do not need to close the trade, so the profit is not realized.  
* **Many of the major short funds are disciples of Steve Cohen, who previously paid billions to settle insider trading charges.** Maplelene capital, Melvin, others are all Steve Cohen cronies. Who bailed out Melvin? Steve Cohen. 
* **There are many strange connections between DTCC’s actions and shorts.** As you know DTCC/NSCC put a gun to Robinhood’s head demanding billions in liquidity to support their customers buying GME. At that point more than 50% of Robinhood’s users had GME. 
   * Robinhood is only worth around $10B. The amount being asked for from DTCC was likely to drive Robinhood into the ground had they not found a solution.
   * **Key question: Who suggested the buying halt? Was it Vlad? Or did the DTCC suggest a buying halt to as a negotiating tactic to reduce the liquidity requirements?** Sounds very much like a “turn off buying or else” kind of arrangement. 
   * Keep in mind, that at this point shorts were on the verge of losing **upwards of $50B** as **GME was well on its way over $500/share**. So Citadel doesn’t care about shooting down Robinhood. It’s a minor toe amputation to save their leg. 
   * The 4am call from the DTCC happened **2 days after Citadel and Point72 bailed out Melvin** and **1 day after the put:call ratio for GME flipped 3:1 for puts** \- not only was this coordinated, shorts knew this was coming and profited from it 
      * **If a regulator/lawmaker/SEC agent could figure out who bought those puts, you’d know something interesting.** 

# Why GME went up

* Many pundits in the media were extremely confused why the price of GME got so high. Let me try and explain this. 
   * First, the **current price of an equity is just the last traded price.** This is a very, very critical piece you need to understand. When there are 70M shares outstanding, and 1M shares get traded back and forth multiple times a day, the price you see is just the price of the active float trading back and forth. This is why many technical traders pay very close attention to **volume.** When there’s **high trading volume relative to total float**, it’s easier to believe the price is more reflective of actual underlying value. 
   * In the case of GME, **supply and demand** is the critical driver of price. As I mentioned in [EndGame Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) the true supply of GME shares (tradable float) is ridiculously low) 
   * The demand side comes in 4 parts: 
      * Value buyers - people like DFV who saw a company at $4 valued less than 1 year cashflow and decided to tell the world about how great of an opportunity this was
      * Squeeze buyers - people and funds that smelled blood in the water and bought shares in anticipation of someone else **needing** to pay more
      * Shorts covering - shorts that needed or wanted to buy as the trade went against them
      * MM hedging - repeated gamma squeezes that had an outsized impact on price due to the low underlying liquidity of GME 
   * For a normal equity, most of that demand side **does not exist.** Low supply + high demand = high price. That’s why GME shot up. 

# The Big Reset

This wasn’t just a squeeze, this was a massive reset on investors (long and short) for GME. 

* Any SEC filings (13G/13F) showing positions prior to Feb 1 are **irrelevant** (other than insider positions). It’s very likely many longs liquidated during the squeeze, and likely many shorts covered. Some of those longs that liquidated may re-invest, and some of the shorts that covered may re-short. 
* Shorts were given a huge bailout, whereas they previously were sitting on losses upwards of $50B they were instead able to close positions at much lower share prices, with GME currently sitting at $49/share - a 90% reduction from its peak of $500/share prior to the buying halt on the 28th. 

# However, this is not the end for GME

* Everything started with value on GME
   * At $50, we’re back to a value play. GME’s market cap is now under **$4B.** Remember that GME has over $1B in e-commerce revenue alone every year and e-commerce is growing at 300%. For more on market cap potential, go see [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/) or the excellent [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com/)
   * **Nothing that happened in the last few weeks has changed the core fundamentals of the business** or the **prospects for a Cohen-led revitalization**, so if you were in this for Cohen at $20-35, we’re not too far off from that right now. 
   * If people can afford to hold their shares, the float continues to shrink 
* Wild cards remain (in order of decreasing likelihood) 
   * **Cohen still needs to buy his 7%**. He’s likely waiting for a good signal from the board that he’s going to be CEO as well as a good entry point. The officers added to the company on the board also need to buy their shares. They are not buying in at squeeze entry points. 
      * **Key point:** When insiders buy shares, their shares are removed from the lending pool. **This is part of the GME corporate bylaws.** I believe this is likely what triggered squeeze 1.0, as that happened roughly 2 days after Cohen’s 9M shares were likely recalled when he got added to the board. 
   * **Regulatory involvement.** It’s really unlikely the SEC is going to step up and enforce their own fucking rules, but hey if they did we might see some reductions in fails-to-deliver and the blatant naked shorting happening with GME. 
   * **Share recalls for a vote**. There are a number of reasons this could happen. I think it’s unlikely but if this were to happen non-naked shorts would need to cover. 
   * **People moving out of Robinhood** to brokers that can stop lending their shares - After this shitshow, I moved a few thousand shares out of RH. I didn’t realize they were being lent out to shorts and Robinhood was pocketing the difference. 
      * You can only get Robinhood to stop lending your shares if you move to a cash account, but **interestingly Robinhood’s instructions for how to downgrade to a cash account have disappeared from their site.** ([Try clicking on “downgrade” under Robinhood Cash here](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/robinhood-accounts/)). **Shady AF.** 

# How I’m thinking about GME now 

This is going to sound extremely strange, but **I’ve never been more excited to lose money.** I am holding several thousand shares in GME, but my position is only about 25% of my desired position, and I can’t wait to buy GME at lower prices. I hadn’t bought any shares since $35 (see my part 2 when I said I went all in), and sold on the way up to take some profit, but I’m slowly starting to add again around $50 with the profits I made from trimming on the way up when it got above my price target I shared in part 2 of $125. 

None of this squeeze drama, broker drama, etc. changes the fundamentals of the company and why I was bullish in the first place. I think that the core short thesis of “GME is another blockbuster destined for death” is dumb and I think Cohen is going to cause a future re-rating of the company. 

Since part 2, some interesting developments have happened at GME, including the addition of new officers of the company (more Chewy execs and one ex-Amazon exec as the new Chief Technology Officer). 

I believe strongly that Cohen has a strong chance of becoming CEO. I don’t think they would have been able to add the talent recently had it not been for him, and the creation of a tech officer position is a clear signal that the thinking of how to run the company is changing. (Think about it - **if this was just blockbuster with a website why would they need a Chief Technology Officer?**) Big plans are afoot folks. **$4B for GME is cheap.** 

That being said, I’m hoping for a further dip. I’m **selling puts from 40 down to 10** hoping to score as many cheap shares as I can, and to take advantage of the still-insanely-high IV. 

# Suggestions 

This is going to be a long fight. It is painful for all of us, regardless of your cost of entry, because longs would have won the battle had the market remained free. Instead, funds, clearinghouses, brokers colluded to restrict buying and eliminate the demand side of the market. 

Here’s some thoughts on managing your GME positions going forward. 

* **Take advantage of IV while it is high.** While IV is still high, sell puts if you want to add, sell calls to reduce your cost basis. For example, I sold 2/26 9p for like $0.5 - **that’s a 6% return on capital in less than a month**, and either I own GME at $9 (awesome!) or I keep the premium (also good). I personally believe we will not be allowed to squeeze unless regulators step in and open up the market here, which will not happen quickly, if ever. So I’m selling calls against my remaining shares. 
   * I also sold some Nov 70p for \~$42. Let me explain this trade for those of you that don’t sell puts normally. Selling puts gets a bad wrap of “pennies in front of a steamroller” but this is **not the case with GME if you do it right.**
      * Someone paid me $4200 now for the requirement that I would be forced to buy 100 shares of GME at $70 in november (total of $7000). 
      * So I have to set aside $2800 of my own capital to secure this put. 
      * Two scenarios:
      * So, in my mind, this is a trade that “can’t go tits up”.
      * “Downside” risks:
* **Have your own price target:** Keep a valuation target in mind below which you believe it makes sense to add, and above which it makes sense to trim. If you are in need of some research here, see gmedd.com. I also wrote my own long-term bull targets in [EndGame Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0czgs/gme_endgame_part_2_cohen_market_cap_potential/). Buy low, not high folks - don’t fomo. 
* **Stop sharing your positions publicly.** I know this is anti-wsb, and I think sharing them is great for this community, but in the case of GME it’s an **attack vector** for you. 
* **Be careful of holding weeklies until expiration.** Remember the multiple trading halts? What if trading gets halted on Friday at 2pm and doesn’t resume for the rest of the day? **All your calls would expire worthless. Depending on your broker and your cash positions, maybe even your ITM ones.** Roll (or sell, if you’re taking profits) your weeklies well before expiration. 
* **Get the F out of Robinhood.** While Robinhood was just a pawn IMO, why do you want to use a broker that can F you so easily? They lend your shares to shorts and don’t pay you for it, margin call you when you’re winning, sell your shares at absolute lows, and pass all your data to Citadel. I don’t think the “free” commissions are really free. RH is worse for your financial future.
* **Minimize regret; don’t maximise profitability.** I sold some shares “early” on the way up to take out my cost basis and some profit. I missed all the peaks (never sold any shares above $400), but holding out for “maximum profit” led to a bit more regret when things went the wrong way.
* **Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose.** I’ve been in GME long enough to know that just when you think going up is a sure thing, you can be surprised by a new trick. If you bet it all on weeklies all at once, you may not be able to recover from being wrong on the timing. Consider longer expiry or spreading your purchases out. I’ve held through multiple 50%+ drawdowns in the underlying; you need to be ready for the volatility. 
* **Watch out for stop loss hunts.** It’s common practice for shorts to hunt for stop losses for cheap shares. If you’ve set a stop loss, be really sure about it. 
* **Don’t sell on dips.** You’re only helping the shorts. If you need to sell to take profits, sell when it’s heading up. Sell high, not low retards.
* **Save dry powder to buy on dips.** Dips manufactured by shorts are buying opportunities. Take advantage of folks with paper hands to capture shares at low points. GME has incredible daily volatility. Set a low limit buy and just wait for the order to fill. Have patience when buying.

This is not financial advice; do your own DD. I’m holding what previously was valued at over $1M in shares and calls. And I added 1500 shares these last 2 weeks as well as sold hundreds of puts to either capture six figures of premium or buy 7 figures worth of GME at price points I find attractive.

# Bonus: If I was Maxine Waters, what would I ask?

On February 18th, Congress will be interviewing Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel, and DFV. Here are some questions I’d love to see asked with the answers aired out in public, under oath. 

## Dear Vlad,

1) Have they ever had such a dramatic margin increase request from DTCC before?

2) How much time have previous requests been given to accomodate vs this one?

3) Who suggested the solution of restricting buying? Was it Robinhood or suggested by DTCC as a concession in return for a reduced margin requirement? What other solutions were explored and why were they not pursued?

4) To his knowledge, are there any historical professional or other relationships between the decision makers in the DTCC to the funds that are/were shorting GME

5) What is preventing this from happening again, should GME’s price rise again to $500/share or more? 

## Dear Kenny G,

1) Could you explain the reasons for your bailout of Melvin capital?

2) How many members of the DTCC are former Citadel employees?

3) Did you or anyone in Citadel communicate with the DTCC prior to their margin changes to robinhood. If so, what were the nature of these communications?

4) What positions did Citadel take against GME prior to the buying halt on the 28th?

5) Did Citadel share any of its order flow data with any hedge funds shorting GME

6) Did Citadel have any communications with Robinhood senior management in the weeks leading up to the 28th?

## Dear Plumpkin,

1) Please explain how shorts are able to short greater than the outstanding float of an equity

2) Short interest increased by 20M shares in July 2019. Did Melvin increase their short position in that timeframe? If so, please explain how you were able to borrow shares when 40% of GMEs float was bought back

3) Please explain the method by which hedge funds do not pay taxes when they have a short on a company that has gone bankrupt

4) Are any members of the DTCC former employees of Melvin Capital? If not, please share what communications between the DTCC and melvin capital the weeks leading up to the 28th

5) Did you have any agreements written or otherwise with other major shorts of GME. I e. Maplelene Capital

6) There were 6000 short term puts purchased within 30 minutes prior to Citron's tweet announcing their pending argument against gme. Did Melvin capital purchase any puts on that day in that time frame?

7) What was the arrangement between citron and melvin capital?

8) Have you ever paid for media placements against GME

9) Please explain why you could state that you have closed your short positions when your recent filings say otherwise

10) Did Melvin open short positions on X-""R""-T when they closed their short gme positions

11) Please explain your process to locate borrows for shorts. With whom in the DTCC do you cooperate with?

12) Has Melvin Capital ever been forced to  buy-to-close short positions as a result of Regulation SHO / fails to deliver?"

I'm a pretty smart ape and that's what I would do.

Notice how GME has been going against SPY lately? It might reverse to tank all together this week when they sell their long positions and short GME at the same time. But have no fear fellow apes. Just hold onto that bananananana and GME will eventually come back up.  In shorting even more they are incurring a much higher interest day after day.

I would just ignore the market this week and do something fun to relax until you hear about the squeeze has squoeze."

858,Addressing GME FUD &amp; current situation,2021-02-02 18:09:14,"Fellow Mashed Potato Brains,

First – Monke Diamond Hands Banana Rocket Rocket Rocket Rocket Moon

**This is not financial advice. This is speculation based on my limited understanding of SEC rules and documents. Sources linked. Please read edits.**

**TLDR**: **My opinion** is that Shorts will continue to drive the price down with ladders and try to break the chain of consecutive days where GME is listed as a threshold security. ~~They need at least 1 non-Failure To Deliver day before EoD Thursday.~~ **If** ~~they~~ **an individual short gets even 1 day without** **~~aggregate~~** **Failure To Deliver then the entire 13 consecutive day count restarts \*for that short.** ~~They~~ **The shorts as a whole need 5 consecutive days without aggregate Failure To Deliver to have GME fully removed as a threshold security. Selling is good for them and bad for diamond hands. Ape strong together. Diamond Hands get the Rocket Ship.** **No idea if achieving 13 consecutive days will force the squeeze or not.**

&amp;#x200B;

**My opinion** is that Shorts don’t plan to cover their position by Tuesday. They don’t have to. Instead, they will drive the price down for as many days as possible and attempt to break the chain of consecutive settlement (read: business) days where they fail to deliver. GME has been listed as a **threshold security** (see below) for ~~10~~   \*37 consecutive business days (please check my math. I had to count on my fingers). \*Individual Shorts (not the short collective as a whole) need to break their chain of failure to deliver on that threshold security before it reaches **13 consecutive business days**. “Participants of a registered clearing agency must immediately purchase shares to close out fails to deliver in ‘threshold securities’ if the fails to deliver persist for 13 consecutive settlement days.” \[SEC Rule 204\] (link below)

**If diamond handed monke can HOLD strong and reach 13 consecutive days \*of failure to deliver\* as a threshold security, then the shorts** ~~will~~ **(in theory) should have to cover the positions by buying GME shares or equivalent shares of like kind and quantity.** ~~If maths good, that puts Thursday Feb 4th as day #13.~~ **Ape hold strong.**

**\*\*Edit 5: Math not good. Jan 18th was holiday. We are at 37 consecutive days. Edit 3 &amp; 6 at bottom for more details.**

&amp;#x200B;

We've seen confusion, fear, uncertainty, and doubt surrounding what happened Monday Feb 1st. Remember that FUD is one of their greatest weapons against retail investors right now. They want to use it to divide retail and to convince people to sell based on emotion. I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!

**Warning: I am not a financial professional or a financial advisor. I read at a grade-3 level. This is not financial advice.**

\- Read below here if you can or care.

1. Why no squeeze Monday after $320+ close on Friday?

Shorts weren’t required to cover their positions on Monday. I think that they have T+2 (time of close + 2 business days) to cover their position. If true, this means they have until EoD Tuesday to cover. After that, they will have failed to deliver on the security. That isn’t good for them, but it isn’t as bad as it sounds. Failure to deliver is like a steppingstone in the process. After 5 consecutive business days with \*aggregate Failure To Deliver, the stock is listed as a threshold security. NYSE Threshold Securities can be checked here [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

It takes 13 consecutive days being listed as a threshold security before the positions must be closed **(If the rules still apply to them)**. \*I believe this is individual short positions that must be closed not all the shorts as a whole.\*

So, instead of covering, shorts spent the day driving the price down to a more favorable position for them. They may have scared away some paper hands along the way too.

2. How does that help the shorts?

Lower price means it costs less to cover and the Shorts have more room to negotiate with other funds. A cheaper darkpool buyout is good for them. If they can lower it enough, covering becomes a non-issue compared to a full on squeeze.

Shorts want to avoid days where GME fails to deliver and they want to create non-Failure To Deliver days to break the chain of consecutive failures to deliver. This is easier for them if the price is lower.

3. So squeeze on Tuesday/Wednesday right?

I don’t think the squeeze happens Tuesday or Wednesday. I think the shorts are setting up the next part of their plan. I think if the squeeze happens this week, it happens because the shorts reach 13 consecutive days where they fail to deliver. This means diamond hands and limiting the number of cheap shares that shorts can buy after ladder attacks aka diamond hands.

4. We’ve heard this before. So what?

I agree with the idea that adding RC &amp; friends to the board had a positive influence on the stock price. I don’t think that was the only thing happening when we saw price rise during mid-January. Going back to the idea of 13 consecutive days as a threshold security, we can refer to our NYSE tracker [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

~~Starting at the beginning of the year, we see that Jan 4th is the first day GME is marked as a threshold security~~.&lt;- True but it was already listed as a threshold security starting Dec. 8th. It stays listed as a threshold security through Jan 15th. Remember we don’t count weekends so the count resumes  January 19th (18th was a holiday) ~~January 18th. On the 18th, it falls off the list for the day and comes back on January 19th.~~ ~~Without this single day drop-off, the 13-day countdown would have ended at EoD Wednesday Jan 20th.~~ I believe that the price jump we saw can be partially attributed to the fact that \*some of\* the shorts NEEDED to avoid another Failure To Deliver or they would risk being uncovered. That was pre-spike. Now ~~they~~ some shorts are in a similar position closing in on \*their own\* 13th consecutive day. They will do whatever they can to avoid that 13th consecutive day because that means they will avoid having their record books searched through by someone outside their firm/fund.se

**Threshold Securities**

Def: Threshold Securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for

· Five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency; and

· Totaling 10,000 shares or more; and

· Equal to at least 0.5% of the issuer’s total shares outstanding.

If you see any mistakes or if I missed something, let me know. Looking to keep this as accurate and up to date as possible.

Edit 2: It has been brought to my attention that I didn't count Jan. 18th as a holiday when checking the threshold securities list. Going back to check my work now and will mark any edits that are made. Information will not be removed, but I will do my best to address any mistakes I have made. Thank you for your help.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 3: Dec. 25th, Jan. 1st, and Jan 18th were all holidays and NYSE was closed. Going back we see Dec. 8th has GME listed as a threshold security. It was correctly pointed out ( u/AlexGu812 ) that this brings us to 37 consecutive days. I don't know enough about this stuff to confidently say what that means. I think it may have to do with the close-out requirements or it could be a sign of bad faith actions.   ""The requirement to close out fail to deliver positions in threshold securities that remain for thirteen consecutive settlement days does not apply to any positions that were established prior to the security becoming a threshold security"" &lt;-- This may explain why we haven't seen mass closeouts despite passing the 13 day threshold.

For me, it is 1 of 18. Clicking the 98 hyperlink will take you to a written example provided by the SEC.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 4: If you feel this doesn't matter because the SEC won't enforce it then please consider contacting your representatives. Rules and regulations should be enforced. We can't encourage a lack of action just because things are hard or more complicated than we thought they would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 6:  The 37 consecutive days are the shit splatters on an otherwise decent toilet. Let's try to clean it up without automatically assuming foul play. This is a thought exercise, **but I do not know if it holds true in the real world.**

In the post, I refer to ""The Shorts"" as a collective, but that's incorrect to assume. Not all shorts are making the same decisions or acting at the same day/time. We know that Failure to Deliver is measured as an aggregate, which is a net balance. If delivered are (+) and failed are (-) then we can figure out if a security failed to deliver by seeing if the net total is positive or negative (my understanding is that as retail we get the data as it becomes available rather than being able to measure it ourselves in real time). Within that net total, some actors will deliver their shares and some will fail to deliver. **Just because a security fails to deliver on the day doesn't mean every actor has failed to deliver. It just means the aggregate is net negative (for this example).** If this line of thinking is correct, it is possible that no individual actor has failed to deliver a threshold security for 13 consecutive days.

**Again, edit 6 is a thought exercise. Additional input, comments, criticism, and other lines of thinking are welcome.**

As I'm sure many of you who have been following the ""Counterfeit Shares"" theory about the various short attacks on $GME have seen, the SEC publishes lagged data on the cumulative number of Fails to Deliver for every company. If you aren't caught up with the latest info on the counterfeit share theory, take a second and read [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/)'s \[post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the\_real\_reason\_wall\_street\_is\_terrified\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)) laying out the issue with hedge funds counterfeiting shares and how it relates to GME. Much of the analysis in Johnny's post comes from an article \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)) which is definitely worth a read if you have the time and patience to do a deep dive into the evil shit carried out by hedge funds.

**TLDR of Johnny's post:** Hedge funds create a bunch of stock out of thin air and short it, selling the counterfeit shares on the open market and driving the price of a company down. They then fail to come up with the shares they sold in time, so the ""counterfeit"" shares are never backed up by real shares. This could be happening on a massive scale with GME, and Hedge Funds could have far greater exposure to GME than previously thought.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Data:**

I noticed that while [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and later [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) used data from the SEC releases in their posts, the data they actually showed was only a small piece, and lacked very important context. So, with that in mind, I took the SEC Fails-to-Deliver data \[releases\]([https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)) for both halves of November and December and the first half of January and took a look at what was going on using some pivot tables. I thought given the sheer amount of data (1.5 million cells) it would be tough to load in Excel but it actually ended up being pretty easy. (probably helped that my day job is just alternately making pivot tables and slamming my head into the wall, I've gotten pretty good at both)

IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS RELEASE EXTENDS TO JANUARY 14TH, 2021. THESE ARE NOT CURRENT CUMULATIVE OUTSTANDING FAIL-TO-DELIVER LEVELS

&amp;#x200B;

**Fails-to-Deliver Distributions:**

First, take a look at this handy histogram(ish) of companies with outstanding Fails-to-Deliver and their outstanding ""counterfeit share"" (cumulative Fails-to-Deliver) numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/6dmfpfql47f61.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf38fea8f5de2e45b36b48853f4d7afaca8f6c28

As you can see, GME is way outside of the pack when it comes to Fail to Delivers, and has significantly more ""counterfeit shares"" (FTDs) than almost any other company. The exact number comes in at a cool 621,483 shares. The x-axis scale isn't even linear, and you can see significant jumps in the last quarter.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think that's some crazy shit, wait until you see the distribution of Fail-to-Delivers per company by the dollar value of counterfeit shares ((Closing Price)\*(# of Outstanding Fails-to-Deliver)):

https://preview.redd.it/024mdiv147f61.png?width=1616&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=270fc53a5455994545a864e8b8e9c304b0e57b5c

GameStop has the SECOND HIGHEST Fails-to-Deliver net dollar value of all 5,147 stocks with current fail-to-delivers (as of 1/14/21). NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS of stock floating around that was simply created out of thin air. Here the x-axis isn't even linear either — if it were to scale, GME would be several meters to my right. Wild.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cumulative Fails-to-Deliver of GME over Time:**

Moving on to more interesting (and potentially more troubling) data, I took a look at the Fails-to-Deliver values over time for GME. I decided to go back to the beginning of November, then look at every number the SEC had released since on FTDs for GME. This is crucial context for the numbers that have been thrown around by [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/).

https://preview.redd.it/myt4zxy347f61.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=603b5d5f0a623dc0dc9ef0df1f3da05e7361340f

Now, this one is a lot less clear-cut than those histograms I just wrote about. As you can see, there have been huge fluctuations in the amount of ""counterfeit stock"" (Fails-to-Deliver) on the market. There is a definite pattern of Hedge Funds running up Fails-to-Deliver during GME surges and then covering once the price slumps a bit. I've talked with one of my sources involved with hedge fund operations, and he said this is pretty standard procedure — when you sell a naked short and the price spikes, you talk it out with your broker and get a few more days to cover. So really, this pattern is more or less normal. It's the stupidly large amounts Fails-to-Deliver that are getting churned that is the irregular part.

Here's a good spot to bring up my main concern with the kind of analyses that [u/johnnydaggers](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnnydaggers/) and [u/Peteskies](https://www.reddit.com/user/Peteskies/) were putting out. You can see that there were 1.8 million Fails-to-Deliver on GME on December 2nd, but that number was basically completely covered by the 16th. Based on that data it seems at first glance that, for the most part, these reported Fails-to-Deliver are Hedge Funds/Brokers trying to avoid covering while high and simply waiting for the next dip. This data alone IS NOT SUFFICIENT to prove that there is an enormous, market-moving quantity of Fails-to-Deliver floating around the market. Of course, right after this data cuts out, GME shoots to the moon (300+), and I would expect a lot of naked short vendors were caught with their pants down. Maybe they all covered on the recent dips, maybe loads of Fails-to-Deliver are still out there.

A table with that GME info from the graph above for any lurking nerds:

&amp;#x200B;

**Some Questionable Inferences and My Retarded Conclusions:**

So, what's the takeaway here, other than don't trust everything you read on WallStreetBets? I think there are a few lessons. First, even though Fails-to-Deliver numbers were bouncing all over the place, including being completely covered on 12/16, I think it's important to keep in mind that GME having this volume of Fails-to-Deliver, both in shares and in dollars, is extremely irregular compared to everything else. Could just be the fact that GME is an insane stock with insane volatility,\* or could be indicative of something more.

*\*Yet, this data is from back before GME became mainstream — GME in December was not an ""unprecedented situation"" like we have now. Thinking back to then, the high Fails-to-Deliver numbers are even more significant.*

&amp;#x200B;

**A Possibility of Hedge Fund Armageddon:**

I want to take a second to talk about one of the diagrams from the good folks who wrote \[""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""\]([http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)), detailing both the ""surface level"" indicators of Disclosed Shorts and Fails-to-Deliver, and the below-the-surface hidden pathways that they believed pumped counterfeit shares into our financial system. Here it is:

https://preview.redd.it/v3io9bj847f61.jpg?width=1086&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21d67bbec3d7d4e3b2012b3d51cdaf462ae3318d

As you can see, the Counterfeiting 2.0 authors believed that Fails-to-Deliver were just the tip of the iceberg. Below the surface (and out of the sight of the SEC), they believed there was a massive volume of shares that had been ""laundered,"" through foreign exchanged, offshore funds, or even gaps in the Continuous Net Clearing system at the DTCC. These stocks, theoretically, go from Fails-to-Deliver to simple counterfeit shares, or even straight to counterfeits. The arguments in the Counterfeiting 2.0 paper go way over my head as a simple retard, but I get the gut feeling at least some of them are accurate.

If, hypothetically, (please read this part in your best Ben Shapiro voice), the arguments in Counterfeiting 2.0 are true, then it is highly likely that the huge Fails-to-Deliver churn on the surface is just the tip of a massive illegal counterfeit short position. GME BULLS, listen up. If this counterfeit short position does exist, then it was probably entered back when GME was being driven towards bankruptcy, at a share price somewhere in the $15/20 range, and possibly expanded when GME was being driven down below $5. There are actually interesting data to suggest that this is a plausible scenario. First, the fact that, as [/u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) noted a year ago, the market cap of GME was driven below the net value of its assets. Obviously, this happens from time to time, but it's indicative of an extremely artificially depressed valuation. Secondly, the central use of illegal naked shorting is in driving companies to bankruptcy, and it did seem like GME was on its way out. Looking at GME as a scummy hedge fund manager, it would have made a very attractive target for a naked-short dilution attack.

These illegal short positions, if they were not covered by cautious (lol) Hedgies at the beginning of the GME runup, would have increased 50-100x in dollar value as the share price of GME rose. That's 5,000-10,000% for those who can't do basic math. Now I don't know if this scenario would be enough to crash the market, but it would certainly be enough to make a lot of extremely powerful people (currently engaged in a criminal enterprise) desperate and very, very angry. This hardly needs saying, but rich bastards have killed for far less than a billion dollars. Here, there could be tens of billions on the line.

So, that's the mega-bull case. We, the tards of WSB, expose billions in financial crime. The SEC rappels into Citadel and arrests everyone, Robinhood goes bankrupt, and all our wives and their boyfriends get filthy rich. However, there is also a very significant BEAR case here. If the regular, everyday investors who wrote Counterfeiting 2.0 were in fact retards like us, then there's a significant chance that they simply got it wrong. Maybe there is no sea of hidden counterfeit short positions, and maybe this whole Fails-to-Deliver thing is just rich assholes using extra trading days to cheaply sell shorts. What then? In that case, I would bet my left nut that all of the outstanding Fails-to-Deliver have been covered in the recent slump, and this whole exciting report is largely irrelevant to the future performance of GME.

I'm not going to make the case that either the bulls or the bears are right (even though my gut is with the bulls) because I simply don't have the information or mental capacity to make that call. Look at the data yourself, and draw your own conclusions. Retail is facing an enemy with more capital, more information, more experience, and fewer morals. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be an ugly fight.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions: 12 shares (Bought 50 at $20, sold 50 at $250, bought back in 12 at $300). I plan to hold until either $4,000 a share or things go to shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a financial advisor, and I do not advise any readers to make financial decisions based on my opinions or the information presented in this report.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR: the cumulative Fails-to-Deliver volume on GME is massive compared to the rest of the market. However, is also extremely volatile, and small compared to the float. It is possible that high Fails-to-Deliver volume is a result of massive illegal share counterfeiting by shorts.

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‘08 ‘09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He’s working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his “Biden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment” which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it’s truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. “..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn’t even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

Yes, it is heavily manipulated. Yes, there is a shortage. Yes, there is a case for the inflation adjusted price being disconnected from current market value.   Yes, it has industrial use. Yes, it's the metal on your wife's bf's cock ring.

&amp;#x200B;

You're not wrong, but theres some major issues.

It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar market cap. There is a hard case for the WSB, if acting in collusion which it shouldn't, cause that's naughty, to move silver.

Citadel, et al own a real stake in silver. Maybe deal with one issue at a time.  They would be enriched by this play, which effectively undoes doing them dirty.  Do you really wanna give them a reach around while you're savaging their red little asses?

Think about who owns the physical good.  This would cause physical silver to rocket, enriching some pretty nasty despots (both political and financial). None of this exists in a vacuum.

Every time someone has tried to mess with the silver market at scale it's blown up in their faces. Especially the Hunt brothers (Silver Thursday in 1980).  They literally lost their billion dollar family fortune in the mid 80's (from the stuff stemming from 1980)

Precious metals are a far more liquid market, with far greater trading times, and more world markets effecting price.  This means there are more players.  WSB was the David in the GME story, and won't register on the Silver market. You have COMEX &amp; LBMA.

JPM is one of the big Market Makers.  Citadel et al aren't even a blip compared to JPM.

I'm saying it's not even bringing a knife to a gun fight.  It's bringing a rubber band gun to a nuclear arms meeting.

These MF's are gonna eat all your tendies for an appetizer and want more.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, the existing DD has had very very valid points.  Silver is logically a sound investment, especially after QE Eleventy Billion.  I'm saying bleach your mind of the thought of attempting to impact the silver market.

908,Why this is just a beginning: a guide for The GME Gang newcomers and a quick recap of the situation,2021-02-10 09:10:46,"Listen up you fucks, for most of you this is your first rodeo so let me tell you how this whole thing works. Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, 🌈🐻 keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

""I wish I bought at $9..."" - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $11..."" - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $17..."" - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $40..."" - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $60..."" - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy’s Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aimé of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the 🌈🐻s**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream ""WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ""

[http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210202.txt) (search GME; see also [2/1](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210201.txt), [1/29](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210129.txt), [1/28](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210128.txt), [1/27](http://regsho.finra.org/CNMSshvol20210127.txt))

[https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME](https://nakedshortreport.com/company/GME) (pretty plot, though the data are slightly different from the official data given in the links above; both sources confirm that short volume has been &gt; 50% total volume over the last five days, including today)

As an aside, according to that second website, [""if you see  more than 20% of your overall volume initiated short on a daily basis... you may be under \[a naked short\] attack.""](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades) SEC, a little help, please?

In any case, the day before Robinhood and other brokers instituted the restriction on GME share and option buying was the last day that more than ***50%*** of *all GME shares sold* were not sold short. Shorts have been going in even harder on their shorting while they know buying is difficult for us. We win if we hold.

This is pretty definitive that shorts are causing the current crash, and they definitely haven't covered when doing so. It's mathematically impossible for shorts to cover if more than 50% of all shares sold in a day were sold short. Shorts are instead continuing to double down. GME will eventually rise, especially if Cohen and friends give some good news anytime soon (e.g., official company roadmap released, Cohen and friends buying the remaining shares they can, etc.). It will rise regardless of good news because shorts don't want to pay interest forever if a stock trades sideways. And as soon as all of us can buy an unlimited amount again, we can squeeze them once again.

I've shared FINRA data on here before and gotten some questions which have at this point become predictable, so I'm going to answer them below.

# Couldn't shorts open their position and cover by the end of the day?

No, because more than 50% of all shares were sold short, there were not enough shares for them to cover the shares they sold short even if every single share purchased other than a short share today was sold from a long to a short. It's mathematically impossible. They had to add at least around 10% of the total volume each of the last five days to their short position (most days had about 55% of shares sold short (some even more), and 100 - 55 = 45% not sold short; 55 - 45 = 10% more shares sold short than shares sold long). And I know that I bought more over each of the last few days, as did you glorious autists, so it was probably more than 10% of the total volume they were adding per day for each of the last five days.

# The total volume from those websites is less than the day's volume that my broker or another site tells me was traded

Yes, that's because FINRA only records data from specific markets/exchanges, not all of them. Although the total volume is less than what is sold over the entire market, the *ratio* of short sales to total shares sold is representative of the entire market, because they pull from the biggest exchanges. As mentioned above, FINRA is also the highest quality short data; the official bimonthly short data that is published is by FINRA pulling from these same data. These data are accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: I am not a financial analyst and this is not financial advice. Make up your own mind about everything. Also, I am long GME. 

**Edit 2/3/21**: Short volume was over 50% of total volume today too. Hold, beautiful retards, hold. 💎 👐 

**Edit 2/4/21**: Short volume was again over 50% of total volume today. Hold, beautiful retards, hold. 💎👐

**TLDR:** Shorts have added a retardedly large amount of new short positions over the last five days. Keep holding, don't sell, and when you can buy more buy more. **GME to fucking Orion's belt 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**"

AMC going from +20% to remaining unchanged at 0% whilst GME goes to almost +10% and then remaining unchanged premarket at the exact same time will be the norm the coming time.

Vlad has often cited this 3rd party analyst claim, calling it a black swan event. Here's why that's a total crock.

This is not the first ever short squeeze. Nor was it the largest by any measure. The volatility of equities being squeezed is common knowledge and expected. GME **doubled** in price the 2 weeks leading up to the squeeze, on astronomical short interest. We all knew it was squeezing, why didn't Robinhood?

*""Yeah, but RH had so much more exposure than expected because so many retail buyers were buying it on their platform.""* Well, duh. Why do you think stocks squeeze? Because of retail hype. And not only did Robinhood have the data to know and expect their user base to be in big on the squeeze, **it's their freaking business model.** They actively highlight popular stocks to attract new users and entice trading activity.

Mark Cuban's AMA also put light on one issue: HFs won't want to close their shorts. Their plan is to drag this and leverage their sheer size on us. But we can beat them at their game by buying more and more shares at these lower prices. But don't despair if prices fluctuate under 100, under 80 or even under freaking 30. The more shares we can gobble up, the better.

Just remember:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Only risk what you can afford to lose.
2. This can drag on longer than any of us initially believed, so BE PATIENT. If you can't buy more my advice is to just go do something else. Forget about it. Remember rule #1? You only have money you can afford to lose in this, so why the rush?
3. Help out by upvoting good ideas, topics, doing DD, motivating people, being funny and generally entertaining. It all helps.
4. Have some fun. If you cannot have fun you probably have too much money on the line.
5. (Optional) - Instead of a trader's mindset. Adopt a Shareholder's mindset. You own a tiny bit of GameStop now. Go ahead, buy on their stores. Lift their business up and when Q1 numbers come out it will be a great deal of help for them.

My opinion is that unless I can find compelling evidence that the squeeze is truly done for and off the table, my conviction has only grown stronger.

Most important things that stick out, all of which really build a case that must not be dismissed:

1) If shorts have covered, we should have noticed reasonable strong upwards momentum, as buying pressure consists of short covering along with retail buying, and a limited float.

2) Past few days we've seen trading volumes below average, likely suppressed demand caused by broker restrictions on buying. Lower volume can make any dump pull the price down easily. Especially when the demand side is getting locked out. Have to mention the timing of which Robinhood locked buying last week as well, coinciding with a massive dip.

3) Look at [this image](https://preview.redd.it/dralf2uks4f61.png?width=1900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52223e916aacb4f65681da1cfe4f5e1ade7cea30)

Notice how AMC &amp; GME have almost identical candlesticks, and the same is in the BB-NOK pair. It is undeniable that a lot of people are buying this stock and holding this stock. Not just in America but all across the world. We have global support.
You would think that with this many people in the trade (whether they are on the buying / selling side) we would see greater variance. This correlation to me looks like obvious manipulation by higher frequency and higher volume algorithmic trading.
It's hard to look at these charts and say that this is natural supply and demand. Seriously, same candlestick patterns on unrelated stocks. This price action is influenced by targeted manipulation to a high degree. Even if people were really selling off like crazy, wouldn't we see more natural candles?

4) We have mainstream media (MSM) covering the ""reddit mania"" extensively. MSM says reddit is trying to squeeze silver, which is false. You will not find anyone pushing to buy SLV on reddit. In fact, you will see a warning about silver and how many HFs have long positions in it.

5) We've seen an influx of bots on social media (reddit, FB, twitter) promoting silver, spamming that GME squeeze is finished, diverting attention away from the more uninformed audience. Why? If it's finished why the need for these?

6) MSM says the short squeeze mania is over and shorts have covered. If that is true, why are we seeing trade restrictions still on more and more brokers, and nonstop coverage all over TV and the internet. If it's over, why are there so many articles bashing retail to stay away?

7) GME is an outlier in the ""failed-to-deliver"" statistic, and has been put on NYSE short restriction (uptick rule). Something fishy is going on with the shares in the float.

8) SI% numbers are very conflicting. Especially the numbers that came around 30-50%. It was then later mentioned by someone in S3 that a different calculation was used. If you convert to the old calculation, you still get over 100% SI%. Why are they trying to change it all of a sudden?

To me, this is enough to say we're still in the game. If it's over, let them prove it by crushing GME to $20 and on February 9th we hear the official SI% being low. Then it's finished. Something tells me that it's not over, and this is all a ploy to mitigate the damage they are about to receive when GME eventually triggers the MOASS.

Can't say for sure it's a 100% trip to the moon and beyond, but what's really suggested otherwise? This whole misinformation campaign + price manipulation combo is too important to dismiss.

Remember I'm retard and please make your own financial decisions. This post is based on my observation and speculation.

It is possible, but people need to stop being next level retard. It is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on what's actually going on. So while I don't know shit and this isn't real financial advice, here's a more rational take on what we need to do to get GME moving again.

Full disclosure: I was in GME in early December at around $15, I was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for Jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely. I got back in immediately for Feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k. I took some profits on the way up (I felt bad for doing so but I knew it was the big brain move, and in the end I pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me). I'm still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for Feb 19th, and made more 250 calls recently for Feb 26th and Feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday. I'm holding all of these till bust, so I'm in it to the moon. I have some shares too but those are a long play, I don't look at them.

First, we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done. The factors that led to it have changed, either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices (around 200 most likely), or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us. WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE ORIGINAL SHORT SQUEEZE TO REVIVE THIS STOCK. WHAT WE NEED IS AUTHENTIC BUYING AND NEW MOMENTUM.

On that note, stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume. What we need is real, authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200. But right now GME looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole. So how do we fix that? We still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the GLOBE that want a part in this once in a lifetime story. This is powerful but has to be used right, and that's hard when the brokers are shutting us out. But hope is not lost, and restrictions should lift over time. We need patience and resilience.

We also need to stop telling people who aren't in this for the moment to hold till they die. Some people are losing REAL money over this and we're being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies. Weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the FUD worse. If we want a come back we need the selling to stop, and that means we need to let the weak hands fold WHILE keeping the floor price above a certain level. Let's talk about volume. The recent 'low volume' isn't low compared to the past months, its just lower than the day when GME was THE MOST TRADED STOCK IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Stop talking about volume. REAL selling has happened, which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding. We need to let this energy run its course. Don't act like it's going to the moon and to buy at any price, save our bullets for the hard line in the sand.

Once the selling has stopped (and it will), we just need to regain momentum with organic buying.  People all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for GME to look like its picking up steam again and they will PILE THE FUCK ON just like last time. If we push the price high enough, we can trigger another short squeeze but it is NOT the same conditions as the first one. Stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks (which I've only heard of on this reddit) and us being cheated by the big man, that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable. It is STILL a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again, the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story. Whether it is or isn't, that only creates more FUD.

This sub needs to get its shit together. We need real authentic I LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK for reasons OTHER than the short squeeze. Like GME just adding a fucking Amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online. There is REAL REASON to believe in GME, and that needs to turn into authentic buying, which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again. But this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10,000 or bust needs to stop. It's just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief. This stock has real potential to hit $300+ again, we just have to change our mind set and the game plan. And I'm too stupid to tell you how, but I know this isn't the way. So buy the fuck out of GME at current levels, but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality. And tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going. We have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again, its not over. But its gonna require patience and time and if you aren't in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again. At this point, if you're not buying, either get off the ship or hold till death do us part.

Best of luck retards, I know we can do this"

962,"GME urgent RE-EDUCATION - unify, clarify, focus and execute",2021-02-03 04:40:06,"How can I start this.. the paradigm that defines our role on GME needs urgent and drastic clarification  if we are to steer this thing back onto the road.Whether we want to admit it or not, we're fucking drifting atm. The hype is dying as all hypes do, the whole thing is glued with spit and running on pure randomness and doom inevitability (""we're all poor so we don't care, it's either moon or bankruptcy"").

TH THA THA TH, time out.

Listen up fucktards, I'm poor too, but that's not the point. We need to go over the whole situation with perspective, and this is not some detailed nerd shit so it'll go easy on your 2 braincells.  


Repeat after me: we are not gonna trigger the short squeeze. WE ARE NOT GONNA TRIGGER THE SHORTSQUEEZE.  
It's easy to fall into disbelief by misunderstanding our part in all of this. We are not triggering shit, so all the retards YELLING buy buy buy every time it starts to go up need to come back to reality. It's NOT our job to trigger the short squeeze nor would we be able to.  


Picture a roman colosseum (an old stadium you mongs). In the middle of the arena, down in the pit you have all the shorters doing their thing, having a jolly good time. There's several tunnels surrounding the pit and leading OUT to freedom. 

To get the short squeeze we need them right there in the pit, so that's done. They're already there, shorting GME to shit, not by 13% which was enough to rocket VW share price 5X back in 2008, but by a staggering 50% to 130% (numbers irrelevant, point is the ammo is more than enough). As you can see there's plenty of shorters in the pit, so they're confident and comfortable.

  
Now, for the shortsqueeze to work you need 2 things:

\- a boogeyman  
\- something blocking the goddamn exit  


The boogeyman is ANYTHING that makes them fear for their billions and run for the exit trampling each other on the way out. The less shares available for them to cover their shorts the smaller this boogeyman can be, because they will panic knowing they may not be able to cover at all, meaning THE END.   
It could be literally a thousand different things, and the longer we go into the future the more likely that something will HIT. Could be someone scooping up an extra slice of the company (Ryan Cohen for example), earnings blowing out, anything. And this company has received SO MUCH free advertising in the last few weeks it's not unreasonable to think that they are at a historic turning point (not gonna get into the reasons why it's already a great value investment), and it will soon show.  


THEN, we come.  
We, the group of INDIVIDUALS that happen to be investing in the same stock because we like it.

What are we? We are bodies.  
Pilling up.  
On the fucking exits.

The more shares you own the fatter you are, and the fatter you are the more space you take up on the exit. And my friend my friend, the hedgies are REALLY gonna need the exit when the boogeyman shows up.  


Our role here is to buy as many shares as we can in order to clog the exit doors, so that the shorters have no way out when a boogeyman comes.If something big drops and there's not enough unflinching share ownership (buyers that won't sell no matter what), then the shorts will just make their way out and fuck all will happen.

Sure, there must be a lot of individuals and institutions unwilling to sell to bail shorts if they need to cover, say most of the GME board for example and maybe a couple institutions, but likely not nearly enough.

That's our part. If say half the people on WSB buy an average of 5 shares, that would be nearly 20 million shares. That's nearly 1/3 of the total GME shares available.If say, over a month we are able to turn that average into 10 per person, half of WSB would own a staggering 60% of all the shares, and you may say oh well that's not possible BUT JUST THINK ABOUT IT, many among us have investments in the hundreds of thousands, some even millions. Each one of those can bring the average up a hell of a lot.Heck, even I with my 20 shares god bless them, can make up for 3 people on WSB that bought nothing.  


Time really is on our side, if we just keep gobbling up shares we can really block those exits for the shorts, and when the time comes they will panic because they will realise there simply aren't enough shares to cover - GME goes straight to the MOON.

We don't need to worry at all, there is no losing here because mathematically it's a time bomb.THIS WILL NOT SURVIVE ON HYPE.HYPE IS NOT OUR FRIEND.Understanding the situation and calmly and patiently executing is how we can succeed.  


We need to unify, clarify, focus and execute.  


&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR -**

**The GME gang is losing its way because its all hype now. Hype will kill this because hype dies.We need to clarify our role and execute with patience. We don't trigger short squeezes, our function is to accumulate as many shares as possible so that when the time comes and something big and positive drops, the shorters try to cover but can't because we have all the stock (or most of it), they panic and GME moons.Basically the only thing that matters is to keep accumulating as many shares as you can, and to understand your role. This diamond hand shit is NOT needed because the price is irrelevant, it's the inevitable math of the short squeeze that matters and that's where the focus needs to be.**  


&amp;#x200B;

Obviously this isn't financial advice and everyone here does whatever the fuck they want anyways."

968,GME long. DFV had it right on the fundamentals in market context and still has it right.,2021-02-11 22:00:29,"**Listen up Retards, I have no idea idea what I'm talking about, but you should stop panic selling and get back in GME, HODL, and DO NOT LOOK at your balance for the next six months.** 

I'm late to GME and bought into the hype. Every day I've been tracking GME and got really close to selling, but before I sold, I decided study u/deepfuckingvalue activity for insights into why GME. I found a comment about that locked me in and want to discuss with you retards.

The news screams at us that the market is over valued. Time and time again a company has $40bn market cap on a measly $2bn revenue with $500mm profits. Who in their right minds would say a company is worth $40bn when it would take 80 years to see ROI. OVER VALUED TRASH. Even UBER report billions in losses but institutional investors are still riding a wave on overvalued trash, why shouldn't we do the same? 

GME is a good buy compared to loads of other OVER VALUED trash on the market. 

&gt;People talk up the demise of GameStop yet here they are about to generate over $2b in revs in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle. - u/deepfuckingvalue 

$2bn in revenue in a quarter is not bad. In 2020, GME had revenues of $6.5bn with $300mm in losses down from $8.3 revenue with $491mm in losses in 2019--their worst year since each year before they were turning a profit. Amid a global pandemic GME manages to hold onto revenue and contain losses, they even came close to a profit in Q420 with only $20mm in losses down from $84mm in Q419--amid a global pandemic with Q420 ending in October and not including holiday sales.

Look at UBER and SNAP. In 2020, UBER had $14.15bn in revenue AND $8.6 BILLION IN LOSSES yet currently $113bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. Or SNAP. In 2020 it had $2.5bn in revenue, $945mm in losses and currently has $94bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. 

If GME is over valued trash like these smart buys then it must be valued at $100bn, maybe $50bn. But wait, GME market cap rests at a modest $3.4bn. WTF?? So you mean to say GME's revenues are 2x its stock market value while closing in on losses but UBER and SNAP are killer buys with $100bn market cap with no end to their bleeding $$. THE EXPERTS SAY ITS BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL!!!

&gt;The “shift to digital” thesis is way overblown. - u/deepfuckingvalue

The financial news screams at us saying digital has killed brick in mortar, blah blah blah, we live inside computers now--see PROOF we are on WSB ALL DAY!! If brick and mortar were dead then why would Amazon purchase Whole Foods? Why do companies like PELOTON have retail stores ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? Why did e-commerce sales only represent 11% of all retail sales in the US in 2019? BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS WAY OVERBLOW BULLSHIT THEY FEED US.

GME has losses, sure, but they are containing costs with revenue exceeds their entire stock market value. GME is bringing in loads of $$ and their nearly contained losses are way under leading trash-buy stocks like UBER and SNAP. Brick and mortar is alive even in a pandemic--just wait until after the pandemic. People like to visit shops and get their buy on quickly--that's why AMZ bought Whole Foods and online retail only represents a fraction of brick and mortar retail sales. GME is not going anywhere anytime soon. GME is undervalued compared to the rest of the trash on the overvalued market. That's why I'm holding, will stop looking at the ticker price, and will no longer join in discussion about GME on WSB. 

See you all in the summer of 21   ✋💎🤚

That's what they're trying to do.

They're trying to make you believe they covered their calls but we've seen today they didn't, they're giving you false hopes to later crush them all and make you feel like shit.

This'll probably work on the weakest of us who will sell cause of this, so the price may fall, except for another thing, as counterintuitive as it may sound (and a psychological war often is counterintuitive) they may even buy a lot of shares to let you see those big green candles to later sell everything and make you see the huge red candles caused by their selling and by the other investor's panic selling.

My goal is not to make money.

My goal is not to lose money.

I am not trying to send a message.

I do not care about your upvotes.

I will not be donating any proceeds to charity. Namely because my goal implies that there will be no proceeds.

My goal is to ***own GameStop***. As absolutely much of it as I possibly can, while I am alive and on this planet.

Because of this, I *want* GME shares price to go down. Whether this occurs due to algo-driven price suppression or organic selling-off of shares. The more the value drops, the more shares I can afford to buy.

obligatory: Not financial advice. I like the stock. I fully expect everyone to watch me lose money on this.

-------------------------

Here are the facts:

1) **Mark Cuban raised a very valid point.** 

If you are investing in a company, the way we *used* to, as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company, then prices going down is a good thing. Cheaper cost of entry / position expansion. 

2) **GameStop is poised to d.o.m.i.n.a.t.e. the space within the gaming industry.**

Looking to build Esports arenas? Guess what, gyms are going out of business left and right. Cheap real estate.

Dedicated gaming streaming channel? Disney and others are already on that bus for their niches, so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming, would be no surprise. I'm not talking about livestreams, I'm talking about *produced* content.

Speaking of live, Twitch? Discord? Already set up, and instead of competing, GameStop could literally just *buy* these companies and relabel them Gwitch and Gamescord (or leave them as is, just own the revenue streams).

There are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub (epicenter, really) for such a massively exploding industry (an industry with zero sign of slowing down. Ever). 

Entertainment as an all-things umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable, and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly. *Interactive* entertainment is just unrivaled.

3) **The man, the legend, the boyfriend to all of our wives, DFV/Roaring Kitty/Mr. G, just doubled his shares position.** He undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on GME would have on the stock, and I have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values (remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up? I didn't do the math, and I'm not gonna, but I'd be willing to bet money that he didn't turn 100% of those profits into shares anywhere near the top).

Because of this, he has negative downside risk (GameStop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead). I'm in a much *much* smaller, but similar boat. I made $100K, and kept 100 shares, which I fully intend to take to my grave. This is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place.

4) **GameStop will never be forgotten.** This is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time. The face of investing will be changed forever because of WSB and the GME phenomenon. Even if there are not new regulations / trade taxes, the world will always *always* remember ""G.M.E.""

5) **I am just fine, financially.** My small business generates $100K to $250K/year in revenue. This is not a YOLO play. I can afford to lose the money I am putting in. Do not slide into my DMs seeking financial assistance. See above, where I discuss proceeds and how they won't exist, so there's no money anyway.

--------------------------------

**The Plan:**

- Buy *as many shares* as I can afford, never expecting to see that money ever again.

- Sell a few covered calls way in the future, at or out of the money. As they approach expiration, roll them forward another year. This will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops, or secure (and yes, limit) upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value. As long as these options do not get exercised, I will still own the shares. I would prefer these options expire worthless so I may expand my share count over the 25-35% cash ROI every year (see below somewhere).

- As I earn more money externally, buy more shares. Again, as many as I can afford. Every. Single. Year. Just constantly expand my position. No matter what. Forever.

- ????

- Profit, never. Not ever sell a single share. Use any capital gained from selling covered calls to, you guessed it, buy more shares.

------------------------------------------

Remember, my goal here is to own shares, not to make money. Any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares. Any money earned externally that I do not need access to will be turned into more shares.

Currently at-the-money covered calls expiring 1/21/22 (about a year out) are effectively worth 35-40% of the value of the stock. Assuming the stock value declines or stagnates YoY, then I could theoretically increase my position by a solid 35% each year. Yes, there will be a decrease in IV in this case, but using externally-earned money I should be able to make up the difference.

------------------------------------------

- **First milestone:** overtake u/DeepFuckingValue in share volume. I will never beat his % gains, and I may never exceed his actual cash value returns, but that is fine. My goal is purely share count. 

- **Second milestone:** overtake Ryan Cohen in share volume. My understanding is that he currently owns 9 million shares. I haven't dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type ""ryan cohen gamestop shares"" and I'm not gonna. Anything further is basically the deep web and 9 million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated. I am confident that I will fail at my second milestone, as it would likely be reliant on Ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life, before I get old and die.

- **Third milestone:** Own, run, and manage GameStop. Whatever that means. Member of the board, sure? Bust in on meetings like ""Hey I own most of this place, someone grab me a coffee."" and then yell about how ""I pay your salary!"" as I'm being escorted out by security, more likely. But I'm not gonna stop until I am at the head of that table, even if I have keep at this until I am 85 years old, or even if it happens right before GameStop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt.

------------------------------------------

With this strategy, cumulatively expanding my position by 35% YoY, I should be able to turn a 1,000-share portfolio into a 8million-share portfolio in 30 years. This is just based on current prices, options values, and my current income.

It couldn't bother me less if it goes to $1, $0.50, or $0.25 per share. At a certain point, cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock.

I like this stock, and if that means I end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then I will consider my life a massive success.

------------------------------------------------------

The **only** disappointment I could possibly experience with this plan (it's not even a strategy at this point), would be if GME finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised, calling all my shares away from me, increasing my net worth by 35% all at once. 

Or if GME just does really well organically, which would significantly slow down the rate at which I could expand my ownership in shares.

Becoming a millionaire would be cool and all, but I'm trying to do something specific here.

SEC interns: I'm just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone. I just like the damn stock.

Hedgies and MMs: please crank up your algos to maximum. Never stop doing what you're doing. I need this thing continually dropping so I can keep my covered call money and amass shares YoY.

Current 💎🙌 shareholders: you are the only thing standing in my way, and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all y'all's meme-ass prices. If at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits, I will thank you for it. If you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it (maybe shoot for buying back in lower), I'd appreciate that even more.

----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I'm going to be updating y'all weekly or monthly or annually, whatever. Might be a little bit to get started, as I'm currently working to get all of my cash out of RH and somewhere better. But hey, I have 30 years to get this sorted out, right?

Make fun of me as I lose money. Ask me for advice as I make money. Call me an idiot for the platforms I use. Try to sell me access to your crappy web-based indicator research tools. None of it will matter. Whether I am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a coin-toss of whether or not GME becomes 'fundamentally' valuable, I suppose.

**tl;dr - there is no tl;dr I am posting this just so I can reference it later when sharing my GME lifelong investor updates**

edit 1: [current positions, which will change as I enact my genius plan; yes I will post the first official update soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp0cgi/just_uploading_proof_for_another_post_please/)

----------------------------------------------------------

edit 2: To clarify a few things for those who apparently can't sense where some choice satire/irony/sarcasm is within this post, as well as those who straight up can't do math:

- **Anyone who didn't chuckle at least a little bit at ""Gwitch"" and ""Gamescord"" is for sure dead inside.** 

Yeah, Twitch may be out of reach, but check out the timelines of Twitter adding pics, Instagram adding videos, and Vine existing (yes, vine is dead, but TikTok took over that vibe). I guarantee you something will be the ""Next Twitter"" or the ""Next Instagram"" or the ""Next Tiktok"". It likely will not literally replace these things, but it *will* provide the next thing users want that hasn't been addressed. And it will grow too big to get back the audience these 3 giants will have lost. Something similar *could* happen with gaming. And if GameStop makes it (or buys the small service outright before they get too big to be bought), then the prophecy will have come true.

- **Sick burns, everyone.** 

I have not laughed this hard reading comments here since I first discovered WSB. I absolutely love you guys. The adderall bits in particular are gold. Yes, I am at baseline as of writing this stuff (my baseline is high as a my risk tolerance). Apologies for the length and lack of formatting and emojis. This was really just supposed to be for me to point at later when people are all ""Why exactly are you doing this?"" on future posts. As Blaise Pascal said, I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.


----------------------------------------------------------


edit 3: **Okay, basic math time.** Yes I calculated this with what few crayons I had not eaten, so y'all can relax and let me do the reeeeing for you:

If you have $100 and you make 10% return, you then will have $110. If with that new amount ($110, you following?) and you make another 10% return, now you have $121. Now I know it seems like you should have $120, and some of you seem to think that in order to turn $100 into $121 that I would have to add $21 of my own money from somewhere else. But this is the magic of how % ROI woks and a little thing called *cumulative* returns.

Okay, gonna keep this in dollars for a moment, just so you guys can follow and I don't lose anyone (though it seems many of you stopped reading at ""Gwitch"" anyway, and those are probably the only people here who could follow this elaborate and complex algorithm).

Let's say you own $1,000 and you can make 35% returns each year, for 30 years. This would be calculated as $1,000 x 1.35^30. Type that into a calculator and you'll get over $8Million. Trust me, and trust your calculator. This isn't magic. It's investing.

Now, if you own 1000 share of a company, and you call sell call options on those shares for 35% of the value of said shares, then it *does not matter* what the share price is (as the price goes up, so does the value of that call option, as the price goes down... surely you get it by now). If you quickly reinvest that money into the *same shares* at the *same price* then you will have increased your holdings by 35%. On a yearly basis, assuming the stock value ends at or below your strike price by expiration, *and* assuming the IV remains high enough to do it again the following year, then you could just do it again once that all expires worthless. Only now you can do it with 1300 shares (1400, if you go ahead and just buy 50 more). At this rate, you would theoretically end up with 8 million shares at the end of 30 years.

If you can secure 5% more shares cumulatively on a *weekly* basis, without them ever getting called away from you, would own over 323 million shares within 5 years.

**tl;dr (for real real this time)** If the stock literally ends every week lower than the previous week, and ends every year lower than the previous year, forever (**and** assuming the volatility remains high *or* that I can make up the difference via infusions of cash externally)... Then I'm gonna own all of GameStop somewhere between 5 and 30 years from now. If the stock goes up consistently, especially if it goes up significantly, then it will be very difficult to accomplish this. Because math.

974,Why buying AMC helps save a beloved American company on top of unleashing a devastating squeeze on hedge funds.,2021-01-30 05:06:52,"As we all know, AMC is the [second most shorted stock in existence](https://www.highshortinterest.com/), behind only GME of course. However, the actual situation between the two companies could not be more different. GME was never really at risk of bankruptcy. GME always had more cash than debt and was paying back debts ahead of schedule, because it has a flexible business model where it can easily close down underperforming stores, which GME did in large numbers this past year. In place of the underperforming stores, GME is expanding furiously into e-commerce. With RC now at the helm strategically, its future is bright.

AMC is in the exact opposite situation. It operates theaters, which it cannot close down without permanent, serious consequences. There is very little room for AMC to cut operating losses during the pandemic. There is no e-commerce pivot. It has theaters, and that's it. For a while now, AMC has been teetering on the edge of a cliff, facing a massive debt load and mounting operating losses, while hedge funds were relentlessly building short interest on its stock like a flock of locusts. AMC had been just a step away from Chapter 11 several times. The shorts almost won.

****This is where we come in.****

The recent rise in AMC's stock price is not just a middle finger to the short interest hedge funds. It is a lifeline to the **real world** operations of AMC. A few days back, one of AMC's debt holders [converted $600 million worth of debt into stock](https://deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/), and there were additional share offerings and other debt conversions.

&gt;It an SEC filing this morning, AMC said it will be issuing around 44.4 million shares of Class A common stock to Silver Lake and related noteholders in the transaction, which will reduce its debt by $600 million.

&gt;Earlier this month, AMC stockholder Mudrick Capital Management also swapped AMC debt for equity, in this case 14 million shares, plus another 8 million as a fee for separate loan.

&gt;As part of its recently announced fundraising, AMC yesterday finished issuing a further $300 million of equity at $4.80 a share.

&gt;It’s been a wild ride for the nation’s largest exhibitor but CEO Adam Aron told Deadline Monday that the chain should have cash enough to ride out the year.

Now, a valid concern might be that the additional stock offerings will increase float and ease the pressure on the shorts. But that didn't happen! The good news aspect of these moves significantly outweighs the additional float. With the freedom to raise capital and reduce debt load, the threat of bankruptcy is all but gone. The shorts will not win anymore, it's just a matter of how much they lose. 

This movement is legitimately saving a real American company. This is not patriotic jingoism. AMC, by the nature of its business, employs US residents and supports local economies across the entire country. AMC is a huge corporation but at the same time extremely local and intimate. The vast majority of its screens are in the US, with a solid representation in Europe as well. Yeah, the popcorn is overpriced, but at least it's going into the pockets of US residents and circulating in the local economy. 

And the enemy? Bloodsucking vampire hedge funds who literally produce NOTHING and do NOTHING except amass capital through underhanded and despicable means. 

This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to smash those hedge funds and save a beloved company at the same time.

This is not financial advice. I just love the stock, and hate hedge funds."

Think about the hype of this subreddit, 1k is not a meme is the mindset of most people still. we are sitting at 320 AH, and the germans are going to have to do some work to get us higher in the pre market tomorrow. The goal is to close green EVERY SINGLE DAY THIS WEEK. It’s the way that GME gets squeezed. A realistic way is if we maintain hype. Billboards, planes flying fuck you robinhood. Remember that we are not actually organized. And tomorrow is the start of what I think is the most crucial day for GME. The swings will be wild, a lot of people have transitioned to fidelity and more and more are coming. We need the eurobros to hold for us. They will tire us, they will start to seed doubt into your mind. Do not let them. Hold strong, hold steady, the squeeze has not happened yet.

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you’d expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can’t trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we.

This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close &gt;50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

&gt;A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

&gt;Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
&gt;Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926–2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt’s 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers’ Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
&gt;By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged—March 27—silver fell to $10.80, the metal’s biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, “A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be,” the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
&gt;To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978–91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities."
