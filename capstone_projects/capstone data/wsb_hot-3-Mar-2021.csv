10,Something isn't right.,2021-03-03 08:28:01,"Edit 3: *ZJZ reply is at the top of the thread. Please, be kind. I tried to summarise the feelings of users in this post, so we don't need to continue griefing the mod team... You could say... I LIKE the mod team.*

Why did we not get transparency about how g√¶mstonk megathreads were going to be handled, ahead of time?

First, the thread wasn't made.

Then the threads made by users were being manually deleted.

Then we got a comment stickied to the top of the daily thread saying words to the effect of ""no more g√¶mstonk daily threads, more news later.""

That comment got deleted.

Then we're told ""it's because interest in g√¶mstonk has died down"" (???????? Do you people LOOK at your own subreddit?)

Then RKT gets a sticky. It gets MASS brigaded by the rightly fucked off g√¶mstonk pushers.

Then we get told that the mods simply ""forgot"" to make the g√¶mstonk thread.

Then finally, it was because Opinion forgot to set an alarm.

...

What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On?

You don't want people to believe in conspiracies? Act homogeneously and transparently.

I haven't seen ANY good DD on g√¶mstonk for DAYS even though there is TONS of important movement going on with it. Somehow RKT is the ONLY majorly mentioned DD ticker on Monday? Somehow *that alone justifies a sticky?*

That precedent is extremely dangerous. I hope you have highly competent tools that protect against vote manipulation and spam... because if all it takes is a single highly rated post and ticker the day before to earn a sticky the following day... you leave the entire subreddit vulnerable.

As a side note... Everyone believes 3/19 is the MOASS date... BUT OPEN INTEREST IN g√¶mstonk IS HIGHER THIS FRIDAY. THIS. FRIDAY.

I am extremely bullish on GME and in my opinion this is the second best time to buy. It can't only go up. But if momentum is there... it can. I doubt MM's have delta'd for 200. 250. 300. 350... for this Friday, because right now it's limping at 115. And there are 24,000 calls at 800 for Friday. That is just ASTRONOMICAL.

Movement is best THIS WEEK.

Nobody knows it... because all the front page g√¶mstonk text posts are just straight dumpster garbage. Zero information. All fluff. And people wonder why they think it's a dead play, a dumb play. 

I don't want to believe asinine theories like top-down manipulation. So some clarity on this is going to deeply alleviate that poisonous sentiment.

Edit: there is a mod reply, please don't downvote it.

Edit 2: this is a really good time to remind retail that... we are a significant force. Decoherent, stupid, self destructive... but sometimes even a room full of monkeys all throw their shit in the same direction. So just be more conscious of what that direction is.

Edit 4: I censored the ticker to avoid spam from bots. Guess it worked. Had hardly any (like one?) Emoji/stupid comment."

19,GME PLEASE READ,2021-03-03 00:08:02,"Ok look apes, I have been following the GME trends since before the first squeeze. Needless to say, much like the rest of you, I have spent hours upon hours looking at the trends, shorts, and data since the day of reckoning last month.

**And with the jump last week there has been a lot of paper hand BS/ Misinformation being spread** (especially with RKT)

EDIT: As someone rightfully pointed to RKT is not bad, just the bots and the public narrative is a bit suspect IMO

**To simply put it,** in my opinion, **we are on the verge of something big**...

**TL:DR at the bottom for the most atuist**

Here is why my fellow tards,

1. **We have proven the community strength**, A LOT I MEAN A LOT of us have held and held until we were finally seeing some **green** for the first time in weeks. I mean serious green, despite the quote on quote ""**Lackluster day**"" we are still up **162.5%** the past WEEK!
2. **A stock with relatively little discussion on this page (IN COMPARISON TO GME) (RKT) is suddenly piking 50,60,70% increase???** Not to knock any fellow apes who invested (hopefully we will see a dump in GME soon after) but **it is so suspicious that a large movement into RKT aligns with the GME rise.** Don't take my word on this, but we have seen in the past other **""GAMMA SQUEEZE"" for fill in the blank as soon as GME has spiked, and what happens after? They fall and fall hard.**
3. The HF are scared, bad. With news breaking about Melvin and Citadale breaking over the past week, we know **that they have lost billions.** Not only that , they have continued to short the stock with heavy volume. Now with naked shorting, no one knows what the present of the float is exactly, but the estimate remains high.

**Now why you might ask losing roughly 50% of your entire capital important? If you are an autist, and I know you are, let me explain.** I mentioned this in my last post, but essential without capital, **how can HF run effective short latter attacks as we saw after the enormous initial spike? They can't- or at least we hope- with what we have seen over the past few days, GME has not seen any significant short latter attacks, heck we have gone up $20 alone this week!!! (EVEN WITH THE MARKET SHITTING ITS PANTS)**

4) **With contracts being exercised last week at around $55 dollars, we saw a gamma squeeze occur.** Now I have seen 5+ people on here explain wildly differing theories ranging from, if we hit 130 it will trigger the next squeeze, or on 3/15 the squeeze will happen! Now we can all take this with a grain of salt, after all, we are apes. **But what we can do is hold and continue to break resistance, yesterday was $113, today it was $120.** In my opinion, if we continue to rise steadily we can trigger another ITM call and see another squeeze.

5) **I know that to your paper hands this will kill you, but if the squeeze never happens GME is a great long-term hold. Here is why:**

\-They have landed a **huge** multi-year deal with micro soft.

https://preview.redd.it/7dvfklepdpk61.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5b6fb6667ffa99e41bb73b473f9ecb0f25e8f9d

\-**They fired their insanely incompetent CFO Jim Bell,** seriously look him up dude was a douche.

this shows seriously **promising financial redevelopment for GME.**

&#x200B;

\-**New wave of modernization in the gaming world. As a gamer myself, not to brag, I would love to see GME rise and take over as the ultimate streaming platform, and with the new push for the future and deals that just landed, I think that there is a pretty good chance this will happen.**

**TL:DR- IMO I think we have this. There is clear panic on the HF sides, we are up $20 from Monday with a shit ass entire market, there have been no outstanding short latter attacks, HF is down billions with high interest, there is a flood for a ""NEW SQUEEZE RKT"" (DISTRACTION), we have been stable and we are holding. IMO if we break resistance at 130, there will be some serious momentum.**

**IN SORT HOLD THE MF LINES RETARDS- I am not an advisor we just like the stock.**"

23,I love this community... but we need to talk.,2021-03-03 12:58:35,"I've been a longtime lurker in this sub, even before I grew a pair and started dipping my toes into the market.  The variety of people, the thoroughness of their research, and the veracity with which they defend it, make this place what it is.  

I only began trading as a side hustle at the start of the pandemic (with modest success).  My biggest wins came from WSB.  When the real push on GME started, I was there.  I was a bag holder of GME after January, but my bag wasn't too large  and I liked the stock, so I grew some diamond hands and held.  I started really following the day-to-day threads, reading every piece of financial news I could, watched Bruce eat his bagels, and developed a much deeper understanding of the market in general.  

I don't listen to all the advice I see on here... and I don't blindly trust DD.  

Why I feel I need to post today:  
The mood in this sub has changed drastically over the last 24 hours.  The rift I see between the GME folks and the RKT folks saddens me greatly.  I don't know exactly how I fee about RKT... something just seems too contrived about it.

I've seen some DD that suggests it's a HF ploy to pull people out of GME.  If that's the case, I don't think it will be successful.  GME apes are strong.  You don't just lose your diamond hands on a whim.

I've seen other DD that suggests it's a HF hedge and their using this to boost their capital in order to better defend their position in GME/AMC.  This seems a bit more plausible to me, but I'm  still not 100% convinced.  A lot of people are posting massive gains (sincere congratulations). 

What conclusion I have come to is this.  If I were a HF or a MM who needed WSB to fracture, I would seed disunity and distrust among the community.  I would send every bot or shill I could in every direction.  Some strongly defending RKT, some tearing it down.  Some screaming GME is dead, while others quietly suggest taking gains from RKT and rolling them into UWMC.  I wouldn't suggest a shit stock that I knew nobody would listen about... I would use my best DD and find something that could tear attention away from GME and tear the community apart.  And unfortunately, I think it's starting to work.  Just reading the daily discussion thread for today is like watching two 3-year-olds argue about what superhero would win in a fight.  

I love this community.  I hope that some of you may read this and that it may make a small difference.  When it comes to money, it's easy to manipulate peoples feelings.  I just hope that in the end, Apes Together Strong is the sentiment.

Good luck today everyone, and thank you."

26,Keep Your Eyes on the Volume Behind the Movement,2021-03-02 22:39:46,"**The Key to Success has Been Underneath Your Nose the Entire Time**

The key detail that every new trader seems to miss is that volume ultimately controls price movements because the presence of adequate volume validates the price movement. If a price movement fails to be validated by adequate volume , then there is going to be an equal an opposite reaction. There exists a variable that satisfies both quantitative and fundamental analysts. That is the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) and it is complemented by the Volume Weighted Moving Average ( VWMA ). When you do not consider the weight of volume in price movements, you are at the mercy of manipulative, high volume whales that seek to sink Simple Moving Averages ( SMAs ) during times of low volume in the interest of accumulation of the asset.

VWAPs can be treated as the ""true"" price of an asset on any given resolution, but become less sensitive to change as you zoom out. These ever-shifting values can be treated as floors, in bullish times, and ceilings, during a bear market. You can always expect a ""bounce"" off of the VWAP in the opposite direction at least once as price attempts to cross over it. These resistance lines are useful to every audience, the soon-to-be long holders who would like to plan a decent entry, the short sellers trying to make a quick buck, and the swing traders who like to make money regardless of who controls the market. One should always keep in mind that price never strays too far from the VWAP before attempting to violently correct itself in the other direction.

There is a measure of movement around the VWAP , which we'll call volatility , and it masks the true price of the asset and its direction. By following the VWAP , you can see accurately whether the asset is going high or low. I'm using these customized bands to look for long entries (in the green or below) and short entries (in the red or above) to make short term profits to be accumulated in my spot balances. Ultimately, by building your position you can ensure a long-term profit but it doesn't mean too much if one simply never takes profit.

Longs can be slept on. Shorts must be monitored. Set a budget, craft a plan, and stick to it. Remember to remove your principal investment at some point to reduce your risk.

In a bull market, buy at the monthly VWAP (Purple Line) and in a bear market, sell there.

Happy Hunting!- Patch Hemlock

Does no one remember what happened the week after RobinHood banned buying of GME? Seriously. There was this mass belief among those of us long on GME (and I should know, I believed in it) that SO LONG as the ticker closed above $320 on Friday, we would wake up Monday morning to the squeeze of all short squeezes.


And Monday morning in pre-market and all during the day we look at the stock, and lo and behold, the MOASS happened, and every single person who ever bought GME sold it for a price greater than $1000, and world peace was realized because the wealth had been redistributed through the markets for the first time in history.


No. It began the fall down to $40, which it finally hit towards the end of the month. Sure, it‚Äôs back above $100 per share, but that date was wrong and dangerous and a lot of people lost a lot of money.


Look, I‚Äôm long on GME. I believe there‚Äôs a possibility of a short squeeze. But the cultier the message becomes, the more ANGRY people are that other tickers are mentioned:


>RKT is just a hedge fund attempt to distract people from GME, just like SLV was.


That‚Äôs a great point, buddy. Say, have you looked at their charts? Do you understand the fundamental difference between the mortgage industry and a ticker that purports to be backed by actual silver but isn‚Äôt?


Oh, and let‚Äôs talk about the gross overestimation of WSB‚Äôs power. It is literally impossible for this subreddit to P*mp and D*mp. Every good trade, every time a ticker pops off, it is because of institutional power and pressure and market conditions. When people make money off of these things, it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre riding that train, not conducting it. No P*mp and D*mps are baked into the rules. Do you not trust u/zjz? What‚Äôs wrong with you. The market cap on tickers mentioned here has to be above a certain number to explicitly prevent p*mping and d*mping.
Don‚Äôt believe me?


Why isn‚Äôt PLTR at 50 then? No, seriously, why has it never hit $50 per share. They had a great earning last week. All over the subreddit people said it would hit $50.


In fact, if WSB is so damn important and powerful, how come GME spent almost an entire month below $60 per share in February?


Today could be a very good day. It could also be a very bad day- for whatever tickers you are invested in.


There are lots of great reasons to be long in GME outside of a potential short squeeze, and I personally think the stock is undervalued until it reaches a price of close to $200 per share, but I also think it will be incredibly volatile before that.


I also think it won‚Äôt earn that price target organically for two to three years. I think Ryan Cohen can successfully transform the company, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long on GME.


So, rather than convincing yourselves that you know everything, that it‚Äôs all going to work out in a specific way at a certain date because of THIS INFORMATION, why don‚Äôt you relish in the fact that you don‚Äôt know. Because I certainly don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know anything. I‚Äôm a fucking idiot who makes financial decisions based off of gut feelings and the things I‚Äôve read on a subreddit filled with other idiots. And that‚Äôs beautiful all on it‚Äôs own."

This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do I hate? The shorts! 

Additionally, its a great income stock! UWMC declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021. Do you like free money? I would load up on this bad boy prior to March 10th! 

There are plenty of other catalysts and reasons to long this. It is getting added to the Russell 1000 and 3000 index by the end of this month, and it will absolutely crush its earnings again this quarter. Tomorrow, contracts will be pretty expensive as IV will go thru the roof in the AM, but as of market close there were still very reasonable prices for March, April, and May (post earnings) calls.  

Look at this activity aftermarket, it is up $1.30 (\~15%)! I wouldn‚Äôt wanna be staring from the sidelines as this stock rockets like $RKT? 

\*Disclaimer\* I am Long UWMC and have calls for both April and May.  This is not financial advice I just like the stock!!

*editing to add this dumb ass pun I thought of way too late: I‚Äôd MORTGAGE the house on this one.

*editing again bc I forgot to include the ANALysts PTs if you care about those; average is $11.60, low of $10.50, and high of $13.50. All are bulls.

*edit x3 since I‚Äôm a smooth brain and didn‚Äôt include what UWMC actually does and this has gotten much more attention than I thought. UWMC is United Wholesale Mortgage Corporation! They are... as the name implies... a mortgage lender! They mainly fund mortgage loans through independent mortgage brokers. Aka they make bank off of interest... think about how much you smooth brains pay in interest and will pay in interest every month for the next 25 years of your life. You‚Äôre paying UWMC. They‚Äôve got a decent chunk of the market, and are continuing to grow."
49,üö®üö®WHY ITS NOT OVER FOR RKT üö®üö®MORE SHORTS HAVE RELOADEDüö®üö® üöÄüöÄ IMPORTANT DD INSIDE.üöÄüöÄ,2021-03-03 00:42:41,"Hoping this time I won't get immedately deleted. 3rd times the charm?

&#x200B;

SUPER TLDR: üö®üö®My PT is $73.5. üö®üö®

&#x200B;

IF you read my first DD and got in, congrats.

Check it out if you're late to the party.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the\_rkt\_is\_fueled\_and\_ready\_for\_liftoff\_launches/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the_rkt_is_fueled_and_ready_for_liftoff_launches/)

There are exactly two reasons for why its NOT FUCKING OVER.

Reason 1: Dan and Jay hate the shorts

Wall street has never considered RKT to be a Fintech company.

You know what's happening tomorrow at 10:15 AM?

[https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

That's right. Jay Farner, the CEO is going live with Morgan Stanley during a TECH conference to have a fireside chat.

You're going to tell me that they just happened to have this scheduled smack in the middle of the week of hell for RKT shorts? You're going to tell me that there's no way they might drop a bomb that truly sends RKT to the stratosphere?

I have no fucking idea. But I trust in Dan Gilbert & Co. to win. Because that's all they've done for the past 35 fucking years. WIN.

&#x200B;

To make things even sweeter, more dry powder is coming in tomorrow- market makers making new options tomorrow. Remember the first time new options came out for GME? If you bought even the farthest OTM one, it printed.

üö®üö®MM WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DELTA NETURAL WITH THEIR NEW OPTIONS üö®üö®, THUS THEY WILL HAVE TO BUY SHARES. THEREFORE, THE MORE NEW OPTIONS BOUGHT TOMORROW, THE MORE FUEL IS LOADED FOR A GAMMA SQUEEZE. üö®üö®

&#x200B;

To close things up, recall that RKT had 40% interest going into this week. Look at today's graph.

[https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l](https://imgur.com/vIgVH7l)

&#x200B;

Notice those two drops where it halted? See the STRONG support that immediately followed? This is a textbook example of a ladder attack. The SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, AT A NEW PRICE. Shorts ATTEMPTED to shake the üíéüëê , but failed. Retail is NOT ALONE on this üöÄ. The DIP is being purchased, even while at an ATH.  Someone is on the LONG side buying up shares with retail.

In my opinion, after today, short interest could potentially even end up way higher than 40%. Look at the candles during those short ladder attacks. Shorts had to have borrow MILLIONS of shares to attempt to short ladder today. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Melvin & CO's latest play to dig themselves out of their Gamestop loss porn either.

MORE SHORTING = MORE SHORTS TO CHOKE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So that's reason 1. There's a nonzero chance Jay Farner drops a bomb tomorrow that takes us to the stratosphere. But what's reason 2?

üö®üö®MY PRICE TARGET FOR RKT IS $73.5 üö®üö®

Let's go through the numbers.

&#x200B;

RKT's projected EPS for this year is \~ $2.45.

\[LINK 3\] \~ (SOURCE IS ON SA, REMOVED LINK BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING MY POST DELETED)

&#x200B;

To get P/E, take the price and divide by earnings. Thus, we can use this to calculate the forward P/E for RKT. RKT closed at $41.79, which divided by $2.45 is \~17.05. Thus, RKT currently trades at about a 17Forward P/E. Companies in this sector trade in between 15-30 P/E, and since I strongly believe RKT is a growth stock, I think it should trade at 30x P/E.

Thus, 30 x $2.45 is $73.5.

Therefore, my PT for RKT is $73.5. RKT is a fintech company, and is a PROFITABLE one. Think about how many fintech companies have crazier valuations and aren't even profitable?

You know what that means?

IT'S NOT FUCKING OVER. IF SUITS ARE BUYING AT ATH, IM BUYING AT ATH. IF SHORTS HAVE RELOADED, THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT SQUOZE. THE SUITS AGREE. RKT IS WORTH MORE THAN $40.

&#x200B;

TLDR: SHORT INTEREST HAS PROBABLY GONE UP, SUITS ARE BUYING. CURRENT P/E is 17, GROWTH PE IN MY OPINION SHOULD BE AT LEAST 30. RKT IS STILL UNDERVALUED, AND MY PRICE TARGET IS $73.5

&#x200B;

Remember, üöÄ fundamentally a great company. They are still NOT priced as a growth stock. They are still NOT considered Fintech by the suits. There is a reason why this stock closed strong at a new ATH.

I LIKE THE STOCK.

&#x200B;

üö®üö®My PT is $73.5. üö®üö®

üö®üö®50 TOMORROW üö®üö®

üö®üö®60 to 70+ EOW if the shorts bail instead of of doubling down.üö®üö®

THIS IS NOT A üßªüëêTRADE

&#x200B;

Not financial advice. I don't know anything.

Positions: 150 shares, 50 $23 C 3/5 EXP. I will be exercising almost all my calls as I am LONG.

I will be purchasing OTM calls tomorrow at open üöÄüöÄ

Currently considering some $50 and $60 strike expiring 3/5.

68,A word of caution about what‚Äôs to come,2021-03-03 02:49:21,"Before you take my order of french fries and a large frosty I wanted to tell you a story... 

I‚Äôm a long time lurker in the WSB and I have been following the GME saga since December, unfortunately I jumped in too late so I bought 4 shares at 350 on Jan 28th and I have been holding them with my life, also I kept buying more to average down.

I have the same mentally as most of people here‚Ä¶ **I believe in the company and all the changes it‚Äôs doing so, I do believe that even if the SS doesn‚Äôt happen having GME stock is an amazing investment.** 

But fear not, there is enough evidence to know that **it‚Äôs not a matter of ‚Äúif the SS happens or not, is just a matter of WHEN it‚Äôs going to happen‚Äù**

ANYWAYS‚Ä¶ what I wanted to say is, **when the MOASS happens you need to be prepared, specially, mentally prepared for the ultra bumpy ride.** 

I have the feeling that everyone here thinks that once the rocket takes off everything is going to be a smooth ride and you just need to wait for the perfect time to sell and become rich‚Ä¶ I have bad news for you, it won‚Äôt be like that.

If you think that this last weeks between HFs hiding information, media publishing shitty articles about why you shouldn‚Äôt invest in GME, a bald dude on T.V. talking crap about the stock or Reddit, all the short ladder attacks, bots, shills, lying to the Congress‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶ is crazy, just wait until this thing explodes.

**I presume most of us, or probably all of us, have seen a movie where a space ship goes through an asteroid belt?  That‚Äôs going to be our rocket, that‚Äôs going to be this forum and it‚Äôs going to be pandemonium.**

I do believe and admire the collective wisdom (this is the reason why all the DDs we have read are amazing and all of them has been improved or refuted by their peers or a bunch of apes, for what it matters is the same).

However, I do also believe in mass panic, and panic and fear are really strong emotions.

Every single person who has been playing in this casino known as stock market is aware that most of time **logic, intelligence and incredible well done DDs are thrown out the window the moment emotions like fear and greed take control**. (Just remember that people started to stockpiling toilet paper a year ago...)

Greed is what put the HF in this situation. Fear is what we lost when the stock went from almost $500 all the way down to $40‚Äôs range.

In this game, when people lose fear all that is left is greed, and it can be really powerful if we use it correctly (we can EASILY surpass the 100K) but it can be our demise as well. 

Don‚Äôt forget **it‚Äôs not the same a HF having a ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù fight trying to get out of this mess or passing the hot potato to someone else when the stock is worth only $120+ and they are losing billions than when they are cornered and the stock is passing the 1,000‚Ä¶5,000‚Ä¶.10,000.**

**In that moment is when they are going to take the gloves off and the real fight is going to start.**

So, be prepared that everything and anything can happen; and when hell broke loose all camaderry might stop and it might be every man for himself. 

And I'm not telling you to let's stay together until the end, fuck no, we are here to become rich and if we make some friends along the way, great, but if not I'll cry alone on top of my pile of money.

However, what I'm really trying to tell you is to keep emotions in check, don't be a fool thinking it's going to be a smooth ride, be as greedy as fuck (translation: hold like your life depends on it, cause it does) and please.... 

 **tl;dr:** **DON‚ÄôT PANIC AND CARRY A TOWEL.**

&#x200B;

P.S. Probably you can tell English is not my first language so‚Ä¶.**Viva M√©xico Putos**  


P.S.2. **Obligatory**: I have no clue how to put emojis from the computer so: **Me gusta la acci√≥n y manos de Diamante**"
69,The industry players again GME,2021-03-02 12:03:24,"Thought I would have a quick run through of the mid February 13F's to see who has the big positions against GME. Here is the list if anyone is interested, it covers everyone with positions over $30m. I know the majority of this has already been quantified elsewhere, but wanted to make sure (as don't like to trust information unless I see it myself). As always, this is not financial advice.

&#x200B;

>It is said that if you **know your enemies** and **know** yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not **know your enemies** but do **know** yourself, you will win one and lose one; if you do not **know your enemies** nor yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.

&#x200B;

This then lead me down the path of looking who holds big positions against EX R TEHE and some of the other ETFs that hold massive positions in GME. Surprise, it's all the same people, guess if I went down the rabbit hole of all the ETF's that hold GME it would be the same story. Thing is, even in massive ETF's like the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, some of these guys have very big positions against.

Biggest surprise to me was to see UBS and Citigroup in there. These guys definitely fit into the too big to fail category.

If you need any reason why the entire market shakes when GME goes up, just look at the market value of all positions of these organisations. What you have got remember, is that when some of these organisations unwind their positions, the ALGOS follow and it has an amplification effect. Billions of dollars of positions being unwound can amplify into the tens of Billions very easily due to HFT trying to get an edge.

You also need to remember that these positions are most likely way under what is actually there, mostly down to the fines for mis reporting being pitiful.

If you can't be bothered to look at the information below, the big bosses are Melvin, Citadel and Susquehanna (SIG). I would even go as far as to say that Susquehanna (SIG) might be the final boss. Guess what? Susquehanna also has a market making arm called G1 EXECUTION SERVICES, dirty fingers across the same pies as shitadel.

Edit: Guess who also owns 4,225,900 of puts totalling $85,448,000 and 4,196,299 of calls totalling $84,849,000  in RKT, you are right Susquehanna. Big thanks to the u/[Dadri88](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dadri88/) below for this.  Guess who else also has a big position in RKT, yep, just your friendly neighbourhood Citadel.  $59,770,000 in calls and $37,189,000 in puts. If I had a really big hedge fund, maybe I would put puts and calls on a company, push a narrative on social media and then benefit either way off of the volatility. Not in any way saying that this is what these guys are doing......

Let me share with you this line from wikipedia about Susquehanna,

&#x200B;

>Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture. The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on decision making under conditions of uncertainty. SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool. The company employs Bill Chen, a World Series of Poker star, in its quantitative trading group

It's funny that in the Washington hearings they talked about the social media on redit running up the shares prices, but failed to discus the shorters tools like The Motley FOOL putting out bogus negative press releases daily and even several times a day when the stock is railying in a deliberate effort to scare investors from buying and to induce selling to make the short sellers the represent money at investors expense.

77,A few lines about GME (please read),2021-03-02 12:45:30,"1. Price doesn't matter until the squeeze has been squoze.
2. The best time to buy GME was 2 months ago, the second best time is NOW.
3. Buy shares, not options. Invest only the money you can afford to lose.
4. Don't fall for FUD. Any account can be a shill/bot, even the ones created before January. They are PAYING users to spread fear and enroll you to post negative comments/posts.
5. GME has been and will always be the only play. Anything else is a distraction to limit the impact GME can have. (Yes, even RKT). Never will the planets align this perfectly again to trigger the biggest short squeeze of your lifetime.
6. The most important point : Don't sell. Supply and demand : you have something they want, we all do. So YOU set the price you want. And the price can actually go up to infinity. This is going to be the biggest transfer of wealth the world has ever seen, don't ruin it being a paper hand and selling low.
7. Hold. Hold. Hold. Selling at 1k is trolling. They want you to sell at 1k, that's why they keep spamming comments saying they put stop limits at 1k. 1k is lowball. 1k could just be a gamma squeeze. 10k is lowball.
8. As stated by u/Polihanna, the squeeze will last multiple days.  Don't be afraid that it lasts a few seconds and you'll miss it. You won't. 
9. Don't day-trade GME. It's extremely volatile, and you actually help them by selling shares that they can buy for cheap. You delay the squeeze and reduce its impact if you day-trade.
10. THIS IS NOT A GAME OF GREED. IT IS A GAME OF TRUST.

&#x200B;

100K/SHARE MINIMUM. (And that's only a checkpoint).

&#x200B;

Don't get caught in their FUD, they are trapped in a corner and are doing everything they can, legal or not, to limit their losses. Finish them.

Most importantly : I will not sell under 100k. This is the play of a lifetime, this could change my entire life, I could buy a house, and help others. I'm not ruining my only chance.

85,GME Thresholds (Week Ending 3/5),2021-03-03 13:02:30,"Hi all,

ADHD on medication who loves numbers and game theory here. This is not financial advice.

**TL;DR** - GME must hit 145 to level up to the next level of squeeze. 150 and 200 only make the level up stronger.

Many of you all are expecting an immediate squeeze. This will most likely not be the case. The hedge funds are smarter and will have learned their mistakes from the previous squeeze last month. Instead, they will elongate the squeeze and hope that we eventually lose interest.

**What does this mean?**

The squeeze is currently happening. As long as certain checkpoints are hit each week, the squeeze will continue to squeeze.

We saw this last week as we broke certain price thresholds. These thresholds had a ton of options ITM that results in shares that need to be bought. These bought shares pushed the stock price to its current level. Passing through thresholds each week means that the stock price will ""Level Up"" until the shorts are out.

What are the thresholds this weeks?

[As you can see here](http://puu.sh/HlNeJ/3780f377f8.png) , there are thousands of options contracts between 115 and 150. 

If we hit $145 EOW, 9930 contracts equaling 993,000 must be bought. If we hit $150, an additional 567,000 shares must be bought. If we hit 200, 681,000 more shares must be bought.

For this stock to ""Level Up"", GME needs to hit at least $145 EOW. If it hits 150 or 200, it will only accelerate the process.

Every week, the hedge funds will do whatever they can to stop the stock from hitting these thresholds. If Gamestop misses a threshold, the squeeze will be delayed. If it misses enough thresholds, the squeeze is done.

Please dissect and tell me what's wrong with my logic."

90,MORNING MATH FOR YOUR APE ASS,2021-03-03 13:00:27,"So yesterday as RKT was blasting off (congrats to those who took the ride) I was watching GME go down from people leaving for the next shiny new thing. It was a 20 point drop. Unfortunately this was just as we were about to break 134 resistance that we had for the day (besides the point)

20 points in a 69 million share company comes out to roughly $1.4 BILLION. Let's say 400 million of that was HF downward pressure at the same time. That tells me that $1 BILLION shifted out of GME for RKT. 

That's a lot of fucking money in one hours time.

Now let's say only 10% of apes paper handed for something new (a total retard guess). That leaves another 9 to 10 billion of retail money in GME. Probably a fuck ton more, but I have no evidence to back up anything I say.

So to this I say.

**Business Profile**

UWM Holdings Corporation engages in the residential mortgage lending business in the United States. The company originates mortgage loans through wholesale channel. It originates, processes, and underwrites primarily government-sponsored enterprises-conforming mortgage loans; and the Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, and the Veteran Affairs mortgage loans, which are pooled and sold in the secondary market. The company was founded in 1986 and is headquartered in Pontiac, Michigan.

To start with, UWMC's EPS has gone down and is negative according to marketwatch, not sure how updated this is but it isnt a good thing to say the least:

This isn't a good sign, but this won't matter if their is a squeeze. According to 4 analysts UWM Holdings is forecast to have 4.8% annual earnings growth and have 9.8% per year revenue growth which are both slower than the US Market's similar numbers. Meanwhile, UWMC's net profit margins are 59.7% which is higher than in 2020: 30%. Another good sign is UWMC earnings growth from this year: 545% which is higher than the Mortgage industry average of: 7%.

This is a place for more than one stock, and the rules explicitly go against any coordinated p/mp and dump. Let people enjoy their gains and talk about their moves for tomorrow without getting dogpiled by a bunch of smooth-brained twats who think anyone who doesn't fit their confirmation bias of something that still very well may not happen despite your deep desires for tendies is a bot. I was here for the first GME round, and from what I saw of the past before this all started, it was so much better than this bullshit right here and I wish the mods would do more to redirect the dumb mob mentality. It was all gung-ho after GME dropped and the bagholders suddenly saw the light and started acting normal, but some random sustained spike in price with a slight potential of an actual squeeze really whipped y'all back into the Qstonk type shit and now y'all don't know how to act right again.

Anyways, for those of you wondering I have 44.6@$37 $RKT (bought in at 29 then averaged up) but am planning on selling tomorrow at the post-open high before things tank and potentially buy back into GME or buy into UWMC.

95,Why $RKT is the catalyst to send $GME to the Moon,2021-03-03 00:54:03,"Alright, learn to read fuckers because this is gonna be a long one.

Before I get started, can you morons who are shitting all over $RKT buyers shut up? WallStreetBets is about making money, doesn't matter what play. And yes, there will be some bagholders on that one. But everyone playing it knows the risk. There's only two appropriate responses if someone tells you they bought into $RKT. 1)If they lose money, you troll them and call them a retard. 2)They make money, and you congratulate them and tell them to fuck themselves.

Now, none of you are wrong to be skeptical about the play. It does in fact seem too easy, doesn't it? Well, as noted in the below post, at LEAST two of the hedge funds we're fighting on the GME front are in on the $RKT play:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the\_industry\_players\_again\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/)

(Credit to u/Dadri88 and u/skifunkster)

But what if I told you it didn't matter that they were profiting off that play? I'm serious, it doesn't matter. Even if they personally asked the Board of Rocket to declare the special dividend, and planned to mobilize WSB in pursuit of profit (They didn't do this), we should still be lining up to kiss them. They're hanging themselves in front of our eyes. Here's why:

$GME needs a catalyst. We've known this is still a legitimate play, but most posts are in agreement. We needs whales, we need hedge funds on our side, and we need catalysts. We now have SEVERAL catalysts. In case you've forgotten, the catalysts for GME occuring this month are: Earnings, The Quadruple Witching Day, and now $RKT.

Why is $RKT a catalyst for GME? We're not quite at the finish line yet. How will we know when we're close? They'll pull out our controllers again (Limiting Buying). How do they wind up defeated if they do this? Big money on our side. $RKT will get us that money. If you're still too retarded to picture it, let me provide an example.

Imagine you're Papa Elon. You want to shoot your SpaceX Rockets to the Moon and beyond. So far, you've loaded the ships with apes and bananas, but you need some ACTUAL astronauts on board. How do you earn the trust of the real astronauts (AKA BIG MONEY)? You launch a test flight. $RKT is the SpaceX test flight, retards. It doesn't matter if you like the play, if you're in on the action, or not. You SHOULD be cheering it on.

If it works, we have proof of concept. Imagine it: A Massive short squeeze on a company where the short interest is only 30-40%. What do you think will prove our point that squeezes can be squoze, better than seeing a real live squeeze in public view? It's literally the best thing that could happen.

So, moral of the story: Sit back, shut the fuck up, and cheer those other retards on! If that play works, it will help send our own to the goddamn moon! Smile apes, and I'll see you on the Moon!

Edit: This is of course, not financial advice. I am a dumb ape, who picks his nose and eats it. I just like the stonks. And I'll HOLD!"

There must have been some terrible news right? Being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of 5, I begin researching what terrible thing happened to Costco to cause such a rapid selloff. But the more I looked the more I realized that this selloff is really just weird...and it could be an opportunity to get some tendies...(or rotisserie chickens...see what I did there?)

**Researching Possible Causes**

Could it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks? No, its only running 0.98% of shares shorted.

Was there any news of accidents or management issues? None that I could find on google.

Then I come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things

**Warren Buffet Sells his shares of Costco**

https://www dot yahoo dot com/lifestyle/warren-buffett-dumps-all-his-costco-stock-3-reasons-why-that-is-a-big-surprise-235600486.html

Well, considering that he sold it off prior to November 16th 2020 (could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov 9-10th?) shouldn't the stock have begun to drop from there? It should have, but it didn't. So I looked some more and found that Costco announced a special $10 dividend (which is pretty high...I mean RKT announced a $1.11 div and thought that was amazing). My first thought was that damn, Costco made a lot of money to do a $10 dividend, and second, that this drop isn't justified if Costco is making a ton of money.

https://finance dot yahoo dot com/news/supermarket-chain-costco-declares-special-222312149.html

Here's a chart with the dividend marked (you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet?).

As you can see, right after the dividend has passed, the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end, and with that $10 dividend in the back of my head, im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason.

So I do some due diligence and look at the financials, earning calls, etc. I then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price. They seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k9hpvqcjerk61.png?width=998&format=png&auto=webp&s=830afac11cd00a1ba28c1822105e29a3b5ae78c3

Each blue horizontal line marks an earnings call, where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards. Each call is followed by a swing of about 10 points up or 10 points down. Typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds. This confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of Costco, there really isn't any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further (or remain the same).

&#x200B;

As you can see, the stock is just completely oversold, trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife (you know, buy the dip)...but what could slow the downfall and even reverse it?

**Enter the earnings call March 4th and why I am Bullish**

Looking through the financials, Costco has continuously beat its earnings.

>This warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 11.04%.  
>  
>For the most recent quarter, Costco was expected to post earnings of $2.04 per share, but it reported $2.29 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.25%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.85 per share, while it actually produced $3.13 per share, a surprise of 9.82%.

https://news dot yahoo dot com/costco-cost-beat-estimates-again-171005710.html

And looking at its previous 2 years of March earnings, it has always beat its December earnings (for all you call options people). I didn't do a screen capture as its a long scroll. But the data is on the link below. Just look at all the March earnings vs the one reported before it.

**Fundamentals (if they matter anymore) have not changed, AND WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.**

**They make a ton of money (selling tendies):**

>In FY 2020, ended August 30, 2020, Costco posted year-over-year (YOY) gains in revenue, net income, and other metrics. Total revenue increased by 9.2% YOY while net income attributable to Costco climbed by 9.4% YOY.3Ôªø The company said that its e-commerce business saw a 50% YOY increase in sales for FY 2020 as a result of gains in grocery deliveries, prescription medications, electronics, and office supplies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.4Ôªø  
>  
>Costco posted revenue of $43.2 billion and net income attributable to Costco of $1.2 billion in its Q1 FY 2021, ended November 22, 2020. Revenue rose 16.7% while net income attributable to Costco grew 38.2% compared to Q1 FY 2020.

**They are growing their online business (growing and selling rotisserie chickens):**

Continuing its sales strength during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company reported net sales across all segments of $19.1 billion for the five-week period ending January 3, 2021, a 12.3% YOY improvement overall as e-commerce sales jumped 62.5%.

**They are international (also making tendies):**

>Besides the U.S. and Canada, Costco operates membership warehouses in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Spain, Australia, France, China, and Iceland, and these latter countries are represented in the Other International Operations segment. Together, the non-U.S. and non-Canadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the company's Canadian business. For Q1 FY 2021, Other International Operations generated total revenue of about $5.9 billion, a 21.8% YOY increase. Other International Operations also posted Q1 FY 2021 operating income of $289 million, a 46.0% YOY increase. This makes this segment the fastest-growing in terms of both total revenue and operating income. It comprises 13.7% of revenue and 20.2% of operating income.

https://www dot investopedia dot com/how-costco-makes-money-5094774

**Why Costco post pandemic will still retain its customers (Article from 2020):**

>Nearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so. A full 91% of its U.S. shopper base chose to renew, in fact, which marks a slight increase from the 90.9% that Costco reported in each of the last three quarters. Costco counted 55.8 million member households at the end of Q3, up 500,000 compared to the prior quarter. Its global renewal rate was unchanged at 88.4%.

https://www dot fool dot com/investing/2020/06/01/why-almost-no-one-canceling-costco-membership.aspx

Costco is a solid business with much upside. Despite buffet selling (he also dumped AAPL), the fundamentals of the business have not changed. Seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself, and that most people do not cancel their memberships, I dont see why Costco would suffer post covid. At the recent price its currently at, it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction.

**My Plan:**

I like this stock for both a long hold, and will supplement with $340 March 19th (sound familiar?) Calls. Ill have 60 shares come market open tomorrow.

edit: fat fingered march 5th instead of march 4th earnings call."

106,DD: Nokia,2021-03-03 11:06:11," Nokia's Networks Margin Situation:  


In 2021, networks division is projected to have 0% profit margin.  
In 2020, Nokia's networks division had higher than imagined margins due to product cost reductions as ReefShark shipments of 43% was well above the targeted 35%. This resulted in an excellent earnings report.  
The type of results Nokia achieved in 2020 should have caused the stock to soar but it didn't as the Verizon loss was very significant for Nokia and it will cause a ""challanging 2021"" per Pekka Lundmark.  


Having said that, if in 2021, the 70% ReefShark shipment goal is exceeded, it would be a giant step towards having better than 0% margins. There will be top and bottom line pressures due to Verizon loss and increased R&D spending. However, each 1 percent point increase in Networks margin means about 100 million Euros in pure profit (directly goes to the bottom line since expenses are largely fixed). Each additional profit margin increment means higher EPS which has almost perfect correlation with the share price.  


Networks division has the following customer types:  
CSPs (such as Verizon): 18 billion Euros  
Enterprise: 1.6 billion Euros  
Licensees: 1.4 billion Euros  
Other (ASN and RFS): 861 million Euros  


The unfortunate situation we are in is the CSP revenues are going down. Since, North America is a favorable region for margins, Verizon loss will cause a higher damage to Nokia's profitability than say if they lost a Latin American customer.  
YoY constant currency revenue change for the CSP subset is -5%. Since this is the biggest subset of Nokia, it is obviously causing all the problems we are facing today.  


However, the big opportunity here is the Enterprise market. It is relatively small as of 2020. However, within just a few months, if my memory serves me right, Nokia increased its Enterprise customers from 70 to 260 (probably a lot more now. We'll see in Q1 2021 earnings report. I am very interested in this number as it might not only negate the CSP concerns for the upcoming years, but it might become a giant revenue and margin provider for Nokia.)  


[https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/07/21/nokia-announces-first-commercial-5g-standalone-sa-private-wireless-networking-solutions-for-enterprise-customers/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/07/21/nokia-announces-first-commercial-5g-standalone-sa-private-wireless-networking-solutions-for-enterprise-customers/)  


[https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-future-of-enterprise/](https://www.nokia.com/blog/the-future-of-enterprise/)  


As of 2020, Enterprise subset revenue is only 1.6 billion Euros. HOWEVER, it is growing at 14% in constant currency YoY. Since, Enterprise market is newly developing, and per Pekka Lundmark, Nokia is a leader, this subset could objectively become the driver for Nokia to reach $20 and beyond.  


Do me a favor and google private 5G/Enterprise market growth projections or take a look at this article.  . [https://www.statista.com/chart/9604/5g-subscription-forecast/](https://www.statista.com/chart/9604/5g-subscription-forecast/)  You will see that the 14% annual growth is VERY conservative. This opportunity here for us shareholders is not pure positivity, lying, deceiving or some unachievable dream but is a reality as it is happening right NOW. Not in 2-3 years, not in 5 years but right now.  


Also, the bigger opportunity with the Enterprise market is not only the revenues will soar year after year but that the profit margins are much better than the global CSP market per Pekka Lundmark. As we know the profits directly effect EPS and EPS directly effects the share price.  


Having said that, I think 2021 will still be challanging due to the Verizon loss as it was a GIANT loss. It is really hard to make up for that loss in less than a year. However, the near future objectively looks bright. The million dollar question is how quickly will Nokia negate the Verizon loss and how quickly will the Enterprise subset become very significant. Based on a conservative 15% growth rate, this subset will bring in 1.8 billion Euros and a minimum of about 180 million Euros in 2021. IF Nokia exceeds these expectations, I would become even more bullish than $20 per share. Don't forget, Nokia is projecting to be breakeven in the networks division only for 2021. Afterwards, Nokia says it will significantly improve the margins. If Nokia gets somewhat close to what Ericsson is achieving in PMs, it will have around 12-15% in networks margin. That will bring in 1-1.5 billion Euros in additional profits per year. That would alone cause the stock price to at least triple from its current price.  


The truth is, there are risks in the short term. The stock might go down to low $3 range after March 18th if Pekka Lundmark gives a poor forward guidance. However, the potential is there and it is in motion right now. It is not a pipe dream. Unless Pekka Lundmark talks negatively about the Enterprise markets future, I am here to stay.  


Nokia stock in my opinion has probably one of the best risk reward ratios in the market right now."

109,Thinking about buying puts on DoorDash? ($DASH),2021-03-03 14:27:05,"I know we like to say ""I like the stock"" around here. But in the case of Doordash, I just really hate this stock.

I've seen other DD on here about this play but here's a quick rundown:

* It's trading at about 20x sales
* High competition market (GrubHub, Uber Eats, Postmates, Waitr, Bite Squad, etc.)
* Coming off of a great sales year because people were stuck at home and forced to use their product, growth is already expected to slow going forward.
* IPO Lockup expiring March 9th which will free up about 40% of existing shares.

The only people who I can find who are bullish on this name are either bagholders or the IPO underwriters. With that being said, I wanted to buy a $170 put when this was at $200 last week but I pussed out because the premiums looked high and there was a wide bid-ask spread. Now it's at about $160 and I'm looking at either the $150 or $155 put for March 19. I believe another 7% drop is absolutely attainable between now and then. Look at how Palantir tanked after their lockup expiration, and that's a revolutionary tech company with hugely bullish backers (Cathie)

This would be my first time buying puts, so I wanted to run the idea through here to make sure there was still upside for this play, as we're getting closer to the expiry date. If anyone has any other ideas for strikes and prices feel free to share!

No positions in $DASH currently but I will update if I do jump in today

EDIT: Just dipped my toe in with one DASH 3/19 $140P. Still looking at adding more at different strikes as we move closer to lockup expiry."

111,Why $RKT is the catalyst to send $GME to the Moon,2021-03-03 00:54:03,"Alright, learn to read fuckers because this is gonna be a long one.

Before I get started, can you morons who are shitting all over $RKT buyers shut up? WallStreetBets is about making money, doesn't matter what play. And yes, there will be some bagholders on that one. But everyone playing it knows the risk. There's only two appropriate responses if someone tells you they bought into $RKT. 1)If they lose money, you troll them and call them a retard. 2)They make money, and you congratulate them and tell them to fuck themselves.

Now, none of you are wrong to be skeptical about the play. It does in fact seem too easy, doesn't it? Well, as noted in the below post, at LEAST two of the hedge funds we're fighting on the GME front are in on the $RKT play:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the\_industry\_players\_again\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw0g1g/the_industry_players_again_gme/)

(Credit to u/Dadri88 and u/skifunkster)

But what if I told you it didn't matter that they were profiting off that play? I'm serious, it doesn't matter. Even if they personally asked the Board of Rocket to declare the special dividend, and planned to mobilize WSB in pursuit of profit (They didn't do this), we should still be lining up to kiss them. They're hanging themselves in front of our eyes. Here's why:

$GME needs a catalyst. We've known this is still a legitimate play, but most posts are in agreement. We needs whales, we need hedge funds on our side, and we need catalysts. We now have SEVERAL catalysts. In case you've forgotten, the catalysts for GME occuring this month are: Earnings, The Quadruple Witching Day, and now $RKT.

Why is $RKT a catalyst for GME? We're not quite at the finish line yet. How will we know when we're close? They'll pull out our controllers again (Limiting Buying). How do they wind up defeated if they do this? Big money on our side. $RKT will get us that money. If you're still too retarded to picture it, let me provide an example.

Imagine you're Papa Elon. You want to shoot your SpaceX Rockets to the Moon and beyond. So far, you've loaded the ships with apes and bananas, but you need some ACTUAL astronauts on board. How do you earn the trust of the real astronauts (AKA BIG MONEY)? You launch a test flight. $RKT is the SpaceX test flight, retards. It doesn't matter if you like the play, if you're in on the action, or not. You SHOULD be cheering it on.

If it works, we have proof of concept. Imagine it: A Massive short squeeze on a company where the short interest is only 30-40%. What do you think will prove our point that squeezes can be squoze, better than seeing a real live squeeze in public view? It's literally the best thing that could happen.

So, moral of the story: Sit back, shut the fuck up, and cheer those other retards on! If that play works, it will help send our own to the goddamn moon! Smile apes, and I'll see you on the Moon!

Edit: This is of course, not financial advice. I am a dumb ape, who picks his nose and eats it. I just like the stonks. And I'll HOLD!"

* **PURPLE just Partnered with rooms 2 go. I haven't seen a press release on this but this is big news. My understanding is that this has 200 or so locations and they are one of the most aggressive mattress sellers in the nation.**
* **Anecdotal comments from people in the industry say purple is similar to tempur-pedic in the way people ask about and know the branding. People on reddit from Denver Mattress, Mattress firm and Raymour Flannigan have all messaged me on Reddit to say purple is a good product with excellent branding.**

# What are the headlines going to say?

* In the past, headlines have been terrible but numbers have been good, due to some accounting accruals that nearly always worked against us. In Q4 all of the warrant accruals dissappeared because the warrants causing the accruals were redeemed.
* I am expecting GAAP earnings to be really really good and the automated headlines to be extremely favorable. u/lurkingsince2006 and u/indonesian_activist went back and forth last time and there were lots of unknowns, I believe this time they can both agree the warrant accrual is going to be massively favorable from a GAAP standpoint. The adjusted earnings will be the wild card. I still expect these to be good and I'm hoping for 20-30 cents per share.
   * **I expect the reversal will be around 50M+ but I would like the two Math guys mentioned above to confirm.**
* Analysts recently upgraded PRPL's earnings per share to 1.20+ for 2021. That is a big deal as all previous estimates that I recall were negative for 2-3 years to come. This is the inflection point of profitability.

# Continued Growth and future outlook

* We are likely finally going to have years of profitability going forward. Joe Megibow indicated 2021 was going to be a year of 12.5%-15% Net earnings.
* I am optimistic that Joe comments on the new factory opening
* I am optimistic that guidance will be around 875M and I am confident that they can beat that.
   * Each machine is capable of \~100M of revenue and they will likely have 9 running by Aprilish.
* Craig Phillips and Joe have already commented that PRPL will be looking for their 3rd factory towards the end of 2021 and Factory 2 would be fully built out by late 2021, early 2022.
* 2022 starting capacity will likely be 1.1B+ based on 2021 machines
* Purple hasn't even begun expanding outside of the USA, save for 300 canadian stores that were expanded in late 2020.
* I am hoping we get some sort of long term outlook, maybe something along the lines of sustained 30%+ growth for 3-5 years.

# The Timing of the call is Bullish

* This is purples second time ever having the call pre market, the first time was when they upgraded their 2019 guidance. I could be over analyzing this.... so take it with a grain of salt.
* All automated estimates assumed the call would be March 10th, Purple has pulled that in by 1 week.

# The Risks

* I am not an accountant and the last call had some weird Tax receivable agreement- u/indonesian_activist understands it better. I have not been able to find a lot of info on this.
   * If he gets this I'd like his take.
* The Macro environment..... No explanation needed here
* The lack of guidance- this is what has killed us on the last couple of calls. Silence is terrible.
* I've been wrong about Purple before. See the great NRPLING of 2020...
* Q4 is promotional in nature, so their Gross Margins may have seen pressure. I believe this is a risk. 
* Web traffic has decreased the last 40 days, I am not sure why, I'm hoping it's because they are flexing into more wholesalt.

# The plays(Conservative) - Sell puts, Debit Spreads and shares.

This is my current moves, I don't expect you guys to follow. This is just my gut feeling on PRPL. This isn't going to double overnight but it could move 15% or more either way.

If you followed the previous plays and don't feel comfortable going into earnings then now is the time to leave. If you don't mind holding some shares in the event of a miss, then join me on this adventure.

So I‚Äôve been beating myself up all morning. 

Today, I‚Äôve been back at browsing the posts trying to read as much DD as I can on different things and I keep stumbling across this UWMC. The information is so scattered that I don‚Äôt know what to think.

Last month we watched GME as well as a few other stocks go üöÄüöÄüöÄand it brought a lot of attention. After that the mods got taken over by greedy old dormant mods who jerk off to Melvin fucking his wife. u/zjz got booted for calling out the Melvin fuck buddy mods, as well as majority of our great mod team.

Luckily Reddit management was willing to address it which was big on their part and a lot of the mod team has been brought back. That being said, the strain on our mods and their bots being reconfigured, replaced, and abandoned slows down the abilities of the team. Not to mention the fact that as this sub grows and overwhelms Reddit‚Äôs servers, will force the need to change how they moderate the sub (like limiting waste  so we don‚Äôt have another website crash like last week during GME 2.0 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ).

133,How to find the Next thing (foreal),2021-03-03 02:00:43,"**Step 1:** switch that ""hot"" button to sort by ""new""

**Step 2:** ignore all things that say GME,  or RKT, or whatever the next big thing is at that time

**step 3:** look at all other tickers, if they are related to GME or RKT rather then just dd in any way (mortgage company like rkt, heavily shorted for gme) ignore it they're likely just after the hype caused by the rush.

**Step 4**: You've found a stock, coo, now look at its financials what's its share holders equity what's its net income? what's its market value? and how much do you weigh each of these? that's a personal thing, a lot of people have taken the stance that fundamentals are useless now siting TSLA and the like but that's still the easiest way to sort through the shit if you ask me.

**Step 5:** look for news, what's the sentiment? what are the aims its going for and when is this going to be revealed? you want something that has a clear way to burst through the market OTHER THEN EARNINGS, earnings are nice but it needs a clear cut reason it should go off. RKT's PE ratio was insanely good for its sector and what it was making giving it a clear cut above the rest.

**Step 6:** buy in with a A PORTION of your money into a call/put/stock based on your own taste. the more your in the market, the more you'll understand what your looking for better. i personally like to aim for previous lows within a bullish run.

**Step 7: Profit? lmao probably not**, i said to use a portion cause everything i said can help give you a better shot but lets be real here, **your using a sub who calls each other autists and retards, that recently got swamped with people who have no real stock knowledge,  when we were already struggling in the knowledge department before hand lmao. GL, your fucked either way**

Edit: A lot of people are putting ""I followed this and found xxx stock"" and let me tell you i hate most of their financials, JS, yall got some shitty understandings of step 4-5.

Also I got it I don't grammar/spell, what were you expecting? i put ""coo"" in step 4. I've been in this sub for years of course I'm retarded"

135,"UWMC DD - A swing play, value play, and long term hold rolled into one.",2021-03-02 22:27:35,"My first DD. There are a number of upcoming catalysts for UWMC, as well as positive sentiment about long term prospects. Figured I would help provide snippets of info for people just now hearing about the company. 

- March 22, UWMC will be included in the Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 indices. This was announced this morning. These inclusions always mark a price increase. Furthermore, there is potential for this to be added to the S&amp;amp;P 500. 

More info on a possible index squeeze here: https://yetanothervalueblog.com/2021/01/quickie-idea-uwmc-squeezing-higher-post-despacing.html

- March 9 is the Ex-div date. May see a small run up. The company also stated that it may provide a special dividend in the future, like RKT is doing. Even more potential profits/price increase if that happens. 

- Pretty good 0.4 dividend over the course of the year. 

- Analyst EOY ratings range from $10.50 to $14. Average is $12.33. All are bullish. 

https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/do-analysts-agree-tuesday-on-uwm-holdings-corp-uwmc-stocks-target-price

- 13% of float is shorted. This is high. There has been much less squeezing here then in RKT. More room to run.

- UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to RKT, which is expected to see a large drop. 

- Interest rate fears are overblown, and the fed continues to reiterate this fact. However, if rates do go up, UWMC is projected to hold up much better than RKT. Their business model does not rely on refinancing to the extent that RKT does.

- Trades at a much lower P/E than RKT, and has done so for months. 

- Is still trading far below previous valuations, without any real reason for dropping down so low. This drop happened after blowout earnings, on interest/housing market fears. I believe the stock was also pushed down intentionally to allow for accumulation before index additions that wouldn‚Äôt allow the stock to drop so low again. 

This is a good company that should see growth beyond current valuation. I don‚Äôt think RKT presents the same opportunity after today. There are some bear cases to be made, especially regarding the large float and possible interest rises, but I don‚Äôt see these concerns as significant right now. And I want to keep this DD short. 

My position: 1402 shares at $7.79 average. Screenshot can be found in my last YOLO post.

Edit: I see a lot of new people commenting and I don‚Äôt want anyone to get burnt. I was extremely bullish at $8-9, but with the fast price action, I‚Äôm unsure what happens over the next few days. There is some short squeeze behavior going on now. Things could go either way in the short term, but I think things will settle over the next week or two and then see a slow rise around index inclusion date."

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***TLDRish**

The theory: Get on your tin foil hats.I think 'someone' or many 'somepeoples' have discovered the incredible power of near-term options and their influence on the upward volatility on price.

As more options are bought near-the-money it causes a delta spike as market makers buy shares to hedge. This normally isn't enough to do much- but add in some magical ingredients including but not limited to: highly volatile stocks, heavy retail interest, significant short interest, a small float, inclusion in ETFs, INDEX FUNDS and other FUNDS.

As the price rises close to the strike price we also see some gamma spiking. Personally I think we saw delta hedging yesterday on Blackberry. Huge volumes around 11am.

So, PEOPLE, have discovered that just buying these heavy options, especially around volatile times, can influence the price likely more dollar-for-dollar than just buying the stock. It might be that many WSBers are literally in the right place at the right time.

**What does it all mean?** Hang onto your bananas. This thing is bigger than us. If the prices on some of these stocks rise they will need to be re-calibrated for weight for inclusion in their index funds. This creates a lot of buying and selling which exasperates the volatility further. The more volatility the more market makers have to hedge.

I think we are in for a once in a life time historical volatile ride. If you hold stock, you can ride it out and better time it. If you hold options you are really hoping your timing works well.

Something BIG is going to happen leading up to March 19th and the way the call contracts are organized creates a kind of series of landmines just waiting to be tripped. Each mine sends the price further and more volatile. What's more interesting is these stocks all seem to be related in a basket by the algo-computers. This does mean there is some degree of echo where what happens in AMC affects BB for instance. It might mean we see some double feedback happening as well. We did see it originally in January (and no one has been able to explain exactly WHY yet). I think January was a test... A proof of concept. The real prize is March 19th.

**GOOD LUCK...**

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. This is for informational and entertainment purposes only. The thoughts herein are my own. Do your own research. Do something nice for someone today.

Positions: I have some BB, NOK, calls and want to pick up some RKT calls and YOLO today. They're way up pre-market and looks like it's going to be expensive... but I particularly like this one due to the high insider ownership, stagnant pricing, low float, reasonable price volatility. This ones just primed.

**OOF, just cheeked $PLTR March 19th and it's massive too.**

A lot of moon landings coming!

On a last thought... What if GME is the catalyst for the next major crash by it's revealing of naked-shorts and fails to deliver? 2008 was all about Wall Street greed with mortgage backed securities... 2021 could be all about naked shorting and naked options writing... All meaning wall street has done it again by absorbing insane amounts of risk pursuing profits. This might all come to a head and create some systemic change that will benefit all. Damn, I'm feeling rather noble now about my own pursuits."

I provided the link above for historical context. We should see significant bounce if this is the case. I think the Fed has been doing it along, but to publicly announce that they will do so in a more aggressive manor should provide a good back drop to the market.

AMD - Just released the new Threadripper. Also underpriced and same short interest at TSLA. Could make a 10% run at any given moment.

Has every sorority girl, Becky and Soccer mom stopped wearing these because the pandemic is over? Are their stores reopening as the virus is contained?

AAPL - No brainer here. Selloff on ER for no reason has been pinned down since. This is one of the best buy and holds at this price.

143,GME - INDICATORS SHOWING ARTIFICIAL PRICE DROP BEFORE CLOSE,2021-03-03 02:13:44,"&#x200B;

[GME 15m Chart at close 2021-03-02](https://preview.redd.it/7urunolaypk61.png?width=1535&format=png&auto=webp&s=85e0be9c945f9725ff4a34d48658f03dc59cf137)

As it was brought to our attention in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lweje6/keep_your_eyes_on_the_volume_behind_the_movement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (fantastic analysis) the price drop near the end of trading today is not reflective of the volume. So by using the VWMA (Yellow - Volume weighted moving avg) and VWAP (Blue - Volume weighed avg price - this is intraday) we can see where the volume expects the price to be. Essentially, these indicators can identify a sort of ""true"" price for the stock, where the market wills it to be. Since these follow an avg. they are not reactive to volatility in the same way the active trade price is. In other words, **price at close today was artificial** to some extent, a result of wild volatility or whatever else. Particularly important is price below VWMA since this covers 20 periods rather than VWAP which is strictly session (intraday). Price below both is still a good sign.

&#x200B;

TL:DR This is a bullish signal. Price < VWMA & VWAP = Correction towards those indicators.

**Meaning if we closed today where volume expected the price to be, and where it will likely correct to - $124 . A $4 and 3.32% gain on the day at close**

Not financial advice, just having fun

&#x200B;

Edit: since it seems relevant, I don't mean artificial in a literal sense. All I'm trying to show is that these indicators are bullish because typically price corrects back to those lines."

SNDL came out at $13.01 in August 2019 and swiftly dropped down to under a dollar.

The company has a strong supply chain and is one of the best positioned to take on the demand from a national legalization, which will happen eventually. 

On top of that, the CEO said months ago that they would be expecting significant growth that would be represented in the Q1 2021 earnings report. They are announcing 2020 financial results on March 17th and then holding a conference call / webcast the following day.

156,I think IGO Limited (ASX:IGO) has an undervalued position as a lithium mining play for the inevitable EV revolution - High Level DD,2021-03-03 14:40:49,"Felt compelled to start a discussion given I can‚Äôt find any mainstream analysis regarding what I think has to be one of the stronger lithium plays to make.

Everyone knows the big dogs in the lithium space, Albemarle (ALB), SQM, Ganfeng etc. and even the smaller speculative players. However it seems there is one mining company that‚Äôs flown under the radar and quietly secured itself a piece of what I think will be one of the most important lithium mines in the world. Let me tell you about IGO limited (ASX:IGO) and the deal they made to cut into Greenbushes.

Greenbushes mine (Located in Western Australia) is operated by Talison Lithium, a joint venture by Tianqi (controlling share) and Albemarle. Tianqi bought some shares in SQM at the height of the last lithium boom, but since then prices have fallen flat and Tianqi is fucked with debt. They needed a lifeline, and in December 2020 IGO was happy to help and secure a piece of the lithium powered future. For about 1.3 billion, they secured part of a very valuable asset, let me explain below.

Greenbushes mine utilizes the hard rock method of lithium mining, and (depending on who you ask) is the largest such mine on earth. Raw spodumene is mined that is then processed to lithium carbonate. From there it can be refined into lithium hydroxide, the most sought after lithium-based component for EV batteries.

That is one method of mining lithium.

The other way is via brining. Brining is the way they do it in the lithium triangle of South America, which is where most of the mainstream attention on lithium mining is placed. However, I think that when the supply crunch comes, brine mining will be be disfavored by EV and battery manufacturers. Let me explain below:

Hard rock vs brine:

Hard Rock has a lower production cost but a lower output yield. It is relatively immune from the effects of inclement weather. It does not require massive amounts of water, and it‚Äôs environmental costs are relatively pedestrian (compared to brining)

Brine Mining has a higher production cost but a higher output. However, it is affected by inclement weather (likely to become a problem over the next 10 years imo), requires massive amounts of water, and has some pretty steep environmental and political risks
[source ](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact). Given the large amount of water required in the brining process and the political effect it has on local and indigenous peoples, I don‚Äôt think it is viable in the green future. EV and battery makers will feel pressure (and may even face regulation) that their supply chain is carbon neutral, green etc. When you consider why the EV revolution is happening, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to buy lithium from a source that requires massive amounts of fresh water, a resource that is sure to come under more scrutiny in the next 15 years. There is a possibility that innovation could fix the environmental concerns with brining, but personally, I don‚Äôt know if that is likely to happen before the supply crunch that is expected by ~2025.

Now the key $$$ fact is that when a hard rock mine‚Äôs lithium carbonate is processed into lithium hydroxide, it is the HIGHEST margin product in the lithium trade. Can‚Äôt post the graphic but it‚Äôs in this source, along with other great info [source](https://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/Lithium-brine-vs-hard-rock-demo-confirmation-MJ-ad.html) Brining can also yield Lithium hydroxide, but it requires an extra step and extra cost in the process to do so.

So, now we know that a hard rock mine that produces lithium hydroxide provides the highest margin product available. Greenbushes mine has the benefit of a lithium hydroxide refinery vertically integrated into its production cycle. The plant is called Kwianna and was solely owned by Tianqi. Until IGO came in.

For 1.3 Billion, IGO secured 24.99% stake in greenbushes mine and 49% of Kwianna lithium hydroxide plant. What‚Äôs interesting is that Ablemarle tried to buyout Tianqi of its greenbushes share in the summer of 2020. From my POV, this is indicative of how valuable greenbushes is. Thankfully, the IGO-Tianqi deal was structured in a way that, per ABL spokesman, didn‚Äôt trigger the right of first refusal clause. Speculation is that China was loathe to let an asset fall in complete control of a rival giant, which makes me think that if Tianqis financial troubles continue, IGO could be in a prime spot to secure an additional stake in greenbushes and Kwianna.

tl;dr Brine mining has credible downsides that I believe are being overlooked, which could make hard rock miners more desirable by EV/battery manufacturers as more attention is placed on their supply chains and the supply crunch comes to fruition. Greenbushes is the largest hard rock mine in the world and (I believe) one of the few that has a lithium hydroxide plant vertically integrated. IGO is in a unique position having bought into a mine with operations already up and running - 25% of the mine and 50% of the refinery. It is almost completely absent from all lithium mining discussion by mainstream outlets, and I don‚Äôt understand why that is.

Relatively new to investing and posting, so if there is a reason that IGO isn‚Äôt a worthwhile play please enlighten me.

Position: holding long 550 shares @ $5.41 USD and buying more when I can. Can‚Äôt post the OTC ticker as I don‚Äôt want this post to get removed, PM me if you want it.

162,A quick note on adding a little extra fuel to the fire for battling short sellers.,2021-03-03 18:05:07,"Good Morning Everyone.

Even with the evidence of synthetic shorts being a primary driver for the downward pressure we are seeing on certain stocks, I felt it was worth mentioning that if your account has margin on it, tucked away inside the terms of having margin it states that your shares can be used to lend to short sellers. This can happen regardless of you borrowing on margin or not. If you buy your shares in a margin account you are providing additional shares to be sold short (ammo to the enemy, if you will), which gives more leverage to the downward pressure we're fighting.

If you already own long shares in a margin account and you want to keep these shares from being lent out to short sellers, you can reach out to your broker and request that they be either moved to a cash brokerage account, or confirm that they are being held in ""Type 1"" / cash status.

Maybe this is a moot point, but I felt it was worth sharing for those not familiar the terms of margin accounts. I'll list a couple of customer account agreements and margin agreements from popular brokerage firms where it states your shares can be used to sell short in the comments."

\+Earnings are trending up - potentially positive EPS this year is not impossible and would blow out all expectations. 

\+Transocean has newly patented HALO GUARD technology and will install it on multiple rigs; they have already tested the technology on one Gulf of Mexico rig with a proven positive impact on their operations.

>As evidence of our dedication to innovation, we recently announced our patented Halo Guard technology's successful deployment on the Gulf of Mexico's Deepwater Conqueror. Halo Guard works through a combination of locating device technologies worn by personnel on the drill floor and a machine vision system using leading-edge techniques and machine learning and perception.  
>  
>As a crew member moves around the drill floor, the technology locates, tracks and alerts the individual to equipment moving in their area and can halt moving equipment, further enhancing the safety of our crew members and overall operations.  
>  
>The ability for drilling equipment to identify and respond without human prompting is something we have not seen before. We are pleased to provide our crews with additional tools and resources to complement our industry-leading training and safety programs.  
>  
>This technology adds a layer of protection for our crews, and we believe other industry participants and potentially other industries will also want to consider incorporating this technology into their operations going forward. We are currently planning to install this technology on six additional floaters this year.

\+Transocean has plenty of cash and a backlog of contracts to keep them sustainable well into the future. 

\+Oil prices still have plenty of room to run up with reopening plans - stimulus checks and vaccines are coming. 

\+The Biden administration is unlikely to be approving new pipelines that could have offset the increased demand. 

\+Very undervalued compared to historical, currently market correcting with plenty of room on the upside.

\+The reorganization of debt triggered hedge funds to push them into default. There was a court proceeding that dragged on, and the stock went down to $0.65 but eventually ruled favorably for Transocean.

\+HF was likely long the debt, short the stock, and had CDS if they could win the lawsuit.

\+The downward pressure from the shorting coupled with the lawsuit held the stock low.

\+RIG won the suit, and they were not in default.

\+Bankruptcy was priced in for $RIG; it fell as low as $0.65 from $7-14, but the market was wrong, and Bankruptcy is no longer in the forecast as they have stabilized cash flow and have reorganized their debt, pushing it out over a longer time horizon. 

\+HF may be trying to appeal the suit.

\+Transocean is THE LARGEST offshore drilling rig contractor in the world.

\+Transocean has a favorable deepwater rig count and a lack of competitors.

\+Transocean is currently delivering its best overall operational performance in its history.

\+2020 recordable incident rate was 0.24, the 2nd lowest in the history of the company, with 0 lost time incidents

\+Currently delivering 97% uptime on its global fleet, which is the highest in their history, on their most challenging fleet of floaters (ultra-deepwater and harsh environment)

\+Handling of COVID-19 was phenomenal - seamlessly transitioned teams into remote

\+Backlog is @ 7.8B, which will be converted to revenue and ultimately cash

\+New contracts are being secured in Norway starting in Q2 through EOY.

\+Other contracts in Norway extended through EOY.

\+UK contracts extended through Q3.

\+Gulf of Mexico contract with BHP option executed as an increased day rate of $215,000/day, extended through the summer.

\+Asgard (their most advanced asset) recently completed its campaign and is being bid for multiple opportunities.

\+Trinidad contract with Shell extended by one well.

\+New Trinidad contract with BHP signed for $220,000-250,000/day, ending August with Options into Fall.

\+Brazil contracts options executed for 680-day and 815-day extensions; rigs will be working through Summer 2023.

\+Indian contract option exercised for 7 wells through Q4 2022.

\+Petronas in Malaysia terminated a contract for Deepwater Nautilus in November 2020, initially set for March 2021. Litigation will likely rule in favor of Transocean.

\+Deepwater Nautilus signed a new contract that starts operations in March.

\+Expected day rates to rise YoY, with High 200ks expected soon and scaling up each year. More substantial earnings than expected are likely.

\+Reflation trade will likely push the price upwards a few dollars"

167,AMC Prediction: March 5-March 11 Huge Gains,2021-03-03 00:49:41,"# Let's start a little about AMC [Last Year Especially]

AMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives.

Now over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \[steadily\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.

Early last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low.

So to sum up why it was low last year.

&#x200B;

* Streaming services being used more
* Cinemas closed due to Covid.
* No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]
* Bankruptcy possibility
* Free reign hedge fund short selling
* No one buying the stock

# Now this year is different

We all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.

# Overvalued or Undervalued?

For the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.

&#x200B;

* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for personal use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.
* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.
* ~~No vaccine in sight \[uncertainty for its future\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson & Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.
* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.
* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \[if not most\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.
* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back now by hedge funds.

Now I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.

# Now Lets Talk About March

&#x200B;

* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.

[Notice March is at a peak or leads to peak in every year except Covid year 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)

&#x200B;

* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares

&#x200B;

# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.

A lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different.

&#x200B;

* March 5th \[this Friday\] theaters will reopen in NY \[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.

[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)

&#x200B;

* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \[my belief it is\] this will drive the price up farther.

https://preview.redd.it/ecj12fvpjpk61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e7d0fd12cedcab1659dbd3dc1ca69210adad2d

* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)

Not only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)

*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating that Amazon or Netflix may buy AMC and this day could be the announcement date. It is entirely possible AMC would come up with some good news even if this were not the case for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*

&#x200B;

* Texas will lift all Covid restrictions March 10th, farther reason for price to possibly go up.

&#x200B;

* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \[March 5th\] to Short interest report \[March 9th\] and Earning report \[March 10th after hours into 11th\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.

Yes i know there are some people here who can read words, i need your help. I don't own any Palantir and this is my own opinion and not financial advice. Am trying to determine if i should invest.

I get what Palantir does in terms of a business model. I also saw a post here comparing to $CRM, and here is where i need some help.

Looking at palantir's [10-k](http://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdfhttp://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/97b89af1-0ad9-4daf-a411-6ca576744e7e.pdf), pg 111, 112

cash is 2b+, likely from the public listing, double 2019, a plus.

Revenue is 1.1b up from 742mm in 2019, and i believe guidance for 2021 was another 45% also good.

They only problem i have is stock compensation. I know the company went public and that's a large reason for the number, because if you focus on including it, they has a loss of 1.1b for the year. In of itself as a growth company i get, the only concern is the comparison to $CRM.

$CRM currently puts much of their salary expense into this category, and is maintaining the the business through acquisition. They've been hit hard in earnings as a result 260-->220 and maybe lower? (keep growing revenue, but profit isn't materializing, and they are categorizing stock comp as CapEx because their employees derive compensation (in sales anyway) via stock

has anybody noticed anything similar on $PLTR?

i'm assuming if they deliver on estimates, that's $40 per share by the end of year if not 50 conservatively, but another bout of stock comp will drag the stock.

180,AAL DD (sort of) Don‚Äôt judge me. I am a retard.,2021-03-03 16:20:37,"Okay listen up you fucking apes. Put down the crayons and stop thinking about your wife‚Äôs boyfriend pounding her from both ends. First I have to say that I have no idea what the fuck I‚Äôm talking about and this is NOT A P&amp;D (kinda sus to even say that but fuck it). I‚Äôm actually just expressing my opinions on American Airlines.

Alright let me get into the shit.

*pops addy

I took a Buisness class in college. It was economics and I got a C+ on the final so I‚Äôm pretty schooled when it comes to this shit. This is the thing, the airline industry is an oligopoly. I think. I‚Äôm pretty sure. Basically that means these airline companies are fucking monsters and even when they‚Äôre down bad, they don‚Äôt go out of Buisness most of the time. Now AAL has over a 60% call percentage which doesn‚Äôt really have anything to do with what I‚Äôm saying but whatever.

Point is AAL moved in a patter since it‚Äôs IPO where it rose to around $50 and back down but it keeps doing this‚ÄîI call it the Harry Potter because it looks like his scar when you draw it a little. 

Anyways, before AAL has a chance to go back up to hit that $50 burger, Covid came and fucked the world in its wide asshole and everything took a fall. Now it‚Äôs making a climb and I don‚Äôt see how, in the near to distant future, AAL doesn‚Äôt climb back to around $50. Especially when covid restrictions are cut back around the world and the vaccine rolls out I can‚Äôt see how everyone who‚Äôs been locked up for a year doesn‚Äôt buy the first flight to Boca Raton to visit Gam Gam.

This is all assumptions that I‚Äôm making and the due diligence I did is more introspection done through the smoking of various drugs and chemicals. My brain is fried that‚Äôs a fact, but I just don‚Äôt see how AAL can be at 22 and not be a good buy. I got in at 11 so I‚Äôm chilling but can someone please put me in my place and tell me I‚Äôm a fucking ape. If this shit is the chosen one and I‚Äôm sure it is it‚Äôs gonna Harry Potter back up to 55 for sure sometime in the future so I don‚Äôt see how I can lose.

Disclosure: I am not a stock advisor (that much is obvious) also I eat crayons and try my grandpas pocket pussy every once in a while. It‚Äôs quite enjoyable.

SEC don‚Äôt come after me when AAL hits $55.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm on a diet of crayons and aderall right now but I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôm autistic as shit.

EDIT: to all you apes saying im retarded. Read the title and proceed with caution. I will go full retard at the drop of a fucking hat buddy"

The IDC chart shows that Vonage is a clear leader. Vonage has a significant lead in Video API stuff due to its acquisition of TokBox. It's API business was up 100%+ last quarter. Checkout the last ER transcript - quite a bullish tone for the great business.

UCaaS itself is a great space to be as evidenced by long runway of growth (see TWLO). Legion Partners, an activist has on their case and they have had multiple opportunities to sell at 15+ (since all the back in 2018) but bought more recently.

The most important part for me to take out of this is record such a valuable historic event that ppl would be talking about for the next decades to come. Im not trying to profit off this i just want to create art.

215,PLTR - Newbie Play,2021-03-03 10:02:11,"TLDR: PLTR June 18th 2021 C, 30 strike price.

Firstly thanks for the free tendies @  u/The_Big_Short_2020  50 usd to 1500 usd in three days (screenshot can be attached to post as proof if needed) has been a great ride, and will be executing the 26.50 call options friday into shares (most likely, will update if I dont).

Now that I got a taste for making money, instead of lurking wsb for the last months and loosing money, I decided to post my plays here and here if the first rtard play.

Based on everything Ive seen recently about PLTR (and holding shares for the past 2 months). I decided to get in PLTR call options. Honestly, I have no idea whats PLTR planning in the next coming month, they have some great new partnerships and some awesome (long-term) projects in the pipeline. I have been seeing alot of great DD on PLTR in the sub and others. Other DD suggests that the market cap is way too high for the revenue they are generating. I believe that fundamentals are not the biggest factor anymore, now that all of us got our stim checks, and are yoloing money at shares that never had great fundamentals. True, PLTR may be overvalued, but name a silicon valley company that is not? Furthermore, PLTR is a company that actually has value.  


The play:

Right now the options are going for cheap. The share price has sunk down, after GME gang started loosing money and wsb went quiet. However, we are seeing bullish trends in the entire market, and specifically on the shares this sub is interested in.  
Around Feb 1 the stock was trading at 31 usd and then continued to YTD High of 38 usd on Feb 9th, just lagging behind GME's ATH.   
I suspect that with the new RKT and GME gang making money, they are gonna be just as retarded as me and gonna slowly start cashing out and be just as greedy to find the next play. Unfortunately there is a lack of DD posts and GME and RKT are now flooding wsb, but there has been a steady stream of wsbers buying Palantir stock and call options.

Im buying the call options at 30.00 expiring june 18th 2021, if they are even slightly in the money, I will execute the options. In the big change I am wrong and full of shit, the loss will be minimal.  I am not yoloing my NW but just looking to make some extra.

But when I tried to post an update, it kept getting automodded.

As an update: I took profits on my last play and am now re-allocating them. This is my 1st new play.

&#x200B;

$NOK got a LOT of love when the first $GME spike happened. It got so much love that it popped to nearly 10$/share before RH blocked trading.

Since then, volume's come down, attention has gone away from the stock, this has made options quite appealing.

IV's down significantly and calls are REALLY cheap.

My DD:

* They delivered SOLID Q4 and 2020 earnings, even though it was a tough year in general.
* The company owns the **most** pattents in the 5G space of all it's peers.
* Huauei is being blacklisted in most of the western world, there are only 2 players remaining in the space, Ericcson and Nokia.
* The company is sitting on nearly $8 billion in cash and generates over a billion a year in free cash flow.
* The stock is trading at only 1.5x book value
* They have been increasing the profit margins significantly for the last 3 years and are working towards improving them even more.
* Nokia has announced several solid deals over the past few weeks.

&#x200B;

* **The company is small enough that it could be an M&A target** 
   * The US Attorney General William Barr [said](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-keynote-address-department-justices-china) the US -- either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies -- should purchase a controlling stake in either Nokia or Ericsson for access to secure 5G equipment. He said such a move could blunt the rise of China and Huawei in the space. 
   * AT&T / Tmobile / another carrier could buy them to lower their own costs of updating to 5/6G.
   * Intel and Microsoft are both focusing heavily on the space and Microsoft already bought part of Nokia in the past.

&#x200B;

* There's also the potential for them to reinstate their dividend payment policy.

&#x200B;

* Average analyst price target is 5.75$
* Over the last 10 years, it's been rangebound between 4 and 8$, it's pretty much at the bottom of the range.
* I'm confident it'll be back to 5 or 6$ by the summer, especially if they keep announcing these solid deals.

Positions: 20 000 shares and 100x 6$ calls sold against them for april 16th.

TLDR: Nokia's a great medium-long term play, IV's down significantly, shares and calls are cheap. This will probably bounce from 4$ back towards 6-8$ over the medium term, or be bought out as a strategic play, likely for over 6$.

This is discussion is to just bring awareness to some issues that have been occurring on the subreddit. I'm going to try to avoid bringing my own opinion into this as that doesn't matter. With the millions of new members that have recently joined, there has been a lot of known and unknown misinformation and I've really noticed that it's primarily been in the comments section. 

Now I know the spotlight has been on GME for the past 3ish months but you all really have to remember that this is NOT a GME subreddit. It's awesome that we have people YOLOing their money into GME but the few quality posts on this sub have been swamped by GME content.

**INFO**

There has been hysteria about bots that have been on the sub creating fake content. Now I have no idea whether this is true or not, however, please do not go spreading info around if you are not informed. There have also been posts and comments about ""tactics that short-sellers"" use to manipulate the stock  (that I'm not going to name), which aren't even real tactics. Please, don't just take posts or comments about certain info with a ""grain"" of salt or even a ""pinch"". Take the info you see with a **fist full of salt**. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!! PLEASE!

**""\_\_\_\_ is a distraction from \_\_\_\_\_""**

(this section is where I am mostly biased on) Please. Not everything is a distraction from GME or whatever is the hottest play on WSB. There are literally thousands of other stocks that can be bought or sold. I've seen some people say that they are suspicious of RKT because it came ""out of nowhere"" when there have been dozens of DDs since the stock came onto the market. I've seen comments like ""nIcE tRY heDGieS""....okay right manipulate and trick retail traders to trade over 350M+ shares of RKT so we forget about the past 3 months of GME? Trust me, when you open this subreddit, you almost only see GME. There is no need to remind everyone of the GME short-squeeze. 

**""Where do you get these plays from?""**

You can filter the spam and the memes by filtering by DD mode from the daily thread. There are some AMAZING DDs on this sub, you just have to look for them. Remember to do your own research. DDs should not be your only source of info and make sure the DD has some links to their sources or you can ask the OP. You should primarily look at DDs as simply bring awareness to a company for you to look at, and after further research, you can then decide.

230,A word of caution - Educate yourself about money before you get your hard-earned tendies!,2021-03-03 00:41:41,"Hello fellow apes,

THIS IS MEANT FOR ALL THE NEWBIES WHO ARE NEW TO INVESTING.

Been ruminating about creating this post for a while but thought it would be a good one to share with you wonderful r-tards before our rocket flies to Alpha Centauri.

So we are all patiently waiting for our well-earned tendies to come our way now. For many of us, this will most likely be the most money we have ever had, which is fantastic. I for one can't wait to see this massive wealth transfer happen.

Obligatory ""I am not a financial advisor, this is based on my own experience, knowledge etc"". I work with cash rich investors and find them property investment opportunities so I have HAD to learn about money and investments.

I would caution everyone here a few things when you have your dragon's hoard of tendies:

* **Take a deep breath.**

And resist the immediate urges that come with the notion of having a lot of money. Now read the rest of this post you smooth-brained ape.

* **Remember you might have to pay tax on this money.**

Chances are, you will have to pay tax on your earnings. MAKE SURE YOU PUT ASIDE MONEY FOR THIS. And speak to an accountant if you are unsure about any of this.

* **Don't tell anyone that doesn't need to know.**

Some people changes when it comes to money. The more people you tell, the more random friends you haven't talked to in years will come your way. Hell, even family members might come to you and start asking for monetary favours and chances are you will start running relationships into the ground because of it. DO NOT TELL ANYONE THAT DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

* **Put money aside as saving to tide you over for 3-6 months.**

I don't care that you have a shit-ton of money. What are your living costs? Now make sure you have 3-6 months of that stashed for rainy days (hopefully we won't have any of those).

* **Re-invest most of your money.**

Seriously. Don't withdraw all of it and for fuck's sake do not let all that money sit in a bank. They are currently considering negative interest rates here in the UK, and currently interest rates sit at about 0.01% FUCK ALL. Re-invest it! There are a shit-zillion ways you can do that and I guarantee you all of them will be better than sticking it all in a bank account. I love property! 10-15% returns in the UK, easy peasy. Maybe that's your thing, maybe it isn't.

Also consider this, if you hold a Stocks & Shares ISA, you are LIMITED to only put in ¬£20K per financial year. HOWEVER, all the GAINS you make in that account are free to use AND you don't pay taxes on withdrawals. If you took it all out however you would be limited by the 20K. So maybe you re-invest it in other stocks you like?

Maybe you stick it in a Lifetime-savers account where you benefit from compound interest (if you don't know how powerful this is, look it up!) You could be a millionaire in 30 years by just putting in a couple of thousand every year.

* **Do not upgrade your lifestyle (too much).**

Okay so you want your Lambo, I understand. We all do. We've been living off pot-noodles and crushed up paracetamol for so long now.

Did you know that ONE THIRD of lottery winners usually declare bankruptcy within three to five years? Do you have any idea how many professional athletes go BROKE? (Spoiler, it's a lot).

Why? Because these people have little-to-no financial education. We aren't taught this stuff in school. No one is going to take you hand, you have to teach yourself this stuff.

One of the biggest mistakes people who aren't used to money make, is to immediately buy a massive house, buy gifts for friends & family, buy expensive cars, start hiring staff and so forth. See where I'm getting at?

Ask yourself, do you really need all these luxury goods? Absolutely treat yourself, but understand it can be a VERY slippery slope that you might not be able to sustain. Which is why it is so important to have ASSETS (see point above). That shit will pay you back. Your Lambos and gifts for friends & family, however nice, won't.

* **Treat yourself!**

Read everything above? Good. You can treat yourself now. Otherwise, what's the point? Get that Lambo, you deserve it. After all, you've got money stashed now and you've put most of it into investments that will pay you back and keep you living the sweet life of never having to work again.

That's all for now folks.

Once again, this is NOT financial advice. Do your own research etc. Just be careful with them tendies.

Peace."

This brings me to ASO
Background: Online and brick and mortar business that does sports gear, outdoor supplies, etc. Basically a Scheels, Dicks Sporting Goods. 

Why this could double in the next month.
Majority of shares held by institutional investors. Same as RKT 

High short interest
Similar to that of RKT 

Earnings blowout the last two quarters. 
Same as RKT 

Lower market cap and huge revenue. 
Better ratio than RKT 
(Different Business Model-Changes a Few things) 

Last week sell off did not affect this stock. 
Better than RKT 

Low volume low IV 
Similar to RKT last week 

Earnings report April 8th 
Catalyst: If they have another earnings report like they did last quarter this will do a RKT move. 

Recent IPO in less than a year.
Same as RKT 

Majority of business for this company is brick and mortar and being a pandemic and in a shutdown this company somehow crushed every single earnings beat the last two quarters. With everything opened up and new seasons coming up for recreational sports this thing will moon. 

Way undervalued based on last year results and market cap around 2 billion."

Disclaimer: Current shares holding below; all my debit calls are now maxed out.

I posted this AM ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7xx3/rkt\_ddtendies\_part\_2\_decent\_amount\_of\_squeeze\_left/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw7xx3/rkt_ddtendies_part_2_decent_amount_of_squeeze_left/)) regarding more squeezing when the price was $28.  I thought it would trade sideways and then a crazy afterhours.  Seems the covering occurred early for an explosive afternoon.  I believe the stock will still squeeze more, even to triple digits, as all the ITM call options get exercised this Friday.  **Additionally, there are 03/19 call options up to $50, which mean additional gamma squeeze from options still exists**.  

Interestingly, the despite the short covering, **shorts have increased bringing the total up to 46% or 46% float (data from S3:** [**https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801**](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1366857867416993801)**).**  

**All Catalyst events:**

1) Blowout earnings, and excellent forecast to be successful even when, eventually the interest rates go up.  Remember at the end of the day this is a **profitable** company.

2) Special dividend of 1.11 on 03/08/20.  Other than bleeding the shorts for this dividend, people may recall their shares back to get this true dividend.

3) Increased publicity tomorrow  [https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-to-Participate-in-Morgan-Stanley-Technology-Media--Telecom-Virtual-Conference/default.aspx) 

4) Large institutional ownership and unlikely that the majority shareholders will sell at this point.  They want to trigger a squeeze

5) Rising short interest with a 50% borrowing fee.  There were no shares left to borrow by 11 am and that's why the stock quickly 'rocketed up'.  Currently there are only 15000 shares left to borrow at this time (and none for the few hours after market close) and they will probably be borrowed first thing AM.

6) I have heard more OTM options may be written by the end of this week.

Given the huge runup this week, I'm much more conservative and suggest buying shares or ITM debit spreads, but for the more cavalier of you can buy some OTM 03/19 or, if they make new options this week, some OTM 03/05 options.

**Addendum:** I am not a bot, HF, shill, or a professional investor.  I am not anti-GME and do not think we should all jump ship to RKT.  However, this play, in the short term, appears the most promising."

In typical fashion what happened? the stock TANKS all the way down to $34 which is an INSANE VALUE. This stick was a bargain around 37-38 but now it's just free money when this thing rebounds back to 45 where it was less than a month ago.

Here are the highlights of the earnings call today in case you missed it:

* Net sales increased by 23.1% to $806.8 million, which includes $53.3 million from the 53rd week.
* Comparable store sales increased by 7.9% on a 13-week basis over a 5.1% increase in the same period last year.
* The Company opened eight new stores ending the quarter with 380 stores in six states.
* Net income increased 146.8% to $24.3 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.
* Adjusted net income(1) increased 46.1% to $24.2 million, or $0.24 per non-GAAP diluted share.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 24.7% to $51.2 million.

This is all good news for us and only proves that after the sell off after earnings this thing is going TO THE FUCKING MOON!üöÄ

Here are some highlights from 2020 compared to 2019:

* Net sales increased by 22.5% to $3.13 billion.
* Comparable store sales increased by 12.7% on a 52-week basis compared to a 5.2% increase in the comparable period last year.
* The Company opened 35 new stores and closed two stores during the year.
* Net income increased 592.1% to $106.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted share.
* Adjusted net income(1) increased 86.9% to $112.7 million, or $1.14 per non-GAAP diluted share.
* Adjusted EBITDA(1) increased 32.4% to $222.9 million.

AND if that wasn't good enough here is what things are looking like moving forward for us.The Company currently expects to open between 36 and 38 stores this year with one closure. They anticipate that comparable sales for the first quarter will decline in the negative high-single digits reflecting the impact of cycling the initial demand surge related to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Excluding the impact of discrete items, they anticipates a normalized fiscal 2021 tax rate of 28%.apital expenditures, net of tenant improvement allowances, are estimated to be approximately $130.0 million.

This is an extremely cyclical stock and moving into spring and summer are the biggest months for GO as cooking and overall grocery shopping increases. I can't overstate how undervalued they are right now at $34 and the calls are DIRT CHEAP.

Positions or GFTO:

3/19 40$ Calls - 35

4/16 40$ calls - 50

6/16 40$ calls - 50

I know march 19th seems soon but this thing is going to rebound very quickly with the rest of the market and they are so cheap I couldn't pass them up. WE WILL see $45 by the end of March, I am NOT financial analyst, I eat crayons with a straw, please do your own DD.

TLDR; GO is stupid cheap right now and is going to go HARD the next couple weeks - don't miss out BUY THE FUCKING DIP!"

# The Good Stuff

$ON    Semiconductors, manufacture and sell semiconductor components for    various electronic devices worldwide. Their semiconductors are used in    automotive, industrial computers, robots, and appliances.

""Other    manufacturing companies are getting left behind in the semiconductor    shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars,  whether   they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions  for  every  manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That  means  assembly   line robots, it means motor controls for CNC machines  and  shop   equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and   microwave. It  even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending   it all after  you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the   toaster, which uses a   power switch, which are made by $ON. ""

A    new CEO was brought in with tremendous experience in the  semiconductor   industry (sound familiar?) that has experience growing  both revenues  and  margins at Cypress Semiconductors. **Hassane El-Khoury**; the man, the myth, a new tendie legend. Already a moving force in the semiconductor world, [he    was a pointing factor behind the merger of Infineon Technologies and    Cypress which could point out the eventual direction of the  organisation](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/company/cypress-acquisition/) as ""one of the world's top 10 semiconductor manufacturers"".

I'm    a grower and not a show-er, so if you want growth you can actually   hear  it from me personally. This company is a killer for revenue   because  they are financially stable and very profitable as is this   play.

""The    one thing that sets   $ON apart from the rest of the equities on  this    list is that  they're  not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not  a    company that  simply  outsources chip production to other people     (overseas) and  who has  shown a willingness to keep some production in     house.   Matter of  fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that  he     wants to  maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.   Which     means  when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer  money   to    build out US production, they'll have their hands out.""

252,Clov Fundamentally sound outlook. Why Clover Health is retarded.,2021-03-03 06:28:57,"I've bought the falling knife. I enjoy high risk. Let me run you down some fundamentals on why this is an advanced long. Pun intended. (My screen name.)

Let's get to the meaty part first. 

Lesson #1 Fraud is the most bullish word on Wall street, but even better is Monopoly, and Antitrust. Which is why retail weak fingers are getting walked down. (Regulation is the most feared btw.) If it wasnt for Clover health pulling some strings behind the scenes I dont think they would exist. Clov was caught running a red light, so take the fine, and get back in your Tesla. If not for fraud they wouldn't last a year. United health, and Blue cross would've destroyed them right outta the gate.  Look at the most fraudulent companies in the world. They're sporting the highest market caps. Ask Tesla bear scrubs Einhorn, and Gordon Johnson about how Tesla is a fraud. Apple, Msft, Amzn,  seen fraud litigations. Bring in Vivek, and Chamath. Accused of fraud. Get the point? Fraud is bank as long as your the fraud.

Who cares about Last year? You've heard this right?

""**Past performance** is **no guarantee** of future **results**""

A. Grew membership by 36.3%

B. Increased revenue by 45.6%

C. Gross profit increased to 12.2% of revenue

This means absolutely nothing. Again. **""Past performance is never an indicator of Future results.""**

**4 F's  - Future Fun Facts & fundamentals. Speculative Statistics.**

A.  The number of Americans ages 65 and older will more than double over the  next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040. The number of adults ages  85 and older, the group most often needing help with basic personal  care, will nearly quadruple between 2000 and 2040.  üëà  (Try search engine)

***Those statistics come true. Minimum +200% customers***

B. Government Medicare spending is set to increase from 15% to 19% üëà  (Try search engine)

***More revenues from the budget.***

C. Medicare for all. üëà  (Try search engine)

***""Medicare for all"" would push our potential customer base to the moon. (Full Population)***

D.. Clover health's competitors have over a trillion dollars in market cap to swipe.

***Always good to have healthy competition. UNH, ANTM, HUM, CI, plus private ones like Aetna***

E,F,G Highly Speculative. It's a healthcare insurer that's only medicare, and not yet in the workplace.

***If Clover health enters the entire health insurance market whole different valuation is coming.***

&#x200B;

TLDR; For those that are patient. This could be a really great long term growth investment. Clover health currently has less than 1% of available participants in healthcare marketplace.

Aside from the celebrity status of certain board members I'm going to tuck this one under the mattress, set a recurring investment, and probably have fun losing everything if tit's go up."

IT‚ÄôS THE MOST SHORTED STOCK RIGHT NOW

https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today

To the moon we go üöÄüöÄüöÄ

PREVIOUS DD:

$SKT DD (Tanger Outlet Malls) *VALUE PLAY* please read üòå

9th most shorted stock right now, great re-opening play to cope with new Covid environments. Tanger literally has open air malls that make it really unique in this new era of bricks and mortar retail.

Now, let‚Äôs look at the technicals. It currently has a 52% short float, which lags large squeezes like GME (121%) and SPCE (72%), but exceeds that of other performing names like AMC and BB.

I think $SKT is so compelling at a roughly $1.2B market cap. For comparison, its primary competitor $MAC has double the valuation, but does not have the same flexible retail space as Tanger.

If you look at GME‚Äôs short squeeze, they shot up right around $20 or ($1.2B market cap)!! üëÄ Furthermore, Melvin and other big hedge funds are long on their $SKT shorts, and any surprise to the upside will send the stock absolutely flying.

Tanger has also reinstated their dividend. In a time where many bricks and mortar retail shops are desparate for cash, $SKT is out here with $700M of liquidity.

Companies with this much cash relative to their market cap are INTRINSICALLY UNDERVALUED. Even if this thing were to just double in market cap to just under $3B, that would leave a share price of roughly $32. The intrinsic value of the mall network is worth AT LEAST (in my mind) 5-7X where we are now at roughly $13 ($1.2B). 

These other names that I mentioned above have taken off given their market cap of $3-5B, and I FULLY EXPECT THAT RALLY TO CONTINUE. The short interest here is just too overwhelming for it to not push the stock flying at the slightest uptick.

But for the best value play, FACTORED WITH THE HEAVY SHORT FLOAT, I gotta go with $SKT. Holding 3200 shares at $17 and adding more as we go down. 18.7 days left for shorters to cover, so I think the squeeze is coming soon.

** Check out Tanger‚Äôs new CEO, Steven Yalof, if you are interested. He was a prominent leader at Simon Property Group, with the intent on expanding consumer base beyond retail stores. Let‚Äôs hope he get‚Äôs it right with $SKT. üôèüèæ

(for context I do a mix of day trading and swing trading while going 2-3 months at a time not trading when my money is tied up)

Every time I do something right and see the profits, I do something wrong that means averaging down and waiting another few months before I can get my money out with any sort of profit.  

I realize it's a learning experience and I'm learning from making mistakes. But like most newbs the goal is to learn to make less mistakes as quickly as possible. So far I've been able to save myself every time but dam it's emotionally exhausting doing little but damage control and chasing to get my profits back. 

Any advice for getting rid of bad habits quickly?

Some of my worst habits that I'm trying to break:

1. FOMO on auto pilot usually from the ""this ones been a gold mine, just 'one' more time. To be fair, it's usually when I'm distracted that this has been the worst 
2. Changing my mind on exit points depending on the situation and having to wait it out because I missed jumps and became a bag holder 
3. Numerous others that my brain can't think of currently

I pay for Reuters Eikon, it's $1200 / month or something like that. Outside of Bloomberg Terminal, it's the most used financial data tool in the world. Bloomberg dominates the US...but Eikon dominates Europe.   


I've seen a post from yesterday claiming there is high short interesest in $RKT. However, the OP wrote some misleading / straight up incorrect information.

&#x200B;

1. Claims that the CEO owns 95% of the shares
2. Claims that 35% of the outstanding shares are shorted

&#x200B;

What are the facts?

1. Does the CEO / Founder own 95% of the shares? Let's check ownership in Eikon.
2. Is there high short interest / probability of a short squeeze?

&#x200B;

1. Institutional Ownership overview here shows that there is no possible way the CEO / Founder owns 95% of the outstanding shares according to the post in reference. 

[Institutional Ownership in $RKT](https://preview.redd.it/22ehxlawjmk61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ec3a6ac75caa1eaa60158da8df55099a770d115)

&#x200B;

2. Eikon works with a company called StarMine. They have a model that applies scores to a potential short squeeze. When Gamestonks was under $30 in January....the Short Squeeze score for Gamestonks was 100....yes 100 out of 100. 

&#x200B;

$RKT has a score of 45.   


what does this score mean?  


The current 1-100 percentile rank of the security versus all other US traded stocks on the Short Interest Indicator, based on volatility and liquidity. A score of 91 indicates that only 9% of stocks have a higher likelihood of a significant relative price rise in the next 30 days. 

&#x200B;

This tells us that 55% of other stocks have a higher likelihood of a significant price rise in the next 30 days....

286,UPDATE: Gold Silver Basel III and NSFR,2021-03-03 17:46:47," **Everyone** needs to pay attention to what's going on here. I'm talking about a global reset of precious metals, most importantly Gold and Silver. If you are skeptical, I guarantee it is simply because you have yet to do your own due diligence so far. When futures contracts on the COMEX go into backwardation, you know something has broken. This has already happened once in February and is likely again. the Big Guys are trying to force people out of paper Gold and Silver.

The deadline is 28 June 2021, which is when the NSFR goes into effect. Do your research.

I'm not at all suggesting to put all your eggs into one basket, but you should be aware of what's going on here (big banks trying to crush small guys because they are at risk of losing trillions, yes TRILLIONS).

NSFR is a requirement for all the global Central Banks. the exact details are explained in the Basel III requirements. there are multiple dates involved with Basel III, but the deadline for the NSFR is 27 June. So on 28 June, Gold and Silver will be repriced to match the true price, which has never happened. There is likely to be a run up the month prior as well.

Long term, this is good for providing stability to the world's central banks (like the U.S. Federal Reserve), but the ""smaller"" banks, like Goldman Sachs, BoA, LBMA, JPM, etc, will be banged up along they way as they drastically try and cover their short positions or other positions not equally weighted to Gold, prior to the reevaluation of Gold and Silver. Just watch. These big banks wont benefit much from additional short selling either. Gold is already at a very technical low, matching the technical low in late 2018. What the CEOs of GS and JPM are going to be doing, and have been doing, is playing down Gold and Silver to the public, while purchasing it in the background.

Stay informed, and good luck."

I think that once GME hits $1000 on this squeeze, every one of you should try recover your original investment in order to remove the emotional element of holding. For example, if you invested $1000 to buy 10 shares of GME at a SP of $100 and we squeeze to $1000...I would recommend that you sell off 1 share of GME to recover your original $1000 then just HOLD the FUCK out of the other 9 shares üëãüíéüëãüíéüëãüíéüëãüíéüëãüíé until we hit some RIDICULOUS share price üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

The first trade makes no sense.  You are locking up almost 5 million dollars for less than 1% interest for 6 weeks.  Even if its free money I don't get it.  If its a hedge for the 22-27 strikes...why bother? 

Why were people buying and selling so many puts in the same range.  All 500 contract lots.  

None of this makes any sense.  Anyone have a guess?"

300,Blackberry Stock Research,2021-03-02 22:51:01,"**Transition from hardware to software**

Blackberry has transitioned from a hardware cellphone maker to a software developer focused on cyber security.

Benefits of this include transitioning away from a highly saturated market dominated by big players such as Samsung, Apple and Huawei. This has increased gross margins to 76% up 29 points from 2016. 

This move has also expanded Blackberry‚Äôs reach in terms of different industries as they provide cybersecurity for average consumers, automakers (particularly in the ev and autonomous vehicle sectors), governments (used by 18 of the G20 countries) and banking/finance (used by the top 9/10 banks in the world.

Another positive of this move is that it has put Blackberry into a fast growing industry in cybersecurity. Since the beginning of Covid 19, the transition to online work has quickened. With this cyber crime has also sped up. As well with technology being integrated into every part of our lives such as smart homes and cars the need for strong cybersecurity has been on the rise. According to Forbes the industry is currently worth $173b and is expected to rise to $270b by 2026.

**Blackberry Services**

Cylance

Cylance is the average consumer product. It is an antivirus that detects malware and ransomware. It uses a subscription based model. The technology is very good and easy to use although lacks some features found in competitors such as Norton or McAfee. Overall the product needs some improvement but is still very good.

Blackberry QNX

Blackberry QNX is the auto protection product. It is currently used in 175 million cars. They have recently announced partnerships with AWS and Baidu to expand this product. The Baidu partnership should open Blackberry up to the large and fast growing Chinese EV market. Another positive about this product is that regulation around the security of cars is increasing as more technology is incorporated into the vehicles. As the global EV market increases so should QNX.

Other Products

Blackberry makes a ton of other products such as IVY, UEM, SPARK among many others. 

**Financial Information (USD)**

Revenue: Blackberry lost $150 million in 2020. Comes to $0.32 a share.

Assets: Blackberry owns over 38000 patents. They also have $3.888 billion worth of assets.

**Conclusion**

I believe that Blackberry is a buy in the long run. They are in a fast growing industry and have some of the best software in the industry.

**My Position**

I currently own 45 shares @ $15.33 CAD

On down days like today, where you have funds moving out of securities, coupled with an earnings report that has a lack of guidance....you get a stock that is extremely oversold. $TGT is one of those stocks.  


You can check my post history and see my post about buying puts on $DASH...got a lot of flack for that one, worked out quite well. 

# Earnings

The Good:

* Sales increased 19.8% to $93.6bn from $78.1bn last year.
* Digital sales (including home delivery and in store pickup) increased by 145%
* **Sales growth of more than $15bn...this is more than its total sales growth over the last 11 years combined.**
* Net earnings increased 33.1% to $4.4bn

The ""Bad""

* $TGT plans to spend $4bn per year remodeling stores, opening new stores and on the supply chain to help with online orders.

I wouldn't take this as a bad sign, if they're working to improve e-commerce that's a good sign even if there is a vaccine and re-opening...shopping trends change as people who wouldn't normally shop online now understand how convenient it is.

&#x200B;

# Apple Partnership Expansion

* Last week Target announced it was building upon its longstanding partnership with Apple to include an ""enhanced Apple shopping experience""...essentially a mini Apple store inside of Target. [https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/target-apple-store-experience/](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/target-apple-store-experience/)

# Dividend King?

* Target has raised its dividends for 49 years straight.
* Only 27 companies have increased dividends for 50 years straight....Target will be the next, making it a Dividend King.
* Target offers a 1.5% dividend yield...this is in line with other S&P500 stocks

# Data

* $TGT hit a high of $193.58 today before sharply turning downward and hitting a low of $172.17 ending the day down -6.67%. In After Hours $TGT is sitting at $174.6
* Analyst for $TGT have zero sell recommendations with a current price target of $200.81

* If we look at the options volume for today on $TGT there were 2x the calls bought compared to puts.

# Wrapping it Up

* Target has a lot going for it.
   * Dividends - as volatility remains and the 10yr rises, money will be moving from riskier growth / tech stocks into risk off stocks and stocks with dividends.
   * Target fits in with the shopping trend changes in e-commerce / e-commerce growth
   * Target fits in with the re-opening narrative as shoppers who want to shop in person, can, and Target will be making the stores better by making investments in improving them.

# Positions

* I have 100 shares for now, I'll be checking the options pricing tomorrow and looking at potential calls I'll want to buy.

305,GME's Future: Steamkiller,2021-03-03 22:18:25,"So I've worked in the game industry as a Tech Artist for just over 8 years now, and I connected some dots in January while reading through all the DD about GME. I still hold to my guess that Ryan is aiming at launching an online distribution service to compete with Steam, and potentially overtake it as the strongest digital games distribution platform.

Why? Steam doesn't have much competition outside of other publishers who mostly just have a store to front their own games. An unbiased online platform that also has physical stores where you can buy consoles, PC parts, and trade in used games for credit in said online platform? It's not a gold mine, it's a diamond-encrusted tendie mine waiting to be found. Gamestop has the ability to focus nearly all of their resources around this strategy, and now is the time to do it before other competitors (Epic, GoG) get too involved.

Ryan already has a focus on digital commerce and there is a reason he started following Steam and Epic, and why they are moving more into PC gaming and improving their digital footprint. I can't tell you how long I have felt that Steam is kind of a monopoly in the market, and whoever manages to launch a solid competitor to them is going to be rich beyond their wildest dreams.

Steam makes 30% from the sale of every single game on their platform, and they have a ridiculously small staff running the entire service. It's built to be almost entirely automated, even down to the advertisements running on the store pages. I talked to a bunch of Valve guys at an indy conference a couple years ago and they said the amount of money Steam makes is disgusting considering how little is needed to keep it running, and it needs almost no improvement since it runs well and people like it. 

If they pull it off and become a major competitor to Steam, a 40b, 50b, and even 100b market cap isn't unrealistic in 5 years. Why? If you knew how many games Steam sells on an average basis, you would crap yourself. And as I said, they take a 30% cut across the board. Do you know how much 30% of every game sold on Steam is? I'll give you a hint: it's a lot. Steam is essentially printing money right now with no real competition. Epic Games is still getting started and is popular with only a few of their titles so far, they are expanding but their focus is divided between the store, Fortnite, publishing, and of course their Engine, which I use regularly and love.

A 100b market cap would value GME at $1431 per share if compared to today's 124 @ 8.66b, at regular market valuation. That's not the squeeze number. 

I'm not a trade aficionado so my calculations about the valuations may not be spot on since my specialty is in my industry and not finance. But Steam has been without any real competition for a decade now, and Gamestop has the capital, infrastructure, and now the leadership to make this happen.

I'm looking forward to the squeeze as much as the rest of you but to be 100% honest, this is going to go Nuclear if I am right, and not as a temporary squeeze. I could be wrong, but in my mind it would be stupid of them not to do it, they have all the pieces ready, and Ryan is the puzzlemaster. Let's fucking go.

311,The case for $CLOV - a Chamath dud or a real opportunity?,2021-03-03 22:17:10,"tl;dr $CLOV has almost $1B in cash, estimated to do $800MM+ revenue in 2021, shorts brought it down 50% in a month from $17 to $8üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

$CLOV was a private company up until 2021. As a private company, the last financing it took valued the company at $3.4B. This was a series E financing. Prior to the series E, the company was valued at $1.7B in 2019 in a series D financing. The company is currently worth $3.35B in market cap, which is less than their last valuation as a private company (their series E).

Since their series D in 2019, the company has grown revenue significantly to $672MM, reduced losses significantly to an EBIT of -35MM, AND collected roughly a billion dollars in funding from their public market debut. They have a billion in dry powder, and a rough plan for profitability in a couple years - but lots of growth in the meantime.

For 2021, the company expects to do around $800MM+ in revenue, and then likely over a billion or at least close to it in 2022.

As of today, EVERY investor in the company from series E, SPAC, PIPE, and every subsequent IPO investor is losing money.

Now, why is this happening? Well a couple reasons:
1. Hindenburg released a hit piece on the company will very loose language and accusing the company of not disclosing an inquiry by the DOJ.
2. After this hit piece, the SEC opened an investigation that the company confirmed - this open investigation creates uncertainty
3. Tons of shorts just hammering this stock

The company has an AI platform that they use to help make medical care better and more efficient, which in turn drives down the cost of delivering healthcare, which increases their margins. As they continue to grow, their data set gets better and that will continue to lower costs. As more doctors get used to it, it's also possible that they could spin out the product and sell the usage to other insurance companies, just like Epic sells EMRs to everyone.

Is the floor in? It's unclear. This could drop to from $8 down to $7 if the shorts remain in control. I use interactive brokers, and they show about 340k shares available to short. This is less shares available to short than in NOK, NAKD, SOS, etc. The Short interest I estimate is about 25%-30% with short utilization at 100% right now based on my broker info.

I was holding 20,000 shares in the company at $11.75, and then sold at $10.75. I then got back in at $9.20 with 10,000 shares, only to see the price sink even further!

I believe that the stock is being held down now because:
1. Short sellers
2. low buying confidence, partially due to the SEC case uncertainty.

I believe the stock will fly without a real short squeeze when:
1. The SEC comes out and either fines the company or says they are free and clear. Either way, there is certainty, so the it will fly.
2. A large investor comes in and buys at this level, which gives confidence to other investors.

I believe the above will happen without a real short squeeze and will generate 50% return from where we are now (from $8 to $12).

If the exuberance builds around this company due to the renewed confidence, coupled with the SEC determining no wrongdoing, this thing flies up to $20 - it was $17 in january. If shorts get trapped, this goes up even further.

Nasdaq has been dropping, but it's almost impossible to justify shaving off any more value from the market cap.

the big IF is for some reason this company that has been around for years, funded by some of the best venture investors in silicon valley, making real revenue, with real customers, is somehow found that they are a total fraud or have done something to sink their entire business, this could go to zero. But I find it highly unlikely that anyone could seriously entertain this idea - but it's a nonzero possibility I guess.

Invest at your own risk - this isn't advice - just some thoughts on why CLOV is down for the count and why I think this is a likely 50% short term return, 100% medium term return, and even better if certain catalysts happen."

TL;DR Rocket Labs is actually going to the moon, confirmed. [I shit you not.](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/missions/lunar/)

If you didn‚Äôt read into the news, company deck and analysis out there, here is the important shit.

**TAM**

* Forecasted to be 1.4T in 2030
* Space is the next frontier, unforeseen TAM expansion

I know your smooth brains can't even predict where you'll wake up tomorrow morning, but this is like trying to forecast how big the internet was going to be in Stanford's basement.

**Backers**

* Solid names like Lockeed and Blackrock. When you say Blackrock and Rocket in the same sentence, you know it's game over
* Auntie Cathie is probably eye balling this company hard, probably trying to come up with excuses on why it should be added to each ETF
* SpaceX only allowed 69 investors in for the last raise, people are hungry to throw money at it. The line to get in is longer than the unemployment line. Where do you go when you can't get in?

**Revenue growth**

* Easily beat 2021 forecast, already 90% booked, this is straight out of their pitch deck. Yes, companies lie, but go look at [this man's face](https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-ceo-peter-beck-explains-why-the-company-needs-a-bigger-rocket-and-why-its-going-public-to-build-it/), would he lie to you?
* Government (not just US) space spending will increasing YoY. Biden wants to leave a mark, and not the kind of shit on the backwall of his toilet bowl.
* Space Startups increasing YoY, and everyone needs a ride to orbit. This is like 2 am when the club closes, everyone wants an Uber but there ain't enough drivers. RL's launches are already booked out.
* Satellites as a service is a new business model, making it accessible for a lot more companies, already picking up traction. Ryan Cohen with his own GME satellites? Hell, this sub can probably pool together for WBS satellite.

**CEO**

* Does actual rocket engineering like Elon, you don't want some bean counter.
* Guy is a genius, multiple records and awards, [he has actually sat on a rocket and set a land speed record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-06-29/at-18-he-strapped-a-rocket-engine-to-his-bike-now-he-s-taking-on-spacex)
* Elon has is a busy man, he's looking after 4 different companies. This is Peter's only focus.
* Let's be honest, better accent, and bigger belly. This is good.

**Moat**

* Vertically integrated entire Rocket and Satellite manufacturing process. They make their own shit.
* Already becoming a supplier for component ingredients. They supply people their shit.
* Patents build up of 3D printed rocket engine designs, battery integration, etc. Had me at 3D printing.
* Private, government back launch sites dedicated to RL. This is the new hot real estate.

**Brand**

* Proven track record. They've launched 97 Rockets to date, this is more than 69 for those of you that can't count.
* Multiple government contracts, NASA level shit
* Elon tweets @ em, we all know what Elon's tweets can do
* Their logo is a üöÄ

**Competition**

* Only 2 companies consistently making it to orbit: SpaceX and RL
* SpaceX dead set focused on Mars colony with Starship, (retired F1, likely F9). RL will happily take that piece of the pie. RL is going to the Moon [and Venus](https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-private-venus-mission-2023.html). To me, we're are going to another fuckin planet, don't care which one.
* Everyone else either is showing no results, and/or struggling with failures, delays and change in management. Rockets are hard, who knew, even Bezos' Blue Origin is laggin.

**Short term catalysts**

* Moon mission is going to going to make waves, but I don't need to tell you that.
* ARK will add, just a question of for how many ETFs.
* Look, they can do up to 120 launches a year, the viewership for these launches are trending up, the only different is, there will now be a stock ticker watermarked to screen. This is GME billboards on steroids."

322,Why RKT still has upside and lots of room to run:,2021-03-02 23:17:07,"Look, I am just here for the tendies like the rest of you. I've been in finance for 10 years. It was my first career, and then I moved on to own several small businesses simultaneously. 

When I saw the GME trade last month, I believe I saw it the same way that many WSB outsiders saw it: a new era in trading. 

I instantly joined your forum and was pleasantly surprised at the intelligence carefully concealed under the constant barrage of circle jerking, banana eating, tendie getting, cursing, and obscure references.... But I could read in between the lines, started paying attention, and thanks to some excellent DD by a few of you, I executed the best trade of my life on RKT today. That said.... There's still space. Here's why:

The dividend announcement should get everyone's attention. At $23-24, it was basically giving away 5% to shareholders. Big institutions will pile in for the free money. That run will probably continue through Friday.  This is the first dividend the company has announced.

RKT financials are actually BLOWING AWAY the industry. Check them out. This is not a company that MIGHT become profitable someday. This is the real deal on earnings. 

Share price has been historically suppressed since inception of the ticker. Check out the trading range for yourself. 

In comparison to trading multiples of competitors, they are trading at prices that are lower than normal. 

Finally, I believe we have huge momentum and attention from today's trading. Take a good look and do what you feel. 

Thanks guys for letting me play along. I wish my great grandfather, an old school New York banker, who grew up a poor black child in Bulgaria, could see this...

Onward apes."
323,"RKT gains, i had a super rough 2020. This money will change my future for the better. I made more money in this one day then i did in all of 2018. Get them gains boys/girls",2021-03-02 21:39:37,
324,Rant about bond yields,2021-03-03 02:32:20,What people don‚Äôt understand is that stuff reopening is exactly why bond yields are going up. Our velocity of money will spike up and we‚Äôll get the inflation from the 22% of our monetary supply we printed in 2020. And bonds have to compete with inflation. So yields will go up making the algos we use favor value instead of growth now. A simple way to put it is If bonds are 2.5% that‚Äôs like a 40 P/E ratio and the s&p(the stock market) is at 39. Then you have to have compression in the markets. I know most people don‚Äôt understand how inflation can lead to lower stock prices in the medium term but it‚Äôs all over the news now if you watch so I‚Äôm not making things up. It erodes the future purchasing power and eroding the growth potential until the inflation hits the real economy boosting their bottom line. But until then bond yields will rally on our reopening and stocks will have to have multiple compression of the pe‚Äôs or  price to sales ratios if they have no earnings. The reason we have had this bull run was low yields and rates due to how bonds and stocks constantly compete for investor dollars so if rates are low they have nowhere to go other than equities. I know that a lot of you have been born in this bull run. as in haven‚Äôt seen a market that doesnt only go up. This multiple compression will happen if we get the new stim bill and open up like Texas. Thus overstimulating the economy and causing inflation that bonds will react to faster than the inflation hits companies bottom lines. it also effects the multiples of growth names due to yield competition.
325,DD NVAX Next Squeeze currently at absurdly good buy point.,2021-03-03 04:46:38,"Tldr; 
Nvax saves the fucking world along with multiple other companies.  Maybe usa last. Shorted to hell. Shares cheap as fuck rn. Primed for lift off. May get a lil cheaper first , so watch it a little b4 you buy. Ceo projected 20 billion dollars revenue 2022. Market cap is under 15. You do the math


Im here to tell you all what play im currently holding 30 shares in and plan to double down on in the morming because the price is insanely good, and tbh may even get better in coming days from a buyers perspective. It is currently down 43% from its ath, only reached due tl INTERIM p3 results. 
Lets start with the bad. 

In 33 years theyve never reached full fda approval for anything. Close but no cigar every time. 

It has held a steady slightly pessimist short interest of 10% for the entire time ive been invested, but in that time institutional ownership has climbed from 49% to about 88% now. I have strong reason to believe this short interest is now much larger. Please read on. 
When the nasdaq is down and theres no good news for the stock, it sinks. When theres mildly good news, the stock sinks. Shorts? Maybe.

Many big money vaccines already approved. US market share likely holding mass inventory of big pharma and baby oil vaccines by the time FDA approves. This doesnt matter too much, the united states has a contract with nvax for 100 million doses at 16 a pop that they buy on fda approval, period.  The big pharma vaccines efficacys vs variants and transmission are laughable. The world is a  breeding ground for variants right now. A problem novavaxs platform will easily develop quadralent boosters for. 

Honestly, theres not a whole lot of bad imo. These bad things seems good to me. 
The good.
Its absurdly cheap right now, almost as cheap as before p3 interim data. This is because the ceo sucks at talking and people dont like the 1 to 2 month timeline he mentiomed on nbc yesterday for approvals. That same morning he told new york times ""he loves burning shorts"".
Last week, boris johnson said novavax approval was coming soon. 
The market price never reacted to the covax deal of 1.1 billion doses because we dont know the price yet, and shorts are trying to say the 3 dollars poor countries will pay is what nvax will get per dose. Thats not how donation and subsidization works. Nvax is getting way more than 3. At least 10. 
Its efficacy is first class, please look it up, the scientists online have already explained it better than i can. 
Today the price tanked , due to his interview yesterday RIGHT AFTER SAYING HE LOVES BURNING SHORTS. Yes he said fda is 2-3 months out.
They have rolling approvals in dozens of places happening! And their final phase 3 data can drop anytime!. The short interest has been 10% for a while and i just KNOW its higher now.
Institutional holdings hasnt dropped. The name novavax is appearing in the news more and more. Its happening this month. Idk how long shares will be near 200, i wouldnt be surprised if you can pick some up for 180 tomorrow. But theres a squeeze coming. Not like gme was, this isnt hundreds of percent short. Its in the teens. That will still be a nice spike to an already large biotech spike.

B.riley eoy price target : 398. 
I think we see more than that. Weve already seen 330.
The news that propels us could happen any day. But dont leave gme. Im in there too. But if any of the squeezes your in do their thang, and nvax is still down, double check to make sure nothing bad happened with the stock and then bring those tendies over for more tendies!!!"

Lots of profit taking, and it's hard to watch red candles, but that's the market. Added 500 shares on the way down. Lots of hate on RKT for being a pump, however it will trade on the same dynamics as the first GME squeeze, albeit lower amplitude.

Update @ 3:23pm EST

The price has progressed as expected. **The $60 target may be reached much faster.** Being short going into spring/summer mortgage season is an incredibly stupid trade. Please look at the bellow income growth! **1161%!** Not only is this a good company on the fundamentals but going short on a float of only **108.5 million** is a huge risk. **I reiterate my $60 call.**

&#x200B;

I'll keep it brief:

* Estimated short interest @ 45%!
* Special dividend of $1.11 payable in 21 days, meaning shorts will have to cover $47million in div payments alone, compounded with a 53% margin rate to borrow shares.
* There are only 400 shares @ Interactive Brokers left to borrow!
* The mortgage refi industry is going to rip into 2021 onwards with easy money policy, and RKT has excellent cash flow and price/book of 5!
* ZERO insider selling in last 12 months, only BUYING @ $14.41million
* Even mainstream analysts have price target at $24.47, and they always have to be conservative.

If I were short I would be shitting my pants, this a setup that will send the stock to at least $60 by 21-march IMO.

I'm an actual financial advisor, 12 years of experience. In for 500 Shares and adding calls.

*Special Dividend*

* Our Company's Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $1.11 per share payable on March 23, 2021 to holders of our Class A common stock of record at the close of business on March 9, 2021. During the year, we achieved significant growth and generated capital at a rate where we were able to fully re-invest in our business and have excess funds available to distribute to our shareholders. We will fund the special dividend from cash distributions of approximately $2.2 billion.

Here to talk about a company with alot of potential that isn‚Äôt GME or RKT. I know, I know, sad and im retarded and should just buy those stocks

Lordstown motors is IMO a heavily overlooked and undervalued EV stock that has not had its fair chance to flourish yet. 

-They will be the first electric pickup truck to market -They have a 600 acre factory right here in the USA
- A partnership with Camping world ( I know lame but distribution= üöÄ )
-100k preorders
-45k price tag on the pickup after government incentives (52k without)
-Backing by GM
 
All with only a 3.4B market cap. 
If only half of the none binding preorders got filled(which is unlikely because the average order size is 600 and you need to set up charging stations for all those trucks at there destinations and that takes time and planning) that would be 2.6B in revenue. Almost the market cap currently. The orders will keep coming and the technology will be proven. 


Analyst are attacking this stock for reasons I havent figured out yet. Morgan Stanley downgraded there price target due to not believing in Hub motor technology. How often do you think a guy at morgan stanley works on cars!? One of his concerns was running coolant lines to the wheels.... You know like where your brake lines go, and your wheel speed sensor harness, and vacuum lines... this guy had never even changed a flat tire.

They are also now reprinting old articles of a very early ‚Äúskateboard‚Äù(thats what lordestown calls the underlying design) on fire. Shit happens, the car was so early at that point it didnt even have the pickup body it comes with at that time. Also thats why they do these test. Go on there twitter and watch the test they put the hub motors through and the rest of the truck.

Another fear is ford, does anyone even know any other type of ford besides an F-150? So ford is gonna make and electric truck to compete against the only thing keeping them in business?! Im not saying ford wont have a nice electric truck but I do think they arent a good long play.

352,High Times IPO - A Dying Brand ‚Äî> From Selling Mags to Selling Bags,2021-03-03 04:57:33,"High Times is a - beloved - American monthly magazine and cannabis brand with offices in Los Angeles and New York City. The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom For√ßade and the publication advocates the legalization of cannabis. The magazine has been involved in the marijuana-using counterculture since its inception.

On Jan 29th, 2020, ditched dreams of [NASDAQ Listing](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/high-times-ditches-dreams-of-nasdaq-listing/)

>Hightimes Holding Corp., parent of High Times, revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the NASDAQ, a goal it had been pursuing for since mid-2017. The company launched an offering two years ago at $11 per share through the Reg A+ process, and it reported that it would extend its Reg A+ capital raise until 4.545 million shares had been sold or until March 31st. It disclosed in an SEC filing that it recently sold 363,636 shares at $5.50 in a private placement to Ontario-based Rayray Investments (Raymond Leach, an original investor in MedReleaf), a 50% discount to where it has been selling shares.

High Times securities lawyers, Stephen Weiss and Megan Penick of L.A. based Michelman Robinson LLP, confirmed in an email interview that the company can not accept sales until they get their annual report filed and publicly available for investors.

[High Times IPO - Sorry, No Refunds - Teri Buhl of Cannabis Law Reports Talks Reg A](https://vimeo.com/438846483)

**Harvest Acquisitions**

It was in March that Harvest Health announced an $80 million buyout of that entire company. Then, literally two months later, we see a letter of intent filed by Hightimes now and Harvest saying, 

>""Okay well, we're actually going to buy the California assets of Have a Heart."" 

Why that was contradictory is that Harvest had just been on an investor call telling people, when an analyst asked, 

>""Why are you doing this deal?"" They said, ""Well, we want a stronger footprint in California."" 

It didn't make sense that two months later they're getting rid of everything they just bought in California.

Additionally, in the last month there have been[multiple news reports](https://mjbizdaily.com/high-times-cannabis-retail-bid-complicated-by-web-of-owners-social-equity-partners/amp/) questioning if Harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to High Times.

Very little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by High Times; instead it has announced millions of stock *(which isn‚Äôt publicly traded yet)* will pay for the asset purchases. With the Harvest acquisition, High Times attorney Stephen Weiss confirmed for CLR that $1.5 million was paid to Harvest but at signing only $500k was given. The asset purchase agreement filed with the SEC said High Times would pay Harvest $1 million on signing.

This is just a complete lack of transparency, and it's completely unfair for the Main Street investor trying to get into cannabis.

**Done before starting**

The Securities and Exchange Commission has told a U.S. operated cannabis media and dispensary company, High Times Holdings, that they must halt accepting investments in their mini-IPO because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report.

>The last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of June.

High Times used a reporting extension the SEC created because of the Covid-19 pandemic to get a 45 day extension to file the annual report and said in recent SEC disclosure filings, called Form 1-U, that they promised investors to get them current revenue, cash flows, debt levels and asset values by June 12, 2020 via the annual report; but CLR has learnt that this never happened.

Adam Levin‚Äôs company has spent over two years trying to get main street to invest up to $US50 million without a successful close date that could lead to publicly traded stock on the OTC Markets under the ticker $HITM.

On June 30th, 2020 the company made an [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000149315220012247/0001493152-20-012247-index.htm) announcing once again their mini-ipo would be extended for yet another three months but left out the important fact that they couldn‚Äôt actually accept sales.

When asked if it is normal practice for a Reg A issuer to continue to solicit investments when it can‚Äôt accept sales; securities attorney Sara Hanks said:

*‚ÄùThe SEC may have softened up in the Covid crisis but previously, both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings, because there is no exemption under Reg A  for ‚Äúoffers‚Äù (advertising etc) while a company is delinquent.‚Äù*

High Times still has their investment offering page [live](https://hightimesinvestor.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=hightimesx&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3ZX4BRDmARIsAFYh7ZLylKUJKyHSWhczvAcJAdLVBjLED6hTfWbWCb4Oejeqm5j-yCs4zpgaAgzCEALw_wcB)

Since then investors have seen a rapid pace of public announcements about asset purchases, via signed letter of intents, hyping the potential growth of High Times followed up with quiet SEC filings announcing the deals had either fallen apart or been watered down. 

I have personally fallen for this sham (F), as I invested in 5000 units in 2018. They stopped responding to my inquires, in fact, there was a random charge on my credit card (from an airport in LA) the same day they charged my card for the IPO.. they stated that it would be refunded - never was. I can still log on and see the shares I have ‚Äúinvested‚Äù but they obviosuly don‚Äôt represent anything. Lesson learned..

**Recent Financials**

The company filed a[post-qualification amendment to its Form 1-A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1714420/000121390018007523/f1apos2018a1_hightimeshold.htm) with the SEC that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious. In the first quarter of 2018, sales plunged 64.9% to just $1.481 million:

Most of the decline can be attributed to the events business, which fell almost 83%, but publishing revenue declined over 16% as well. The company indicated that its Cannabis Cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year, with one in Las Vegas and in Los Angeles taking place in the first quarter of 2017 and none in the first quarter of 2018. The $554K in sales were generated by smaller events, and the company expects the number of Cannabis Cups and small events to increase for the full year. It blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue, with digital partially offsetting these factors.

The company provided information about its cost of revenue, which was $503K, as well as its operating expenses, which declined substantially to $2.391 million, producing an operating loss of $1.413 million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $6.54 million. Much of the year-ago operating expenses were due to a one-time non-cash charge of $6.689 million for equity compensation charges for consulting.

The last time the company filed official annual earnings was June 2019. High Times had told investors it would get updated financial information on June 12, but that did not happen. The company has extended the offering of shares for two years, initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the NASDAQ. Then it lowered those expectations to the Over-The-Counter Marketplace. 

**Still, it hasn‚Äôt happened.**

On the next day the eToro assistance wrote that they were going to refund traders who got their positions triggered by these SL.
Now: since I knew for sure that the stock would have plummeted for more than 25% (and fuck it did a lot more than that), and eToro assistance didn‚Äôt say a word about the SL-sh*t, I decided to close my positions at around -12/-15%, losing half of the losses I would have had only a couple hours later.
After the assistance‚Äôs announcement of the refund, I immediately contacted them, explaining my situation, and only yesterday, after a couple weeks of wait, they told me that ‚ÄòI managed to edit my SL, so they cannot refund me in any way‚Äô. 
...
WTF does that mean? Considering I didn‚Äôt edit any SL, nor I wanted to put any, and considering that they weren‚Äôt leveraged position, am I missing something? Are they right here, or should I go on, maybe with a lawsuit or something? (I put a lot of money in it, so it is worth for me to do so). 
Are there any ‚Äòlawyers‚Äô or apes expert in these kind of sh*t who can help me clear my mind?

Oh yeah, almost forgHOLDHOLDHOLDHOLDHOLD"

This is just one example of what they're doing to:

A) Hide shorts so that the public can't find the % shorted or any other information. This is highly misleading and is not aligned with the spirit of transparency we should expect.

B) Drive the price down on both AMC and GME to deceiving people into thinking that these stocks are perfectly stable and there isn't an imminent gamma squeeze.

C) Get people to bail out, and ultimately make people get bored and sell their stock. It's important to just buy and hold. The general trends for GME and AMC are almost identical - when one goes up, so does the other.

&#x200B;

Remember, every time you sell just to gain a few bucks, the hedgies are able to stretch the gamma, so there's less of a squeeze. If you want max gains and mad bananas plz hold and check back in 2069"

As you can see from my post history, I've been following this trade since Gabriel Fucking Grego, aka fraudolent company slayer, posted his short thesis on the stock. Yes the stock IS overvalued, but what isn't at the current market level? So let's look at another thing: LAWSUITS.  


This is a list of lawsuits that come up just in the first page of Google results, and many more to come since I get alerts everyday. In your experience, have you ever witnessed a stock trading during numerous lawsuits that didn't go down? What happens when the lawsuits start?

Reopening is coming. Pandemic plays are coming to close, stimmy checks are going out soon, unemployment extended to September cash is flowing and businesses are ramping up for some foot traffic like no other. 

Rumours on the street, people bought up tickets for 6 month cruises already. People are restless and tired of being stuck at home. Old boomers wanna have a good time, gay couples want to see the Caribbean, middle class America want to go somewhere warm and fun but still close to the beach. You guys know where this is going. Cruise Lines are gearing up for pent up DEMAND. 
I say we got 3 months before s h t f. reservations are up, dates have been changed but still within the regular holiday season. 

Last updated March 2.

Holland America Line extended its operations pause for all departures through April 30, including Alaska, Mexican Riviera, Pacific coast, Caribbean, Mediterranean and Canada/New England departures.

(https://www.travelpulse.com/news/cruise/surprise-cruise-bookings-continue-to-rise-for-2021.html)

Devoted cruisers are chomping at the bit to return to the seas and rivers. Their options are extremely limited this year, so many of them are making plans to sail in 2021.

And so, even despite the coronavirus pandemic, cruise companies and agency networks say bookings for 2021 are rising, giving the industry a much-needed ray of hope for recovery.

In business updates in recent weeks, both Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said 2021 bookings are ‚Äúwithin historical ranges.‚Äù In fact, NCLH President and CEO Frank Del Rio said he was ‚Äúastonished‚Äù by the booking strength.

The biggest news of this whole shebang, a couple can go 12 months with 0 yes ZERO revenue and still survive. After recent equity raises, Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Group have enough liquidity to weather up to 12 more months in an essentially zero-revenue scenario, William Blair said in a note.

https://preview.redd.it/dpx5czkdtok61.png?width=616&format=png&auto=webp&s=b75627f30b15b9f6d66c52485c86d480dd204c66

To make it short, the problem was that real rates were flying up due to improved economic circumstances and FED was seemingly welcome it. 

A few days have passed and central banks all around the world have made it clear that it was in fact, NOT WELCOME. 

Most importantly, our own FED members finally changed their tune namely with Dally here just near the close : 

>Fed's Daly On If Monetary Policy Become Less Accommodative Than Appropriate:  
>  
>\- Could Address With Tools Like Changing Maturity Of Bond Purchases  
>  
>\- Sees QE, Operation Twist As A 'First Tool'   
>  
>**- Not Discounting Use Of Yield Curve Control**

In bold this is really all we needed to hear to make me go from full gay bear to super bull. 

We have JPow Thursday who will most likely reiterate the same message Thursday 1205 pm, but given Dally's and Brainard's interventions tonight there really isn't much left to hear. Market will probably not wait for Powel. 

Real rates are already moving down showing -0.8% 10 year tips at time of writing. 

Don't wanna loose you smooth brain apes but what the fed will achieve here is further lowering the equity risk premia thus allowing NQ to keep its higher valuation despite the higher nominal rates .. for longer.

TLDR : Buy $QQQ 326 APRIL 1 or even weekly 

Incidentally you can also buy $GLD, will also work."

394,GME Direct Correlation: Crossing Option Strike Price and Immediate followup volume,2021-03-02 00:31:19,"We can all agree that most technicals are out the window. Track your MA's and MACD all you want, but unless you're day trading that ain't doing shit to tell this story right now. Today I've seen a whole new wave of people dropping pure misinformation and demonstrating an overall lack of understanding in the most basic of trading knowledge (people excited that calls expired ITM on a Monday... I'm looking at you). Instead of shunning these people away or. making them feel dumb, I wanted to take an abstract look at how this general idea could actually be a positive indicator.

I don't know shit about finance or anything along those lines, but I like looking at numbers. If you like numbers, this is for you. If you're looking for advice... I have none to offer at all.

So anyway... most people are in general agreement that the spike last week has covered by MM delta hedging. The price movement started right when the price hit $55:

https://preview.redd.it/pnhp2zkjeik61.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1308265360d3f9fea21087dd6c04df4e4f12fe7

Looking at the options chain last week (keep in mind, these numbers were taken right before close and will exclude any contracts exercised prior), there were a total of 18,610 contracts ITM at $55, or 1,861,000 shares. The volume in the proceeding 5 minutes jumped to over 4,000,000 shares.

The movement that lead up to closing saw the price touch $90. Looking at the open interest of contracts with strikes of $56 to $90, we have an additional 22,148 contract ITM (2,214,800 shares). The next candle following this trigger jumped to a volume of 18,000,000. Looking at the chart, this pattern continues with a larger-than-normal spike following each new milestone/strike price (until Friday, that is). Although a good portion of the volume was renewed hype and FOMO (with some institutional assistance al a Bruce's thesis), this is a steady pattern that indicates hedging of some degree on Wednesday and Thursday.

Now the fun part you smooth brains have been waiting for. Today, we saw similar action at $120 - once it held on the candle for a moment, there was an immediate spike to >2m in volume. At $120, there are 29,960 contracts ITM (2.9m shares).

Looking at the data from last week and this week, we see that those spikes correlate directly to the number of ITM contracts, using 2/24 as an example:

https://preview.redd.it/47fops6seik61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=99e443a21e5f186dc6b2bc30e63d98b6e83ccd04

I'll admit, this is very speculative. Although it is data driven, the sample size is too small and my patience is too thin. But using these jumps as a point of reference... we may know where to expect algo driven volume...

To recap real quick, with today's close at $120 there are 29,960 weekly contracts ITM. You'll notice these spikes correlated with 3000+ jumps in ITM open interest, meaning we'd see a spike if we cross $125 heading to $130... **OH. WAIT. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.**

Crossing this strike price directly corresponds with the jump in volume from 680k to 2.8m (again)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cspssj72fik61.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d1be76bb8607d752917c8ae8ec9129ce11cd461

https://preview.redd.it/b5t30f9yeik61.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd3ddd5af45d46eb565b32f6f0f8bfa20a67214e

**This means the next algo-driven hedging will happen on a small scale from $135-$145** (where there are an addition \~2000 contracts)... however, **THIS WILL PUSH IT TO $150**. At $150, there are another 4,000 contracts that would be ITM. Using the very smooth brained math from our table above, this would give us a 150-200% boost in volume as the $150's are hedged. Keep in mind, we'll already be at higher volume from the $140 run, so that moment will be something to behold.

**TL;DR** MY THEORY: Organically reaching new ITM strikes causes algo based hedging and an immediate spike in volume proportionate to the number of new ITM calls. Also, the domino theory is correct - based on hedging volume surrounding additional ITM options, breaking $140 should propel it to $150 which will be like dropping a match in a puddle of rocket fuel.

This isn't actual DD. Just my ADHD medication making me sexually attracted to numbers, and it helps when people watch.

Edit- spelling

ETA - I think this reflects a change in strategy overall. While this could still overlap with what some call a gamma squeeze (t+2 covering of the previous week‚Äôs ITM calls), I think they are hedging up front more aggressively... giving us Delta Squeezes instead."

TLDR;  keep in mind how the news/ media outlets focus on certain aspects of us that have become caricatures within WSB now and then notice how the aspects of us they don‚Äôt cover that really make WSB different from all other subreddits, those aspects have gone down in frequency 

This ain‚Äôt a ploy for bring the old WSB back, but just a reminder to not let them use you (us) as a means to discourage other investors or push us towards a culture that will dilute itself - where people start joining other discord‚Äôs / false Reddit‚Äôs & twitters because they all replicate WSB but we‚Äôre still the best so let‚Äôs keep it that way üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"

I want to start off this DD with the standard statements. This is not financial advice and I am NOT a financial advisor! I just really like this stock. 

Quick history lesson for you apes, Microvision is an old company, older than you (probably). These mamma jammas have been slanging since ‚Äò96. What business have they been in you may be wondering? The future mother fucker. VR, Augmented Reality, Laser Imaging. These people grew up in the ‚Äò90‚Äôs watching shit like Terminator 2, Starship Troopers, The Matrix. They watched these futuristic films and thought to get ahead of the curve and get into the business of future tech early. 

Microvision is headquartered in Washington, and as a tech company that‚Äôs a big deal. That means they aren't an overvalued silicon value trust fund baby. To viciously oversimplify what this company is vested in; their tech is applied to display applications ( Projections / VR), sensing (LiDAR), and Display and Sensing ( ??Augmented Reality?? ). 

The only application of their tech I give a single fuck about is the automotive sensing. Sure VR is great for when I‚Äôm watching my Brazzers and I really want to feel like I‚Äôm getting laid since I am too afraid to go outside or talk to people in the real world, but on a large scale economic evaluation the VR industry is a moot point. 

$TSLA (Shameless papa Elon Simp) is arguably the best current automotive manufacturer on the planet. Every other automotive manufacturer is looking to take some pointers from them and start down their own path of autonomous driving. When it comes to autonomous driving there are 3 different types of technology that can be used to achieve this. Camera sensors, Radar sensors, and LiDAR sensors. Please go through this informative piece to educate yourself on autonomous driving you silly mongoloid.

TL&DR : Of the three major sensors, LiDAR is the best in terms of quality of sensing, but the drawback to this technology is the cost of use. When it comes to LiDAR there are two major types of sensor arrays, ones that spin and move a bunch and ones that don‚Äôt. Can you guess which ones would be more preferred by an automobile manufacturer? \*\*\* hint it doesn't move \*\*\*

Microvision has released a statement that it is now able to build a stationary LiDAR sensor around a sub-$1000 price point and this sensor will meet all of the specifications set by car manufacturers.

On Feb 15 Ford dissolved their stake in a different LiDAR company, Velodyne. Coincidence ? I think not. This tells us two very important things about this tech and the direction of the automotive industry. First, automotive manufacturers see the value in LiDAR as the technology of choice for autonomous vehicles. Next, they are positioning themselves well ahead of the curve to be seeded in the correct positions to win.

In addition to all of the big arrows pointing towards this company to be the chosen one for autonomous driving sensors, Seval Oz ( a bad bitch who is a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry ) has just joined the Board of Directors for this company.

MVIS was just officially granted a patent on it‚Äôs tech. On April 4, 2021 automotive manufacturers will  finally be able to get their hands on these sensors and (assuming they meet all OEM requirements like they already said they can) MVIS is more than well positioned to be the LiDAR company of choice for all automotive manufacturers looking to enter the autonomous driving industry. As manufacturers they have already shown their investments into this technology will come early and fast. It is impossible for anyone to predict if the company will be acquired or if they will lease/partner up, but all the information points to the rapid success of MVIS in the automotive sensors industry.  With all that being said I just really like the stock. MVIS go moon."
