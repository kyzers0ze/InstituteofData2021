15,Charles Schwab is hiding a giant ball of shit and won't come out and say what happened. How big is the ball of shit?,2021-02-28 00:53:32,"Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.

I'm just here to tell you the story.

This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)

Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.

Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:

* Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume.
* U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE)
* Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post)
* Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved.
* Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?)
* 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5

**= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""

Important points:

1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue.
2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks.
3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018)
4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...

It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.

**Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**

Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.

16,GME IS A MEME STOCK,2021-02-28 09:51:26,"I’ve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I’m just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...

Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING

Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn’t matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. 

Longer version:

There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. 

GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It’s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn’t matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. 

GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s why we can do this. You don’t need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn’t new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won’t lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. 


Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don’t remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. 

I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It’s what hedge funds are doing. It’s all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. 

Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don’t look for a made up catalyst. It’s right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don’t underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. 

I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God’s work (not religious just an expression). I’ll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). 

This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that’s interpretation. 

I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!

I hope all newcomers see this...

Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how “GameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that’s why shorties keep coming back to ‘squeeze’” but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!

Whenever you are confused and dissuaded by all the misinformation, come back here or speak my name. I’ll be there to put you back on the right path."

26,Do NOT give into pessimism -&gt; we’re too DEEP to pull our figurative dick out,2021-02-27 21:43:25,"Been seeing a lot of comments in the past few days, “What’re the chances this is actually going to work?”-esq questions. Look, I’m not going to make you wrong for asking these types of questions because they are rational questions - but WSB wasn’t founded on rationality - it was founded on YOLOing our children’s college funds away and making memes about it. This is a MOONSHOT; not a sure bet - if you can’t handle the fire get out of the kitchen (aka sub to r/investing and get a nice safe index fund).

Here are the facts -&gt; They NEED our shares. We are seeing them BLATANTLY use every trick in the book (naked shorts, keeping prices artificially low, blocking trading, etc) - in fact, they’re not even pretending or hiding it anymore. It’s out in the public - anyone who cares to see it can see it. But here’s the thing: despite all their tricks, at the end of the day - they still NEED our shares. At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand. They want us to get bored and sell - behind all their dirty tricks, it sums up to them just trying to get us to sell - either through fear or boredom. Do what you got to do - but I am holding until the bitter fucking end.

Tldr; don’t get fatigue/boredom/fear from this - that’s what they want. Take time away and come back fresh. And most importantly - HOLD

Edit: Include specific location of Articuno’s YOLO spot

Edit 2: change “short ladder attack” to “keep prices artificially low” herp derp"
27,Shorts are literally running out of bullets.,2021-02-27 17:35:00,"Hi fellow retards!

My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they’ve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation. 

As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they’re trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they’re selling off their valuable possessions. So they can’t borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they’re selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don’t give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost. 

The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves. 

Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they’ll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that’s my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov’t. Not only that but now they’re on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I’m sorry.

TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities. 

My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I’d be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn’t financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks."

37,"(GME DD) Why the Volkswagen Comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought, but in A DIFFERENT WAY",2021-02-27 18:36:58,"Hey folks!
I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.

Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:

So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101).
I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:




TL;DR:
You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.



Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic.
Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:

you start with ~0~ shares
you borrow one from a broker
you now have ~1~ shares
you sell that share, completing your short
you now have ~0~ shares

Now imagine the short squeeze happens.
And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc.
The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).

Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high:
Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital. 
You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.

you start with ~0~ shares
you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker!
you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe”
you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!

Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with! 
Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value: 

THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO
The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?

Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy.
Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.


If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations.
Now think about that again.


Effective TL;DR 2.0:

People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule?
Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.

But here’s MY question:
What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it? 
VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.


Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not.
Joy to all,

39,To all of you apes that consider buying into GME but hesitate because you want to find the perfect entry point,2021-02-27 11:31:33,"You will NEVER find it... that‘s just how it is. Believe it or not, but finding the perfect entry and perfect exit point is pure luck.

So you can wait and hope for GME to dip some more so you can buy in more cheaply, but chances are at least as high that it takes off soon 🚀🚀🚀 and you missed your chance - thinking „I wish I bought in @100 rather than @250+.“

What you learn from that? Well assuming you believe that GME has a solid chance of reaching 1‘000$ and more, it simply does not matter whether your entry point was @100 or @80 or @150.

Tldr: You will not find it, so just BUY while it still is in the 2-3 digit range (Edit: given that you believe in this rocket)! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

42,"When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next.",2021-02-27 23:13:01,"I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.

By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.

Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/

First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! 

Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. 

Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. 

By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.

Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.

When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.

UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!

Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.

Space Ape out

TLDR: 

* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU
* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI
* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot
* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds
* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon

this in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don’t believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.

Why does this even matter? It’s because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the ‘failure to deliver’ system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more... 

Think about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It’s because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn’t sell when it went down why? Well it’s simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. 

Now back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen’s and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF’s as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that’s our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it’s a great time to be alive!

And although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won’t be able to be deductible since it’s made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it’s corruption vs the people. Unity will prevail if we stay strong together 💎

52,Shorting Robinhood IPO - self fulfilling prophecy?,2021-02-28 06:13:37,"With the crazy large amount of disdain towards robinhood, and now they are still confident continuing with IPO, just wondering what can a group of people do to best boycott em and make impact?

Consider a hypothethical scenario where a company is shorted to all hell after IPO by a mass of angry mob. And consider if on top of that, there have been so many discussions and threads about shorting it after IPO, and it had reached the media and media started reporting that a large, large amount of people will short the company after IPO, scaring every single instutional investor into investing in the first place. What would it mean to the company? It means goodbye see ya never.

I think it can be a self fulfilling prophecy. Market these days are based on sentiment, and if theres so many upvoted threads popping about shorting the company before IPO and it reaches the media and the media starts reporting it, its game over for them. Potential investors will be wary to enter, and new retail investors wont even sign up new accounts in the first place.

Edit: as pointed out by u/treehugchamp shorting has its risks. So discuss, what would be the best way to cause a big impact. Shorting and buying calls? Buying puts? Box spread quad witching? How do we really, really, really, fuck em up?

Some people believe that karma comes to those who deserve it. My belief is that we, both individually and as a group, have the choice to be agents of said karma, and can expedite the process."

59,Is $PLTR still a Buy after insider stock sell off?,2021-02-28 03:50:17,"Palantir Technologies’ 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter came in well above prior expectations and management’s guidance. The company is also benefiting from the transition to a software-based firm and its efforts to more efficiently deliver and scale its products.

 

In the quarter, government sales increased by 85% and commercial revenue grew by 4% year over year. While commercial growth was slower than anticipated, Palantir’s 2021 focus of expanding its direct sales force and channel partnerships to accelerate this segment. Palantir is showing strong momentum with growing sales and margins with its existing customer base, diversification among its revenue streams, and ability to land new clients. Average revenue per customer increased by 41% year over year to $7.9 million. Annual revenue from top 20 customers increased by 34% year over year to $663 million, while the customer concentration from those top 20 customers declined to 61%.from 67% the year before. Palantir closed more than 21 deals in the quarter worth at least $5 million, with 10 of those worth at least $10 million. Adjusted gross and operating margins of 84% (81% last quarter) and 32% (25% previous quarter), respectively, were ahead of our prior expectations as revenue outpaced expenses, Palantir lowered its cloud hosting costs, and go to market efficiency gains are decreasing upfront software deployment costs.




Palantir is well suited to help organizations consolidate and harness the power of data. Between a leading position in the government sector with the U.S. and its allies and the opportunity for Palantir to expand into commercial enterprise applications, this narrow-moat company is poised for robust growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. The uncovering of insights and the easy integration of data is a largely untapped market due to legacy data sets saved around the world, various data formats, the uptick in cloud-based resources, and the proliferation of the need for real-time access via distributed devices. 



Palantir established itself by working with the U.S. government intelligence and defense sectors to integrate military data into a consolidated dashboard, and then drove actionable outcomes by uncovering hidden patterns with artificial intelligence support. Its Gotham software platform is used across various government sectors within the U.S. and among its allies.



Palantir sells its Foundry software platform to commercial organizations, targeting large-scale data operations. Holistically combining data has typically involved consulting alongside in-house customized development efforts for enterprises; however, Palantir's commercial offering is attempting to change the industry's procurement motion. Its software is used in a variety of industries and Palantir's aim is to be the data operating system for companies and industries. By stitching together various seemingly disparate components of the airline industry, as one example, Palantir has made inroads to become a data platform standard for the industry, and looks to other industries to achieve similar results. 



Tldr; 

 Palantir could be the answer to the problems that governments and commercial customers face in successfully integrating large-scale, disparate data in a cohesive and coherent manner to gain insight and drive actions. Palantir has a strong government business and is diversifying into potentially higher-margin commercial markets; it could become the data operating system for companies and industries. The company has substantial margin expansion opportunities via improvements in deployment costsband by offering commercially available solutions to prospects.

62,New Video from Bruce Frommert describes what he thinks is going on in GME. Worth a watch. tldr in post.,2021-02-27 14:30:52,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello beautiful apes.

For those of you so smooth-brained that you've not heard of Uncle Bruce, then allow me to use my tastiest crayon to enlighten you. Stock Markets with Bruce has been a stalwart of the GME saga and the old silverback has been live streaming throughout the whole damn thing. The guy deserves all the support and praise you can give him.

Onto his DD, go to the youtube channel 'Stock Markets With Bruce' and view the video 'GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On! Stock Markets In Plain English'. I can't link it sadly.

**tldr**; Hedgefunds with short positions are buying 2x(numOfShorts) call options deep in the money to not only cover their short positions, but then end up long GME. There are more calls available than tradable stock (due to naked call contracts) and thus they can then join-in the diamond hand rocket while the Chicago Market Makers (options writers) have to scramble around trying to buy more stock than exists. All this while the newly longed HF's slowly leak shares to the MM's at ever increasing prices.

Does this mean the shorts are now coming in to bat for us? I'm more than happy for smart money to yeet this thing to the moon, I'm here for tendies, nothing more, nothing less.

If I've wrongly interpreted the DD and you've been triggered, first well done for watching Bruce's video, give him a thumbs up while you're there. Second, don't get angry at me, hate yourself for taking financial advice from an ape on the internet. P.S. If you are my wife's BF then I'm sorry... I don't know what for, I just am.

My position: long 11.57 GME @ $105

Credit goes to Bruce Frommert, of Stock Markets With Bruce. If you feel enlightened and want to share some love, please direct it at him!

Edit: obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**tldr for the tldr**: This thing is now decided by the options market. Hodl

**Edit**: This post blew up more than I expected. Thanks for the kind words and support! I've never received rewards before for a post so feel very humbled. Please credit Bruce before me though, I'm just the retarded ape messenger 😀"

65,"Dear Apes, why was Rocket’s dividend strategy genius? I’ll try to dumb it down for you fuck tards.",2021-02-27 18:18:41,"Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰

Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:

When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.

RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself). 

$RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back. 

It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT. 

BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?

GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you. 

The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.

Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November. 

Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.

BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:

Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?



TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌

69,$AMC Cup and Handle Formation,2021-02-28 01:59:20,"So when the cup began forming, it retraced approximately 50% (which given the volatility is totally understandable).  The bottom of the cup was rather smooth, indicating a strong period of consolidation and accumulation.  The cup formation also began immediately after a new trend (the boom up), meaning it's a strong contender for a continuation of the previous trend if the cup completes.

In order for the cup to complete, the price needs to rise above the neckline, which is about $10-11 area.  If this happens, chartists and algo buyers will see the buy signal and volume should come in.

What time period are we looking at?  I'd say we have till Friday to get it to the neckline.  If enough contracts are executed Monday, we could see enough volume to get there.

There's also the issue of the gap to fill from the sell off from Feb 2.  The area ranges from $10-$15, giving us further reason for an increase in price.  If we do, the breakout in price should occur from there.

Positions: March 5 $15 calls and missionary with the HF's wife.

TLDR/eat crayons:  Stock price needs to get to $11 within next few days to trigger boomer astrologists and robot programs in to mindlessly purchasing.  More buyers = higher price.

This Does not mean that the upcoming price will skyrocket like it did in January. It is only a comparison of the volume with the open and closing prices. 

This is also not financial advice and I am not telling you to buy, sell or hold. 

To any journalists/reporters that reads these threads and wants to claim that this price movement is due to a bunch of retail investors I would like to respond with a healthy FUCK YOU and that you should know better that the amount of volume that is happening is not because of the retards here.

And so... should we retards dump our stocks now?

In addition:Last summer after the economy crashed, the price of crude oil (WTI) was **under $40** a barrel.  Now it is **over $60** a barrel for a **50% increase.**  And yet the stock prices of oil and gas firms are **flat**!?!

First of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.

But seriously, I'm here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven't paid attention to their membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use their membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.

When it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What's the membership do.

It's 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.

I felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.

But the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.

Granted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but their membership program change is working.

I commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.

TLDR: felt like the new membership program was 🔥, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.

101,GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market. I did some research &amp; analysis.,2021-02-27 02:44:52,"Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!

**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.

New York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings

Nasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&amp;P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).

Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)

**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.

**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.

**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\*\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\*\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)

**START**

I noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I’ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)

If you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested.

**PROCESS**

I calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Covariance &amp; Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)

[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)

The results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance”. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to “luck”. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.

**So, what does this mean?**

**My opinions.**

To me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.

My opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.

**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**

Anyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.

I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR

**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much

I also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of ""correlation does not imply causation"". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **""strength""** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term ""significant"" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little ""\*"" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims "" helps turn food into cellular energy\*"" while other vitamins make claims with no ""\*"".

In layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.

Also, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.

So with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.

Lastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.

Other than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!

**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.

[u\/big\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)

For those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.

**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields. If you do decide to provide suggestions if you could list them in stepwise instructions that would be even better. **Pointing out problems/faults is important, but providing actionable solutions even more so!**"

**Last week’s 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA 
**Last week’s losers: BIDU XPEV**

**On a milk carton but our family still has hope**: JD

*I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I’m playing.* 

****

When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.

**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day. 

Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.

****

**1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**

On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.

I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.

Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**

It was time to get to work.

****

**2.	The investigation**

I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.

1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.

2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.

*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. 

*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*

These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".

****

**3.	Defining RAMBO**

As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**

I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.

**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**

****

**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** 

**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**

**My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. 

**5. So what am I saying?**

I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.

**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**

[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.

The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.

You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.

As always pick a good entry point.

[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright 

Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:

&gt;BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.
A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.

Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.

[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬 

CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).

Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.

**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble

****

**TLDR**:
Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.

I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special dates"

Hello again my fellow apes🦍!

BOILERPLATE: I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀

WARNING: BY THE END OF THIS POST YOU MAY EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS EUPHORIA OR PREMATURE 🚀 SYNDROME. THESE ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF 'CONFIRMATION BIAS'. TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR TO LEARN MORE.

[Yesterday I put together this analysis and everyone really liked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn7ke/finra_data_now_shows_over_58_million_gme_stocks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so I have updated to include today’s data and some new data sources (availability and fees for shorts). Enjoy this *light* weekend reading 😉

\------------

**Part 1: FINRA**

I put together the FINRA daily short data for the last week and you can see an increase in short volume over the last 6 days! [http://regsho.FINRA.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html) (@CultureCrypto sent me this link that had the data in a much more friendly fashion [https://www.FINRA.org/FINRA-data/short-sale-volume-daily](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily))

(Note: if you want to find this raw data, use the link above and you will need to go into each day's file (updated at 6pm daily) and search for GME, then copy the raw numbers. the top of the document will show you what each number corresponds to - this is not a user-friendly document)

There was an additional **22 million** in short volume today, on top of the **33m yesterday and 12m Wednesday**. While this is a decrease in absolute shorts from yesterday, volume also decreased proportionally so it is still identical short volume to total volume ratio.

The short volume as % of total daily volume, as published by FINRA, is at **57**% which is the same levels that we saw on Jan 27-29 when there was a concerted effort to bring down the share price.

**CAVEATS:**

* This data does not include NYSE, which is why total volume for today is 38M but actual total vol is 90 million. Thanks to u/tri_fire_engineer for bringing this up. He has posted the full data for yesterday down in the comments and it actually showed that **once NYSE data was included, Short Volume % went up from 56.8% to 57.6%. I think this shows that while the FINRA data is just a sample, its large enough to be considered representative of the full marke**t
* **daily data does NOT equate to % of total shares that are shorted,** as the same share could be shorted multiple time and there are other thing that lenders do which could be considered 'shorting' but is not what we would usually define. The best data is the monthly FINRA data but that only comes out once a month and that doesn't sound very fun.

Here are my data tables, again all taken from the FINRA daily data.

**Assumptions used:**

GME Float Stock: 54,490,000 (this is more pessimistic than some reports of only 45M)

GME Total Shares: 69,750,000

https://preview.redd.it/2lpie1wm12k61.png?width=807&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=450f545a8b2e00b3876d9efc406fba5032fa8a74

The FINRA site also now lists GME short % of float at **60.35%** ( [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0) ) Thanks to u/wrek for sending this!

\----------

**Part 2: Borrowing Shares**

Two other things to note are the decrease in available shorted shares and the increase in fees associated with shorting GME.

The data available through iborrowdesk.com ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) ). For those wondering about the site, check out the about page; the site uses text files from Interactive Broker’s FTP site ([https://iborrowdesk.com/about](https://iborrowdesk.com/about) ).

Note: This data does not take into account all available shorts since it is just looking at Interactive Broker, but is a good gauge for how easy it is to get shorts and how much they cost.

https://preview.redd.it/roplc5ly12k61.png?width=1198&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a592938458cf6436e64ef2655b0bf193bfc6e9

Here we can see that the number of shares available for short selling has gone from **2 million (at 1.1% borrow rate) to only 450,000 at 9% borrow rate**! The last time there were less than 500,000 shares available to borrow and interest rates above 5% (as seen through this site) was on **Jan 27** when we saw some huge intraday price swings.

\----------

**Part 3: ETFs**

This data of course doesn't take into account the shorted shares in ETFs that have high stakes in GME. For example, 'EX AR TEE' is currently 175% shorted (16.1m shares on 9.2m) and GME as 9% of its portfolio.

[https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/)

Doing some quick math of \~$73M of GME at $117 = 620k shares of GME x 185% short position = \~1.1m GME shares shorted.

https://preview.redd.it/449mbia022k61.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=945faea5d149afac977bcc480592b3bdbf4d5274

[https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/](https://www.etfchannel.com/article/202102/xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-large-outflows-detected-at-etf-xrt-gme-mgni-ostk-XRT02192021.htm/)

They have even published an article singling out this ETF because there is a huge outflow of shares being dissolved (ie shorted).

&gt;“…we have detected an approximate $85.8 million dollar outflow -- that's a 12.0% decrease week over week (from 9,200,000 to 8,100,000).”

If these numbers are true, then it is shorted closer to 199%! (16.1m shorts / 8.1m shares).

NOTE: you cannot squeeze an ETF as it is just a collection of shares, the fund can increase and decrease the total number of shares it owns as the size of the fund grows / shrinks. this is why the article above was talking about an outflow of money from the ETF

\----------

**TLDR:**

THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO STOP THIS ROCKET JUST LIKE LAST TIME, BUT **💎🙌** 💎 will prevail!!!

**Stake:** shares in GME **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**

**PS:** you guys! I’m truly honored by how popular you’ve made my posts! You are the best online anonymous friends an 🦍 could ever want! I’ll continue to post updates on this data next week :)

For those interested, here is some more info from FINRA about this data:

""The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.""

108,DD: PRO's are buying GME on this date.....this is the way GME,2021-02-28 06:22:50,"\*This is not financial advice and I’m not a licensed or registered securities analyst/provider. Basically, I know nothing so do listen to me. Just some context to what is happing and a guess on what the Pro's will do as they continue to manipulate GME.

Difference between Options and betting on a football game. Betting on a football game doesn’t affect the outcome. If enough people buy call options it can affect the outcome.

**Conclusion: Pro’s will BANG THE CLOSE on Thursday March 18th for April 1 Call options**

Apparently, the Pro’s are buying call option positions at the close somewhat near where the stock is trading (at the money) causing the market makers to delta hedge (estimated .66) and buy shares in the open market. For every contract (100 shares) the market makers sell at the money (near current price), they will need to hedge by buying about .66 (delta) shares on the open market. Buying pressure can increase the price sparking more interest (feedback loop).This is how the bet influences the outcome. This is the way.

The last two months they did it in the last trading week of the month. I’m thinking they could disguise their intent by executing their strategy the week before GME reports Q4 earnings. They haven’t been waiting til Friday so my guess is it would take place earlier maybe on Wednesday or Thursday. Friday the 19th is Quadruple Witching day so volatility in the overall market will be higher.

BANG THE FORUM would also fuel the rocketship. Hedge Funds are spying on the reddit forum (Point 2). They have programs to scrape every letter on this forum and calculate sentiment.  I could see them buying contracts and faking an increase in sentiment by posting the letters GME in a lot of replies so it looks like [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) are about to go gang busters on GME. If the letters GME show up in many post replies then everyone will be thinking that redditors are about to buy a lot of GME. The idiot hedge funds will go out and buy stock/options to front run the retail investor. If the [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) crowd also included “GME” in replies it could further fuel it as the Pro’s manipulate the market. This is the way.

[**Point 0: Movement in GME is repeatable (feedback loop)**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/25/nothing-specific-caused-gamestop-rally-says-strategist.html?&amp;qsearchterm=Nothing%20specific%20caused%20GameStop%20rally)

(click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)

Catalyst relatively simple (feedback loop)….we started to tick up on Thursday and got above $50. THEN major option trades went off fueling the rocketship to the moon! Parabolic!!

2:58pm stock at $53, 750 contracts at $50 strike expire tomorrow (1 day) paid $6.85 (about $500k). Within 10 mins stock at $68 or so and not long later dropped to $60

3:27pm stock at $60.80, 400 contracts at $60 strike $7.75 (about $300k)

(Feedback loop) People on the other side of the trade (sellers of contracts) have to hedge and buy shares. Craziness will happen with only 20 minutes left to the close. All this from ONLY $800k in call option activity!! That’s nothing….a little skeptical.

[**Point 1: SEC former regulator foreshadows next squeeze (End of March)**](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/26/there-are-institutional-traders-behind-gamestop-frenzy-former-sec-regulator.html)

(click up here \^\^\^ for CNBC video \^\^\^)

First Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the January

Second Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the February (not as many short sellers)

Projected Third Short Squeeze…. Last trading week of the March (huge month for trade, month and quarter end)

**Point 2: Hedge Funds spying on** [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)\*\*, use it against them\*\*

Investors (HF’s, Institutions, etc.) are paying service providers to spy on the forum and count everytime someone mentions Gamestop or the ticker. They are tracking the sentiment of the forum to front run the action. If you talk about Gamestop a lot and type in the ticker then each mention gets counted and if there is a significant increase then the HF’s may consider buying the stock and/or options to participate in any increase before it goes parabolic.

**Point 3: Q4 2020 earnings expected to be out in “late March”**

I expect the earnings date will be announced two weeks prior, so that puts you around March 8th Monday to March 11th Thursday. Earnings date probably between 23rd to the 25th, two weeks after the announcement of the date.

11/24/2020 (Tuesday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/08/2020 (Tuesday)

08/26/2020 (Wednesday) GME announces Q2 earnings release on 09/09/2020 (Wednesday)

05/28/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q1 earnings release on 06/09/2020 (Tuesday)

03/12/2020 (Thursday) GME announces Q4 earnings release on 03/26/2019 (Thursday)

11/25/2019 (Monday) GME announces Q3 earnings release on 12/10/2019 (Tuesday)

**Point 4: Options Cubed - GME is spring loaded for volatility**

The somewhat binary outcome of survive or die combined with a very credible activist investor (Ryan C.) is accelerated with material changes and establishing a better alignment with the secular tailwinds of gaming.

Buying call options is like an option on an option on an option, Options Cubed. For that reason, you would expect them to be priced accordingly. However, even after the first squeeze massively help by the short sellers, we sat in the $40-$60 range with out of the money call options price extremely cheap. As if they were normal options. Let’s see how cheaply someone is willing to sell a $70 call option if this stock tanks to the $50s next week.

**Point 5: Probability says buy April 1 Call options**

You don’t know when the parabolic moves will happen but the media clips above in point 2 suggest it will happen in the last week of the month. Since you don’t know when, the task is the following:

Detail Outcomes --&gt; Assign Probabilities (subjective) --&gt; Calculate Expected Value

Lets say next week GME drops to the $50-$60 range and out of the money call options are cheap like the aftermath of the first squeeze.

15x return --&gt; 10% chance of another move just simply to $100 (a $60 Strike call option would be worth about $45 to $60 with a stock price move to $100 again)

0x return --&gt; 90% chance we never get above $50 again

Expected Value = (15x \* .1) + (0x \* .9) = 1.5x return

On average a 50% return is expected. So if you think there is a greater than 10% chance of another move to $100 once it falls to the $50-$60 range then the expected return only goes up assuming you can get at least a 15x return on your contract."

115,GME reversal has already happened and HF's are giggling? Thoughts?,2021-02-28 05:53:40,"🚀🚀🚀So Bruce put out a good theory on how a short reversal could have already happened without anyone even realizing. I found it to be pretty interesting and completely possible.

Basically the🚀 idea is to purchase deep in the money call options to force option writers to sell you stocks which you can then use to cover your own shorts with. This would simultaneo🚀usly create a squeeze as the options writers tried to cover these options. Bruce postulates that they could  also accrue more call options than their short 🚀position and then ride the squeeze with the excess shares they have and slowly sell back the excess during the squeeze.   Basically the squeeze would be from naked option writers rather than shorts and no one would even realize because it would be going through option writers rather than the open market.

🚀In his reasoning I specifically questioned the buying of a bunch of deep in the money calls because I would think the total costs of premiums would outweigh the gains in his specific example unless the price was to rocket afterwards 🚀but my understanding is admittedly smooth brained.

Any one here with a few wrinkles that have some thoughts on this? Would love to discuss.

Even if you're not interested the video is still a good watch 🚀🚀

You can U-tube ""Stocks Markets with Bruce"" for his entire explanation since the automo apparently hates links. Its the most recent vid on his channel.🚀

Edit - Ok you apes, I'm not pushing one thing or the other, in fact even if the idea is true it still means a squeeze is coming its just coming from naked options rather than naked shorts. and would mean that option writers are the bag holders instead of the HF's. You smooth brains need to chill out with the hate messages and downvotes because you think I'm trying to sabotage shit. SMH. 🚀🚀🚀

That's about to change drastically. This morning, Berkshire Hathaway beat Q4 EPS consensus by 42.3%, said they repurchased $24.7 billion in shares in 2020, and planned to continue the record pace of repurchases this year ([2](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2020ar/linksannual20.html)). In addition, Buffett laid out his bullish case for BRK as usual in his annual letter. However, more important than any of these things (as significant as they are) is what was missing from the letter this year.

As many of you rightfully complain, Buffett has failed to find elephant deals for many years. He's complained himself about this every year and warned every year that BRK will lag SPY in the short term. In the meantime, he's fiddled with new ways to put the cash to use with sector bets on airlines, banks, japanese conglomerates, etc. With this backdrop, remember that Buffett is not a boomer, he's from the Silent Generation. So, what he didn't say in the report is really important. 

So what the fuck didn't he say? He didn't complain at all about not knowing what to do with cash and didn't warn that BRK might lag SPY. You're not grasping the significance yet. Let me explain.

The reason he's been fiddling with sector bets is because these are his replacement for the elephants. In fact, he explains in his letter linked above that they're even better. He no longer needs to pay a control premium to own them. Plus he can buy into better businesses that are too valued by their shareholders to be sold entirely to any one owner.

Over the next year, the market will transition from an easy money market to one where economic principles and free cash flows matter. There's no one more adept at navigating such markets than Warren and his colossal BRK cash machine.

Also, here's some simple math for you. SP500 P/E ratio: 38.8. BRK P/E ratio: 13.5. [Yes, I included unrealized capital gains in calculating BRK's P/E. That's because BRK's portfolio is actively managed and it is part of their business model and reported net income.] This means BRK's underperformace relative to SPY lately was due to earnings multiple contraction in BRK while SPY experienced multiple expansion!

This is why Buffett didn't warn that BRK might underperform. He's back in his mojo and about to whoop SPY's ass again. Boomers will wake up to this next week and push up BRK's multiple again.

124,Here's why I think the correction is over and we rise Monday,2021-02-27 16:07:00,"TLT has bottomed and is seemingly bouncing of the support. This will bring down the yield, thus making growth and equities attractive again

Friday we saw yields going down significantly. This only makes me convinced 1.5 on 10Y is the resistance. What made people buy bonds? I think the market correction made money flow into bonds again as it is a safe haven asset class, even on current levels. Paradoxically, we might see this movement between bonds and equities oscillate for a few more weeks violently, before it settles on a level

$1.9T stimulus is already priced in and it won't be factor affecting the current market. However, any deviation from this figure might have an impact. If it is greater than $1.9T, bonds are sold on fears of inflation, thus driving up the yield. And vice versa. A greater stimulus can also makes TLT drop below support which would be scary and not what we want.

Lastly, Fed for sure is monitoring the movement in the long dated yield. They have consistently mentioned that inflation is not an issue long term and that they still have enough tools at their disposal to control the yield curve. In case yields break off and go above 1.5 parabolically, I think they will jump in and start participating in buying the long dated bonds, which they haven't done yet - they have only been buying the short dated bonds so far.

Why would Fed want to control the long dated yield? To save the stock market? Nope. That's not their primary goal, but equities do benefit from their measure. They will buy long dated bonds because they want more borrowers in the economy than lenders. Especially given the fact their target is to boost employment, which would happen if they keep companies afloat - yes, even the zombie ones, which should ideally go out of business anyway. But that's a concern for the future. At this point, Fed is least bothered about this particular underlying problem."

https://globalfinancialdata.com/eddie-gilbert-the-boy-wonder-of-wall-street#:~:text=On%20June%2012%2C%201958%2C%20the,remaining%2050%25%20of%20Bruce%20stock.

Gilbert began buying up shares of Bruce in February 1958 at 16.875 to acquire majority ownership of the company. As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.

The remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.

Saunders vs. the Shorts
Clarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.  
The Shorts Are Cornered
Piggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.  
Saunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory
On Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall.

In 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.

Morgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.

On Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.

Suddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.

By noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.

Kuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.

The New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.

Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.

At that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.

VW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.

The share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.

In March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.

“The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.

“In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”

Meanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.

Porsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.

“We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”

Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.

It said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”

Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.

The “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.

Dealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.

“Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.

Shares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.

Goldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.

VOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING?
Shares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.

This meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.

Analysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.

“The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.

Despite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.

But Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.

When asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”

The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.

Philip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.

He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.

In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.

Poor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.

It is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.

As for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.

In hockey, this is called sportsmanship.

Falcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.

Falcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)

This move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.

That’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.

Now, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.

The SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.

“Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.

I, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.

“Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.

https://nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/

After nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.

The embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.

But Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.

Herbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.

The rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.

Among those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.

“There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.

Instead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.

Unlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”

Nevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.

Ackman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.

“Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.

Pershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.

But that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.

“We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.

Herbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.

Pershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.

Reps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.

Herbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.

The Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.

At the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.

With all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.

Now for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.

Now imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda:
“Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.”
This is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.

Already, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.

Watching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.

Little did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned.
Within the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.

Daniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.

From The Great Game:

“Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”

Interestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”

Despite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”

Fortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.

“The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another. Indeed, for a full generation on Wall Street, the phrase, ‘short of Harlem’, meant much the same thing as ‘up the creek’”"
131,"Still puzzled by the buy restriction, especially the timing",2021-02-28 01:15:31,"I have no direct evidence but there are coincidence and conflict so I would like to straight it out as a reference for the once in history event.

A little background first.

* 1/13/2021 - 1/27/2021, GME price went from \~20 to \~350.
* 1/28/2021 Robinhood implemented buy restriction on GME. This restriction was fully removed on 2/5 (**Friday**). 7 trading days but 9 days include weekend. In between there were partial restriction that is almost the same as full restriction.
* During that time period, GME closed down on 1/28, but higher on 1/29 (Friday). Big drops for the next 4 days (Mon - Thur) from \~350 to \~53. The next day they fully removed the buy restriction, and the price went up to \~63. That's **Friday**.

&amp;#x200B;

I was puzzled by the timing.

* The **up trend** is still intact up to 1/29, the second day into restriction even though there was big drop the day before, when the buy restriction was implemented. If the restriction was removed then the up trend would most likely still in place, even enhanced.

1. Several other platform had restriction on 1/28 but no more the next day (Please help to verify this). Why R still has the restriction?
2. News reported that R **raised 1B on 1/29, and another 2.4B on 2/1 (Monday when another big drop happened). If there restriction was based on the capital requirement by DTCC, would this 3.4B more than enough to fulfill that requirement(&lt;1B as we now know)?** Why did they still keep that restriction? Earlier that week citadel provided 2B bailout to short seller Melvin.

* The **down trend** starting from 2/1 lasted 4 days until 2/4 Thursday. The big drop on 2/4 knocked GME from 91 to 53. At this point if it went down even more( 35 level on the left side plateau) it would likely bounce back hard from there. **The more the compress, the more the explosion power.** The restriction was **fully removed on 2/5 the next day Friday**. It was perceived as a good news but people tend to be cautious during Friday because of uncertainty of weekend. This seems to be calculated, well timed action to reduce big swing. The price had relatively small bounce back, which slowed the downward pressure but at the same time released the explosive power from the compression."

133,Why I think GME will never go below 45$ again.,2021-02-27 12:19:42,"After the first godly squeeze in January and the artificial fall, I and I’m sure many other apes felt that we lost the fight (war or whatever you want to call it). A few weeks go by and the stock keeps falling slowly but surely which led the majority if us to believe it is a thing of the past. Many analysis and DDs and news showed that shorting went down to 60% (from over 100%) so everything seemed negative for us average rookie investors (which im sure is the majority). Keeping in mind I am now bag holding my 87% loss and thinking it is not even worth selling anymore so might as well forget it about it (diamond hands but it was very sad hands).

Moving to the present, all the ape shit that happened starting with the hearing, DFV doubling down and stock rocketing. I averaged down to 130$ from 270$, which was an easy decision for me so I’m thinking it was the same for people in my position.

I was watching the stock yesterday at 101$ and the ask was soooo not random as notmally it is because they were thousands of calls in 101.xxx which is what I guess what reddit calls a ladder attack. And the shares being borrowed and now it makes sense to me what they are doing!!! Which im sure everyone like myself with a smooth brain finally understand on some level the game!!!

So now I’m thinking since I have 5 times bigger bag at 130$ average, and other apes that did the same thing own more stocks of GME, plus we are optimistic now. As a result this means we will be holding the line stronger than the first time, so it shouldn’t go below the 45$ margin which it was at in the weeks after the first fall.

P.S. this is obviously not financial advice, and obviously you could tell I’m so bad at stock analysis and math. This is just how I am feeling right now and what my smooth brain concluded.

Anyone else feels the same way?"

135,My doctor wishes us retards the best of luck,2021-02-26 19:53:04,"This post will probably get buried, but whatever, it's funny.

I went into get tested for Covid this afternoon after being exposed, nothing special. But I'm also buying dips on AMC at the same time and as a result, almost missed my name being called multiple times by the receptionist when my turn was ready. Tunnel vision is real.

I get the swab and chat with the doc for a minute or two about all the Covid craziness and just overall life shit. He's a cool guy, super laid back and what not, and after a bit he steps out to go find my results. I'm chillin in the exam room, waiting for my results and of course, I'm still on my apps, just habitually watching the price and debating if I should go in on some more or not. About five or six minutes go by when my doctor returns with results. I didn't realize he could see the basic idea of what I was doing on my phone (price-watching etc) and as he passes me, I hear him say, ""Niiiiiice.""

Being in the exam room and awaiting my results, I chime in with, ""Oh sweet, I'm negative?"" He responds with, ""Nah, I saw the stonks on your phone. Good luck, retard."" There's a pause in the air before he mentions Reddit and WSB, just to laugh off a potential HR issue calling a patient a retard, Turns out he's here somewhere in the 9 million strong pulling for us and has been holding strong and buying the dips too.

Anyways, TL;DR: My doctor said ""good luck, retard"" while catching me buying dips on AMC and he's here somewhere in the WSB crowd.

143,Using Covered Calls to Buy Volatile Stocks like GEE EM EE at a Steep Discount,2021-02-27 22:49:37,"# Typically, covered calls provide a laughable premium while capping your potential gains.

Let’s use AMD as an example as it looked Friday at close. Going by the book for covered calls, I selected an option with an expiration date just over 28 days away with a delta close to 0.40. This is an 87.50C that expires 26 March 2021. AMD closed at $84.51 when the mid price for this option was $3.07. Purchasing 100 shares of AMD for $8451 and selling this option for $307 costs us $8144 and caps our max gains at $606 or 7.4%. You might as well put your money in a CD or buy a treasury bond, amiright?

Now let’s run the numbers for GME ($101.74) using an option with the same expiration and similar delta. This is a 280C which had a mid price of $20.03 at close. Purchasing 100 shares of GME for $10174 and selling the 280C for $2003 costs us $8171 and caps our max profit at $19829 or 242.7%.

# What’s the downside?

1. $19.8k is not the moon
2. $8171 is a high entry point vs buying FDs
3. Paper handing the shares before the call expires is risky unless you buy/close the call

# What’s the upside?

1. This creates upward buying pressure with less money
2. You paid $8171 for $10174 worth of shares
3. Dividends pay out 15 March

# Additional Considerations

1. GameStop’s earnings report is projected to release on 1 April but could release as early as 25 March
2. A squeeze could happen and the price could dip before your call is exercised
3. I have no idea what I’m doing and I'm not recommending this as a strategy

147,DON'T SELL AT A LOSS. (some advice on fundamentals for new traders),2021-02-26 20:56:41,"💎🙌🦍here. I wrote some basic advice I'll repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action, or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paper-handing. Paper-handing is fundamentally bad investment practice, especially if you're a new investor. I'll explain why.

*DISLAIMER: I've only been trading for a few years and I only know this shit because I have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff, and he hasn’t steered me wrong yet. So take it for what it’s worth... But based on all the fact that paper-handing is even an issue here, you apes clearly need this advice.* ***EDIT: These are ""fundamentals"" to the way I trade, but obviously everyone's trading strategy is different. Note that this is a quantitative approach to investing, which doesn't encourage YOLO-ing. This is ONE WAY to invest which does not require you to ""outsmart"" the general public by spotting opportunities/value before the market does. I feel it's particularly relevant to the GME play. The ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it. There are other approaches (which often require more experience) but I feel this is most accessible to new investors. GME is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything. Well, everything that you don’t think will go bankrupt or get delisted.***

**New traders, or people who are thinking of becoming new traders, should read this.** Especially if you're new, I think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market. This applies to all stock, not just GME. If you're experienced, it might just sound like I'm explaining at length why 2 + 2 = 4, but since a friend of a friend told me he paper-handed on GME (sold the dip), I feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea.

**I would encourage people to buy GME, but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while.** (edit: in addition, just to reiterate, keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down) By this I mean **NEVER SELL AT A LOSS**. Simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down. All newbie investors (IMO) should adhere to this rule just in general. Buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground, or don’t buy it at all.

Many investors, myself included, follow this rule religiously, not just with GME but with all stocks. I have never lost money in the stock market because I never sold at a loss, I just held or bought more. COVID crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out? I just held and was fine... should have bought more. If everyone bought into GME with this mindset, I bet it would go to Pluto easily.

If you sell at a loss, you are donating to the ""save the short sellers"" fund out of your own wallet, fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes, and you’re not even following sound investment practice. Just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy. If you’re thinking of investing so much that you’ll wuss out, poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red... just don’t. Emotion and the stock market do not mix well.

Stop losses (below purchase price) are also for pansies and genuine idiots. “I’ll sell you some stock... but only if you give me a bad enough price on it.” Your plan should be to BUY when the stock goes down... if you feel like you need a stop loss, you're investing more than you should. Instead of being stupid, maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips.

Side note: personally, in the case of GME, I don’t have any limit sells either. From what I can tell on past short squeezes, the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down. So as long as you keep an eye on GME when it actually does skyrocket, you should have plenty of time. Set price alerts and relax. No need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket mid-launch.

Although, if you want you can try to profit off GME volatility. Some people are getting shamed for taking profits but I'm not sure they deserve it. As far as I know, buying low and selling high doesn’t really help HFs, it drives the price up (just not as much as buying and holding). But personally, my philosophy is, I can take baby profits anytime... who knows when something like this GME rise will happen again. So I’m holding (101 shares at cost average $106/share).

Want to get into the game now? You could always just buy a few shares, and keep the rest of what you’re willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip. And buy a little bit more each time it goes down more, bringing your cost average down. Ideally, you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero. Always try to keep cash in reserve.

Locked yourself in at a high price? That's why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down. Didn't keep any cash in reserve? Guess you're stuck waiting for one of three things: 1) the short squeeze which will likely (though not certainly) happen, 2) for the price of GME to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases, or 3) you get your hands on some more cash you're willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down. **DO NOT SELL AT A LOSS** and you will never lose (edit: well, seldom, if ever. Unless the company goes bankrupt, a rare occurrence. This is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket, and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero, it won't swallow your portfolio. Also, if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something, you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson). Hedge funds and billionaires know this, that's why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic. They bought the dip while regular folks paper-handed and got even poorer.

One more little trick. If you manage to scoop up a nice juicy 100 shares, then even if your position goes “underwater,” you can always sell calls at above your average cost, bring DOWN your cost basis, and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss. Although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze. Bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen, and you'll need to be patient and, like I said before, say goodbye to your money for a while.

**EDIT:** Just to reiterate, there are many trading strategies and I just feel this is one of the best for newbies. Trade however you want, just don’t paper hand GME. I would also note that you *can* sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule, if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price. It still follows the rule of ""don't sell at a loss."" Buy one share at $90 and sell it at $100, doesn't matter if you still have 100 shares in the red from earlier. You can even (slowly) take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down 5%, and sell one when it goes up 5%.

**EDIT:** Yes I know about opportunity cost. It does apply if you know something the general public doesn’t (rare if you’re just a low IQ ape but GME was/is an exception). Many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesn't, it could be a coin flip whether you'll hit rock bottom. In an ideal world, you can keep some money in reserve so you don’t have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities. Yes I know about (and agree with) the sunk cost fallacy. My point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal, lowering the cost basis, not “doubling down” on sunk cost.

148,Weekly Market Forecast - 2021-02-27 YOLO Capital,2021-02-28 02:02:31,"Hello Apes,  
This is one of my first posts and am going to try to make this a weekly thing to help you apes and autists out. 

Hedgefunds and asset management firms have these analysts preparing all these market forecasts all the time. I feel like us apes could come together to defeat the hedgies by putting all our thoughts together and getting a sense of how the market might look like in the near future. So we can get tendies! Who wants tendies? I want tendies!

Please note this is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just an ape. This is purely for education purpose. Please consult a financial advisor not me.

You all must be wondering, what the hell is going on in the market lately? Why are stonks down? Where are my tendies?

Well Apes, apparently there are these things called bonds. JPOW sells these things at auctions and people buy them! Can you believe it? People actually buy things other than stonks.

Lately these bond traders have been very worried that things are getting back to normal! There's $1.9 trillion on its way and that means tendies! Tendies for everyone! And that means prices of things might go up. And if that happens then Fed might have to raise interest rates to keep the prices from getting out of control!

These genuis bond traders have ultra paper hands and they were expecting rates to rise in 2023. But they are afriad they might go up in 2022! Oh lawd! Have mercy.

If interest rates go up. It means stonks go down! Witchcraft! These bond traders are scared and pooping their pants. No one is buying, which is driving the prices of some of these bonds down. means yields are rising! Rising yields oh no!  Everyone is panicking and cashing out.

So bond traders are all looking at JPOW like what you gonna do. You gonna keep running that printer or stop? JPOW is like. Whatever YOLO. But bond traders are not convinced. They feel like JPOW like a cheating boyfriend is lying and will probably backstab them and raise rates.

So bond traders don't wknow what to do. They are panicking. Scared and running around like chickens without heads. All this fear is spreading into the stock market and people are selling their stocks.

Stocks are down! Stocks are down! Stocks are down!

So what's ahead? Well Feb's job report is out on FRIDAY. If the numbers look good Thats Bad! Good means bad because it means things are getting back to normal. No! Bond traders don't want things to get back to normal. If numbers are bad Thats good! Because that means less risk of higher rates.

Good is bad and bad is Good!  What in the world is going on?!?

Well - All you need to know is JPOW is speaking on Thursday. Everyone will be watching. If he says something stupid... Stonks will go down. So lets hope he doesn't say anything stupid. Job reports out on Friday. If report is good then more red! 

Also - Expect some more red if bond traders panic a bit more and drag the stocks down. If there is fear in the market then fewer insitutions will buy stuff. Apes are still buying. So keep buying and keep holding those diamond hands. Don't paper hand! Hold Strong! Let the insitution paper hand. If we keep holding. The market will stabilize in the next week or so. If we buy that means more tendies.

All the best Apes. Just remember, expect turbulence ahead. But it will pass in a week or so. As soon as those stimulus cheques hit the streets, there will be tendies! Glorious tendies.

149,🐸🐸 JFrog $FROG DD - A great software company with a lot of room for growth. 🐸🐸,2021-02-28 03:20:57,"# 🐸 is getting ready to leap.

This is my first DD post so I would appreciate any feedback and criticism of assumptions I am making here. But I thing that JFrog is setup for a good run in the next few months and here is why.

# What do they do?

Their main product is JFrog Artifactory which is a universal repository for software binaries (runnable code) and it also serves as a mirror repository - local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer JFrog X-Ray that scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities). This is one of the most critical cogs in the software sausage factory, Artifactory is comparable to a walk in refrigerator, with the mirror repo it adds the loading dock, with X-Ray it also helps to ensure food safety.

**You may have heard of the Solarwinds attack and if you have been following it heard that it is described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack. In my professional opinion, the toolset JFrog offers is the best available to combat this kind of threat and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security.** That is why I am very much a Bullfrog 🐂🐸. If there is interest, I will do a deeper dive into this aspect at another time but for this initial one, this is the huge surge in demand for their capabilities and the need for going beyond the basics is my thesis why this company is positioned to do very, very well going forward.

# Company background

They were founded in 2008 and there main product has been Artifactory ever since. It has only 1 direct competitor with similar scope, Sonatype Nexus, but Artifactory is better and cheaper. Sonatype started as a plugin for Artifactory that does something similar to X-Ray before X-Ray existed, then they copycatted the Universal Repo, so JFrog hit back with X-Ray. I have used both of these products over the years (since 2013) and I have worked in environments without, Artifactory improves developer productivity a lot and it secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by most of the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook. These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe**. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have over 90% renewal rate of their customers.

They acquired Shippable in 2019 which basically lets them offer the whole sausage factory. Though the area where this competes is very competitive with some very good products that are Open Source.

Their focus lately has been on offering a SaaS model to complement their on prem offering and make adoption easier. This should also grow their revenue a lot because it will make it easier to buy the total package instead of just the most basic.

They went public in late 2020 but it was very low key since they came out the same day as Snowflake.

# Financials

I am including a couple of Comps here based on the segment they operate in. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello which are used by most software teams for managing requirements and agile software Team collaboration. I picked them as a comp because I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

* As a high growth software company, unsurprisingly their GAAP earnings are negative. Surprisingly to me though, they are very minor and they have even had 1 quarter of profitability.
   * FROG: -$0.1861
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Their market cap
   * FROG: $4.9 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Their forward P/E Ratio
   * FROG: 615
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* They don’t have any long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* Their margin is over 80%
* Revenue is growing 44% YOY

# Ownership

65% owned by insiders and institutions

Most of that ownership is insiders because there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Index Fund) that own it.

Their final lockup was just released on 2/16 after their earnings and insiders have through 3/13 to sell before they go back into lockup. This is similar to what happened with Palantir recently, but it seems like most of them have sold what they are going to sell.

# TL;DR

They have a great product and have cornered a growing market they invented which has high barriers to entry. They are well managed and have good financials as well.

# Positions

420 shares and 61 options, I am planning to get 8 more options on Monday. If you haven't guessed yet, I like the stock. You can check my post history to see some YOLO posts from earlier this week. I will post another update when I am fully loaded with 420/69 to ride this 🚀

My EOY price target is at least $100/share from the current price which is at $53.49 on Friday.

155,WHY THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE,2021-02-26 23:11:08,"BEAR WITH ME APES, THIS IS GONNE BE A LONG ONE.

**Technical similarities compared to last time**: If you look at the volume activity 1/13 – 1/19, there is a huge volume spike compared to the previous weeks that coincides with a small price bump (it’s actually big but it’s GME we’re talking about so I’m speaking in relative terms). Then, volume decreases and the price levels off. Then on January 21 (Friday), we GME have the biggest volume its ever had in a day. However, this only raised the price to about $70. The next few days volume that was not as high as that day but still higher than any other days before and after and the price got up to about $150. Then on Jan 27 and 28, that’s when we see the price get to its highest points ever, but volume is only about half of what it was the previous days. After that, we all know what happened. Now, compare that price and volume action to now and I think we have something similar. I think that this week’s price action (and potentially next week’s) and volume coincides with the volume and price action of 1/13-1/19 as it has spiked from recent levels and the price has cooled off/stabilized.

Another thing to see is that the MACD on the 1-year chart just had a bullish convergence. For those of you autists who don’t know what that is, it means that the price action has started a bullish trend. The last time it did that on the 1-year chart was in early January when the squeeze was taking form.

It’s also very important to consider the day of the week in this equation. Because of how option expiry works, Fridays are going to be the worst days for this stock as market makers will try to push it down so they aren’t obligated to exercise a larger number of options, so that’s why today was pretty red (although not horribly). Expect this going into the future and keep that in the back of your mind.

**Similar market conditions:** Look at market conditions from last time compared to this time. SPX down massively, VIX up massively then and now. Do you really think that this market correction is only because of bond yields even when JPOW promised no rate hikes for at least a year? Fuck no, it’s because funds are having to liquidate other positions to cover GME shorts.

Conflicting short interest numbers and comparisons to last time: The short interest numbers that are available are very conflicting. Some sites say it’s 41% (which is still huge), others say its 15-20%. The issue with this is that these sites are updated only every 2 weeks or 1 month, so most of this data is reflective of the post-squeeze when short interest was lower. HOWEVER, Fintel updates the available short shares regularly and yesterday it was 0 at one point and today it got up to 600k but has been declining to about 400k now. This leads me to believe that short interest has gone up massively (cuz hedge funds are greedy fucks who don’t learn their lesson) and that once it is updated, we will see that short interest is back up sky-high (yeah I bet that’ll get a few more people interested in this). The overarching thing to take from this is that there is still short interest, possibly massive short interest, and that many funds still have not covered from last time. The borrow fees have gone up 9x since two days ago and the shares available to short have gone down significantly ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)). This is exactly what happened last time, and continued movements in these patterns are exactly what we need.

Just as a little side bar, also look at AMC. It's also repeating the same pattern as GME. Is this because AMC has the same short interest propositions as GME? Probably not, I think that AMC just rises with GME, but this is just another interesting similarity to last time.

**RH:** As I said above, the reason that the stock went down last time was because of brokers restricting buying but not selling, not because the squeeze was over and funds covered or put more downward pressure on it. I would bet that RH and other firms WILL NOT restrict buying this time (unless it goes above 1k) because A) they are much more liquid as of now and B) they do not want another one of these press nightmares. Obviously, if this gets too high they’re gonna have to restrict again, but I think that we are safe on that front until it gets higher than last time. I also just wanna point out that the CEO of Interactive Brokers even said on CNBC that the price of GME would’ve gone up to over $1000 if the brokers didn’t halt buying, so don’t underestimate our power. I just want to emphasize that if this gets sufficiently high again they WILL undoubtedly have to restrict again (whether this is their fault or not), so any talk of this getting above 5 figures is unlikely to be true. However, we could EASILY see it jump to 4 figures if what I'm saying comes to fruition. IF YOU ARE NOT SUPRISED WHEN GME GOES UP ABOVE 500, DO NOT BE SUPRISED WHEN BROKERAGES ASS RAM YOU!!!!!

**Short interest**: Last time we undoubtedly had a short squeeze as short float was over 100%. This time, it seems to be about 40% (BUT these statistics don’t get updated very often so it could be even higher). Therefore, there will probably not be a short squeeze like last time, however, because of options activity there could be a gamma squeeze that could then trigger a short squeeze for these 40%, which would still lead to a massive jump (potentially bigger than last time due to the 800 OTM calls). What I tend to believe is that many funds either didn’t cover last time or reshorted when it was at like $300 and are trying to make it go to 0. If this is the case, that makes me believe that there is significantly higher short interest than the websites are reporting (because they don’t update often, sometimes it takes them 2 weeks to 1 month to update). In this situation, however, the short interest is not as important as the options activity.

**How OTM calls can multiply this**: The reason for the last gamma squeeze was because market makers had to hedge the massive OTM calls that became ITM (meaning they had to buy more shares). However, at the time, the most OTM strike was something like 200-300 (eventually getting up to over 500). Now, because of the last squeeze, we have OTM calls with strikes of 800. This means if the price keeps going up, there is going to be a massive feedback loop of market makers having to continually cover that could lead to an even bigger squeeze than last time. Like I said above, a short squeeze like last time is unlikely because of the short float (unless the numbers are inaccurate), but because of option activity and renewed interest in the stock, we could see an even bigger price hike due to a gamma squeeze that would also force the shorts to cover, which could trigger a small short squeeze.

**Catalysts**: One of the most important things that I’ve learned about GME over the past few months is how WSB reacts to its catalysts. This stock has showed us that it reacts VERY strongly to catalysts, specifically ones dealing with Ryan Cohen and leadership. As we know, the first one was triggered by Cohen becoming a large owner of GME. This current one was triggered by the CFO being ousted and partially by Cohen tweeting about an ice cream cone. As Andrew Left from Shitron said, he thinks that GME should dilute some shares and make an acquisition. This would hurt it very short term but would probably lead to overall massive growth after a small dip because speculation interest on the stock would skyrocket. We also have the possibility of Ryan Cohen making more moves such as hires, appointing himself ceo, acquisitions, more tweets, etc. MOST OF ALL, we have earnings on March 25 (thankfully after hours, which is when this thing likes to jump). I’m gonna take a guess and say that Cohen and the board will make some kind of announcement or statement that will lead to this thing running up massively. I believe THAT is what will push this up to the highest level possible and could trigger the above mentioned short + gamma squeeze. This would happen the next day, March 26. That also perfectly coincides with the end of the month, which is when market makers would have to really start hedging against these super OTM calls, which could trigger a gamma squeeze. Quite honestly, because of WSB interest in this and the continued short interest on this stock, I could see this type of thing happening every single time there’s a catalyst especially at the end of each month.

**The Point**: The point of this is that IT’S NOT FUCKING OVER. This squeeze will likely take longer than the first one, but could EASILY be much larger if people continue to hold in good times and in bad. This article makes great points about why it could take longer than the last squeeze and suggest you read it as it’s very short: [https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/](https://investorscult.com/2021/02/26/gme-short-squeeze/)

The diamond handers who help after the first squeeze are getting rewarded during this one, and anyone who keeps holding will probably be rewarded in the next one. Hedge funds are undoubtedly on this sub right now spreading misinformation, but just know that these fuckers still have a TON of skin in the game and are still massively exposed and vulnerable to an even bigger squeeze. If we know anything, it’s that wall street doesn’t learn after it fucks up (i.e. 2008), and you can bet your ass that these funds still have massive short positions and won’t sell until GME goes to zero or until WSB puts the funds to zero.

STAY STRONG APES. IF THE STOCK GOES PAST 800 MY WIFE’S BOYFRIEND HAS PROMISED TO LET ME SLEEP IN THE GARAGE INSTEAD OF UNDER THE DECK. (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, I’m just a dude with a small penis)

**EDIT**: WOW thank you for all of the replies! I completely forgot to mention all of the shorting through the ETFs (especially XRT). That makes me even more bullish on this. If GME continues to rise, these ETFs will have to buy more GME to balance becuase of the increased value. This is yet another example of how each rise in price could lead to a massive feedback loop further pushing up the price. I also loved the comments about all of the artificial/phantom shorts which make it even more likely that it’s over 100% shorter. HOWEVER, This all makes me wonder why the hedge funds are doing this, why are they trying to push it down so much? If this is out of rage from last time or if they're still trying to make their money back from all of the losses from last time, then they still clearly haven't learned and that again makes me think that this is all FAR from over. Finally, our lord and savior DFV has 500 call options expiring April 16th ($12 strike, so not a shot in hell these are ever OTM). 100% chance our daddy exercises all of these bad boys, and probably buys more options/stock, which will just provide more upward momentum. I truly believe that the HF are shorting this out of spite and are acting illogical out of rage. For those of you who say “HF won’t fuck up again they learned from their mistakes” .... 2007/2008 has entered the chat.

Like I said, I think that this squeeze will take longer than the last one, but could easily be bigger. I can't emphasize enough how important I think the earnings call catalyst will be. Be strong apes, don't get down over days or weeks of red because it is likely that we will take a rash of shit for a little but you must stay strong.

Our favorite market manipulator Andrew Left of Shitron opened a short position on our favorite stock and:
* declared a [$20 PT](https://twitter.com/citronresearch/status/1352297677086605312?s=21)

* called us the suckers at the [poker table](https://twitter.com/citronresearch/status/1351544479547760642?s=21)

**Now in February**

Andrew is now [mad bullish](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2AP25S) saying:

&gt;; “Six weeks ago this brand was (close to) being dead,” he said. Now it's a “hot brand” that can raise money and reestablish itself as a strong player, he said, valuing the company at between $8 billion and $10 billion. GameStop was valued at around $6.4 billion before Thursday's rally.

That’s a PT of **$143**

He goes on to hilariously complain:

&gt; What’s changed? I realize that there are millions of kids in this country who like to gamble,” he said. “If they combined, as a short seller, I wouldn’t even think about touching that.”

TL;DR- Shitron’s Andrew Left goes from $20 PT shorter to $143 PT bull in 1 month. How the turntables"
164,"Y'all need to realize, $800 was not a make or break for GameStop today.",2021-02-26 23:04:34,"After my last DD about how if we hit $800 today we would trigger the MOASS, there seems to be a lot of misinformation floating around illustrating this idea that if GameStop did *not* hit 800 today that it's over.

This is not the case in the slightest, and my only guess is a mix of shills/bots and worried newbies are spreading these comments.

*If it hits 800 any week it will trigger a massive gamma squeeze, but each week sooner it does it the greater the gamma squeeze will be. If it doesn't hit 800 today, it's not a big deal.*

What matters in gamma squeezes is the *number of contracts,* come next week there might be more contracts than this week anyway, there's literally nothing to worry about.

Hitting 800 in 2 days was very unlikely from the beginning, however, *if* it had happened it would have triggered the greatest gamma squeeze of all time, that's what made the 2/26 date so exciting. However, we still closed above $100, so that means that all the contracts from 40-100 this week are now ITM, which means we will most likely see a nice gamma squeeze next week. It's simply business as usual folks.

*If it hits 800* ***at any point***\*, we will still see a massive gamma squeeze as all the contracts will be in the money.\* There is no date restriction on this, 2/26 was just kinda insane because we had the potential to go from 40 to 800 in a span of 2 days, which would have been fucking bonkers.

That is all, just wanted to clarify some things cause I see a lot of worry for some reason."
165,How the hedges hoped this would go...,2021-02-26 21:03:47,"For all the new GME investors who might be slightly confused about why and how the hedge funds have gotten themselves backed into this corner..

Melvin and friends thought that GameStop was a failing company, so they decided to short it's stock. They got so greedy, they decided that they would short the company by more stock than actually existed (naked short selling),  such was their confidence that GameStop was worthless.

The very act of doing this, if it hadn't been discovered might very well have driven Gamestop into bankruptcy, with the company still being viable.

When a company goes bankrupt, the short sellers don't haver to buy back or return the stock, so if GameStop had been driven into bankruptcy, this dirty illegal tactic they used might never have been exposed. By not having to buy the stock back, they make maximum profit on their short trade, and don't even have to pay any taxes on their profits. This is a short sellers wet dream.

Tens of thousands of people lose their jobs, homes get repossessed, suicides increase, families devastated, all while Melvin and his buddies eat caviar, sip champagne on balconies and count their ill gotten gains. It really is the devil's work what they do.

But now that the hedgie's devious ways have been exposed and shared with apes allover the world, Melvin and his friends can never drive GameStop into the ground, so they will be forced to buy back the shares at some stage. And because they were so greedy by naked short selling, now they have to buy back more shares than actually exist. They sold fake counterfeit shares, but they need to buy back real shares, the shares we own.

So even if you only hold 1 share, they need it. They need to buy every single share that actually exists to cover their position. And that is why 1 share of GameStop is worth whatever price you're willing to sell for, even if it's $500k and above.

For the last few weeks, Melvin and friends have been using even dirtier tactics, trying to fool us all into thinking that they do not need our shares.

Do not fall for this. They will use every psychological tactic they can to convince you to sell. Manipulating the price, turning off the buy button via RobinHood, paying media to say they have already covered etc. They are going to be using even dirtier tactics over the coming weeks,  some that we haven't event thought of yet.

All we need to do is hold ; nothing else, and get on with life.

168,Right Time for Rite Aid ( RAD ) ?,2021-02-27 20:10:09,"This analysis looks at one possible break-up scenario of the Rite Aid corporation that projects a return of more than 2.5X the closing share price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021.

Rite Aid (RAD) consists of two (2) parts:

1. The Retail Pharmacy business currently generating approximately $16 billion in annual revenues.
2. The Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) services business known as ELIXIR, currently generating approximately $8 billion in annual revenues.

One possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand.  What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization.  Here is an estimation of how such an approach might play out:

* In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash.  That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store.
* Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand.  Despite the fact that many of these stores are located in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store.
* At a average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand).
* The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of +$1.2 billion, assuming that $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books.
* ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion.  During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of  23 - 29%.
* ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (begining March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million.  Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year.
* With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings.  Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results.   However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is more than 2.5X the closing price of $19.58 on Friday, February 26, 2021).
* The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry.  With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.

In conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just under $20.

The purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward.  (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully in tact.)  Rather, the purpose of the post was to reveal the hidden value locked within RAD that is clearly being overlooked by the investment community, by analyzing one possible break-up scenario."

Since then the volume of shortable shares has increased to 600,000 BUT the fee to short these shares has increased from 0.8% on 2/24 to a whopping 12.78% as of 10:00am today representing a nearly 1,500% increase.

186,Is shorting bonds the new infinite money glitch?,2021-02-27 12:16:05,"Good morning my fellow degenerates, hope you all are in good health and spirit. 

***TLDR: Shorting bonds could be one hell of a play. Shorting emerging market foreign junk grade - corporate bonds might be the fucking moonshot if I'm right.*** 

Today I want to talk about the most boomer investment there is: Fixed Income securities: or bonds. 

So just some background information: Bonds are a debt based security. Meaning that you are loaning a company, municipality or government money in exchange for regular interest payments. But the underlying issue I see is when any significant inflation happens(it's **when** not if, more on this later), and the fed hikes rates, most of the bonds issued now and in the past few years suffer from something called interest rate risk. 

Interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds. So when rates rise --&gt; existing bonds fall. This makes sense because why would you ever keep money in a bond paying x% when the current going rate for bonds is much higher. This kind of market pressure can quickly tank bond prices. Which is why I think shorting certain corporate bonds or ETFs who hold corporate bonds is a good idea. 

**Why Inflation is going to spike:**

This topic has been discussed to death here on WSB by the few 🌈🐻who haven't yet been hunted to extinction by JPOW's money printer. Now I'm not going to waste your time and explain in detail every reason I believe (relatively high) inflation is just on the horizon. That being said I'm going to recap the highlights of the core arguments:

M1(Money supply) has increased drastically through quantitative easing, but unlike '08 where they lowered rates through decreasing yields on treasuries, they've also started buying up other debt securities **directly** decreasing yields across the board. They did this to help ease the burden on businesses, and allow them to borrow money for much cheaper. They also did this because the credit market froze and when the debt market freezes you know shit is about to go down. But this time, also unlike '08 the fed went full BRRRRRR and well...

&amp;#x200B;

[Does injecting this much money into the system seem sustainable to you?](https://preview.redd.it/fqcibc65ezj61.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d0c2609a617f0bab6205f30d1b90c293dac884e)

&amp;#x200B;

The graph really speaks for itself. So much money has been injected into the economy through the debt markets that bonds yields are practically nothing. The reason we haven't seen that money actually inflate the economy is because the **velocity** **of money** has tanked. 

For the retards in the back who fell asleep in econ 101: the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands to purchase a good or service within a given timeframe. Because economies all across the world are dampened at the moment with all the restrictions and shutdowns the average consumer is spending much less now than they would otherwise be expected to. 

[The velocity of money is going to skyrocket as the economies of the world open back up.](https://preview.redd.it/lvzafh5zfzj61.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=735b0e7796514ed098450521303cb7bfcabf0867)

As all this money, which was previously locked up in households and businesses reenters the economy we'll likely see a sharp uptick in inflation. Now the people who run the federal reserve aren't dumb, they realize that this sharp rise in inflation is bad. The Fed doesn't want to see runaway inflation, and so they'll do whatever they can to counteract the effects of printing this much money. 

The most effective way of the fed counteracting all this printing is by creating a big negative liquidity shock. This is known as quantitative tightening. (Read raising interest rates). Which is going to absolutely decimate bond prices. 

Which is why credit where credit is due: As a liquidity shock occurs the market usually does sell off so the 🌈🐻 converting to a cash position isn't actually the worst thing you could do. But then again being cash gang means inflation gang is slowly eating your effective capital. It also means you hold a position even more fucking boomer (read: boring as shit) than investing in bonds. Congrats!?

Now that we established what interest rate risk is, how it effects bonds and why we're likely to see a substantial amount of it in the coming months / years, it's time to narrow down the pool of bonds we could short. 

Governments across the world are printing money like there's no tomorrow, and this is because the 'growth corrected interest rate' is negative. It's not only negative in Europe and Japan but also much of the developing world. Which means governments there are much likelier to take on higher amounts of debt. Now mathematically speaking this is fine, as long as compound growth outpaces or stays in line with compound interest, this debt is manageable. It becomes less and less of a burden with each subsequent year (inflation). The problem occurs when that growth is strained or when interest rates get hiked. 

[Most rates are effectively negative accounting for growth](https://preview.redd.it/7c49p6gckzj61.png?width=318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11be27b9e3264f759ebade62098727b026bb1e75)

I think the prime target is emerging market foreign junk grade - corporate bonds, that are denominated in USD. The reason I say this, is in the event of QT by the fed, there will be a liquidity shock, creating a spike in demand for (US) dollars, which is what the world relies on for most global trade. This makes the dollar gain value in relation to other currencies quite quickly and probably unexpectedly. (Unless the market prices this in, which will see these bonds decrease in value anyway \[making your short position profitable\])

Bonds from companies that primarily do business in local currencies, but hold debt denominated in dollars face: Exchange rate risk: If the price of their local currency falls in relation to the US dollar they end up paying much more than expected (in their local currency) to keep up with their payments. If this is not an investment grade bond it means rating agencies think the company has heightened default risk. So this very well could be the straw that breaks the camel's back and bankrupts some of these companies even if they stay solvent I think the increased risk would cause a decent sell off.

**Now because I'm not blind and I see the sentiment on this sub and their views on short selling:** 

Unlike Melvin and co I am not over shorting or illegally (naked) short selling a company and directly engineering the failure of these assets / companies. I am merely using the data available to me and making a bet on where bond prices will be in a few years time. If I enter this trade and / or make money off it I will donate a portion of the winnings to a charity that operates within the emerging markets I shorted. 

**Why the fuck are you telling me this now if this isn't going to happen for a while?**

Because the sooner individual investors recognize the opportunity, the sooner individual investors can pick the best targets. Furthermore all of this is for naught if rate hikes are priced in before individual investors enter their short position.

**tHiS iS aLrEaDy PrIcEd iN**

No the fuck it isn't. Why do you think there's usually a market selloff and downward pressure on debt markets directly following rate hike announcements? Unless the news is ridiculously old most of the time it isn't priced in. I watched you retards claim Disney + was priced in for weeks and I still saw Disney's stock spike on rollout day. 

**DISCLAIMERS:**

Disclaimer: I am not as familiar with debt markets as I am with derivative and equity markets so I may have missed something obvious. There's a reason I post this shit before I actually call my broker to initiate the short position. **I am also not a certified financial advisor**, investment in any security poses risk. Not all positions are suitable for all investors. Keep your goals, needs and risk appetite in mind before you invest. 

Disclaimer 2: Shorting debt instruments like bonds carries hidden interest payment risk: You're liable for paying the interest payments until you close out of your short position. Bonds are also much less liquid than stocks, so finding bonds to close out your position could be difficult. Shorting is also an unlimited risk strategy. So idk maybe buy calls on the bonds to hedge. 

Let me know what you think! Am I the next Dr. Michael McFlurry Burry or the most retarded thing this sub has seen since Robinhood box spreads? I don't want to go full retard so I figured I'd let you glorious autists critique my position. Tell me if / how I'm wrong etc."
187,"$GME, $BB, $NOK, $AMC Option Expiry Today - VERY CLOSE TO BEING HUGE",2021-02-26 18:17:53,"People don't seem to fully appreciate HOW many options are VERY CLOSE to being in the money expiring today. As these options become more likely to end up in the money it will create a lot of positive feedback momentum. Not all options buyers will exercise them but many will. Remember each 1 option = 100 shares.

Sort by VOLUME

$GME

EDIT 1 @ 4:30PM:  
**AMC closed at $8.01 AH $8.04**  
**NOK closed at $3.92 AH $3.94**  
**GME closed at $101.74 AH $100.55**  
**BB  closed $10.05 AH $10.03**

Option holders have until 5:30PM to exercise any ITM options. Option sellers will be assigned many obligations to return shares at that price to option holders. You get two days if you don't have the shares already.

This does mean there will be some additional demand for the buying of shares Monday/Tuesday but it is not massive and I don't think it's enough to materially affect price (but what do I know).

It is very common for large banks, like JP Morgan, to sell a lot of options and their goal is for them to expire worthless. They will dump shares to achieve this, and then go long a stock again after they've expired. It's very common around earnings.

There is still A LOT of options on March 5th for GME @ $800 (29,427) @ 200 9,758.

AMC has A LOT MORE: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/options?date=1614902400&amp;p=amc)Almost 100,000 options between $8,$9,$10,$12... So, there's a lot of potential there for momentum. Think of option interest like potential gas on the fire. It can influence price upwards, and increase volatility.

BB gang, so you're not left out, have a decent amount too. A lot of people want to see this stock north of $12.

NOK gang, there are 20,000 contracts at $4 and $4.50 for March 5th... That's a decent amount... So there's potential for momentum here too.

Catalysts for next week? Stimulus vote (which I had hoped would break today). We may also see more capital flows back to equities as the bond sell off normalizes. Growth and momentum stocks may do better (this week low momentum stocks performed best).

Everyone have a great weekend.

192,The Next Chapter in the WSB Storyline,2021-02-27 19:19:24,"I've been lurking here since 2018.  I've been an active WSB community since mid-2019. I remember when WSB was just another Reddit sub with 300,000 members.  I've watched the community storylines of WSB grow greater in grandeur. I'm tempted to call WSB a household name.

What makes WSB so unique from the hundreds, maybe thousands, of stock message boards out there is that the v loose comradery that unites this community together. WSB now affects real change.

So what's next?

WSB likes GameSt0nk. We do not like Robbinhood. So when Robinhood IPOs we should steer clear right? Wrong. The Robbinhood IPO opens the door for new ownership and therefore new leadership. WSB could own and operate Robinhood. We'll have to wait for the details of the IPO, but simply put we could own it.

This would be achieved by accumulating enough stock and then WSB coming together as a minority (or majority) shareholder group. Next is voting rights, then a board member, and eventually a new CEO. This won't happen quickly though...just like the other stonk we all like, it'll be a lengthy war of attrition. It's still worth it though. If you're doing it right, D14m0nd1ng a stonk forever should be effortless.

TL;DR - buying Robbinhood shares might be the contrarian play that we need right now.

PS - Before anyone spouts off about Robbinhood reading this and now being wise to the idea, settle down. You'd be out of your hair brained, ape mind if you think they hadn't thought about something along these lines pre IPO. Well have to wait for the details but with 10m members, it shouldn't be very difficult to own a major chunk.

Positions:CLDR $25c for 1/23ET $8c for 7/21

EDIT: I don't think they'll sell off a majority in the IPO..but who knows. They need a lot of money, billions. They may be just stoopid enough to sell a majority to the public at IPO. What's the reason behind the confidential IPO? Regardless, at some stage insiders will sell and/or they'll need to raise more money. They could eventually end up selling off a majority stake. On the other hand, by WSB holding a significant amount of available shares, we could force them to dilute their company into nothingness because if they ever sold a majority, WSB could quite literally own it and then we're one step closer to that WSB hedgefund that was always a joke, but now a real possibility. Lastly, the shareholder meetings at Robinhood would serve as a great WSB convention. I know this idea isn't popular, especially not right now. I wanted to put it out there anyway.

Edit 2: It is vlad. You got me guys. Sorry about burning all of you over and over again. Does anyone know if this year is a leap year? I hope my app doesn't go down again or whatever. But in the end, I don't really care. Can I get a ban?"

195,Story and DD on ROOT Inc. ($ROOT) – the unknown sibling of $LMND and why I believe it will jump up relatively soon,2021-02-27 17:33:17,"**First, I am not a financial analyst or am I here to advise on what to do, here to just share my personal insights for discussion/entertainment purposes only. I sat quite some time writing this mini article up so at least do not downvote my effort, thanks. TLDR and TLDR of TLDR at the bottom.**

**Second – what is ROOT Inc. and what do they do?**

Root Insurance Company provides [car insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_insurance) to drivers in 30 U.S. states. Root requires drivers to download their [mobile app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) and perform test driving for several weeks while the app monitors the driving behavior in the background. If the driver passes the driving test, they are offered a [premium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance_premium) which is based in part on the driving score calculated during the test drive. Root advertises that they only insure good drivers to keep premiums lower than other insurance companies.

*Root offers a discount to Tesla owners* who drive using [Autosteer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot#Autosteer) mode, making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a [semi-autonomous vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#Semi-automated_vehicles).

In 2020, Root had its [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO) where shares sold at $27 each, raising $724.4 million which was *the largest IPO in Ohio history*. Now, after half a year they are sitting at all time low of $13.

https://preview.redd.it/vbxtfuld22k61.jpg?width=624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbe4d982030a431ea4bc6745d668f043569fd292

As you can see above, this stonk was loved a lot by banks and their analysts when it was released. They all predicted this stock to bounce between 20 to 30 dollars. It got swept hard due to no momentum, due to no interest in the stock, then – shorted the shit out of it. Now? In the lows, undervalued, bound to recover – worst case is **NEUTRAL.**

**Third, sibling of Lemonade stock?**

Root is a TECH company that uses a model to determines insurance premiums based on a person’s driving skills. Better driver means less likely to crash means less likely for Root to have to payout insurance claims. The great thing is all Root customers install the app on their phone, and it tracks their driving, allowing Root to collect more data and improve its model, increasing margins as they can better detect who is likely to crash their car. This model is unique and gives Root a high MOAT as well as high potential market share.

Lemonade is an insurance company like Root, except they are NOT a TECH company. Their business model is just traditional reinsurance. The only thing ""tech"" about them is the fact the UI on their website looks good. So, this brings me to my next point: valuations.

Lemonade, as a traditional insurance company is being evaluated like a tech company. They have a QUARTER YES, A QUARTER of Root's sales (97Mil vs 402Mil respectively) and a HIGHER MARKETCAP SOMEHOW (6.55B vs 4.58B respectively). Now these evaluations would make sense if Lemonade were a tech company and Root was not. It would make sense if Lemonade had room to grow or something unique about it separating it from other insurance companies. But no, it is literally the same as every other insurance company. While Root the actual company with room to grow and high moat is evaluated like Lemonade should have been. (This text was a quote from a reddit user u/peepeeECKSDEE in one of his posts)

**What is their current situation?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tblgfbtg22k61.jpg?width=392&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6774d0402a0f446092516ec276a7b4512828fd99

As you can see the company if insurance has only 3Billion market cap and a relatively cheap price, their average volume is only 2 million per day and they started the whole ride from 27$, down to 14$, then up to 25$ and down a whooping 50% to 12.9$. First time it was around their first earnings, December 1st. The stock plummeted to shits and went from I believe 17/18 to 14. The exact same situation happened now. It went all across down to 12.9 and ended up the final day in the up 13s. Both of earning days and aftermath got shorted hard with a relatively small fee, but a huge amount of shares. I also preview an image from their statistics of shares, 14% shares floated, 40% held by institutions. Right now they are struggling quite heavily due to covid-19 and having to drop premiums and plans. They reported an OK quarter, but I would say it is more positive because we could witness their guidance and awareness in the transcript which I will briefly mention below.

**Options/Puts**

https://preview.redd.it/s2y394jj22k61.jpg?width=624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=590ea30a7054456de00edb7adec69251a775d598

Now I do not play or analyze options of calls/puts nor do I believe I have a decent knowledge of it. But what I can tell is that volumes and open interests are low as the stock has no real spotlight and attention, therefore the price is quite easy to manipulate. I expect puts to be already exercised and closed? Most of them bet the stock will slide down to 12.5 the MOST, while consensus and bearish scenario was at around 15$, now we are literally in the lowest point possible. We still have some open contracts for Late March where people bet it will be at 15, 17, 20 range and it is possible since some people will expect to raise the price as they will want to unload before April when shares unlock. Next week they will also participate in 3 or 4 seminars and conference calls with some other insurance companies and banks. I do not expect a rapid price change, but a bit green color is to be seen.

**Volume**

Because of the immense shorting that happened on Friday, I believe we witnessed something similar which is called the bearish falling three flag. Basically it followed a bearish trend the whole day and dipped twice hard, a lot of people have sold their shares and crippled the price down. Now, I am no expert, but I did some research on falling three patterns and there were quite a few examples where, if the stock was shorted, oversold, etc. it rebounded days and/or weeks after. I share the images below. What happened on Friday is a huge selloff and shorting. Typically this stock trades at 1.5/2.5 mil. Per day, on Friday we saw over 8 million of shares being sold/bought.

https://preview.redd.it/di3kokvk22k61.jpg?width=542&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8f8a1c106eb264b30274ffaf2b13616b3c6c61e

As you can see from IBKR data  below, this shit got shorted by 550k shares in 1 sweep, not a lot of shares are available to short now, but I do expect the number to be bigger next week as there were some panic sellers, but I was watching diligently the battle in 13 lows range. It was changing weirdly, jumps of 10/20 cents once per minute, no 1 cent marching.

[  Strong resistance line at $13, bounced previously](https://preview.redd.it/mud4nl5n22k61.jpg?width=294&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a4d26955e957df916b8334c81650e22723321eb)

Below I am posting their previous earnings report date at December 1st and how it tanked to the bottom, notice the volumes rose heavily and it took 2 weeks for it to rebound and the resistance at 14$ was pretty good.

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/1huyyr7o22k61.jpg?width=422&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=204cd7711bb6e64b30fe48dafd6d7f9496bc36df)

**Lock up season for hunting up in April, after that good to buy**

But, what if it is still not worth it to buy? Well, we should touch a little bit on the bearish and bad scenarios. First of all, as mentioned in earnings transcript and widely known, ROOT sucks at marketing, even Lemonade is better than that and they don’t even need that much marketing cause of the exposure they got during their IPO. They cut expenses, they lowered their advertisements and only expect to increase it going forward if the funds are available. They also have 30 states in their contracts, but have not yet acquired New York and I believe (not sure about this one) California, some other states as well. The competition in insurance business is quite strong, difficult to get ahead and without marketing and key states it is a rocky road.

**Q4 report and team guidance**

So basically, what will you get from reading the transcript? Well, quite literally they are in the weeds (little weeds, maybe moderate). They are battling losses and licking up their wounds, planning out future funds and revenues, marketing (they chose to lower expenses for marketing to cover losses, but expect to double-triple expenses in the future). But what I DID like very much is their team and analysis. These guys literally have it planned out by the numbers on what they expect losses to be, expenses to be, gains to be, literal metrics and good guidance – they are on course for long term and are here to stay, worst case scenario? This will bounce back after covid-19, overall entire industry of insurance is. Some of transcripts you read are (mostly) reports on earnings, revenue and poor guidance or no guidance whatsoever. Look at $SPCE transcript – no revenue no guidance and look at the price + market cap. Guidance is key, and, in most scenarios, I believe it to be more relevant than the revenue part. To me, it said that basically look, we are aware that covid-19 drilled our asses, but we have a plan, nothings changed, we met our metrics and stayed on course. This was reassuring to hear and because they are still growing and made huge progress comparing their playbooks now and years ago, I believe a rebound is soon to happen.

EDIT: FORGOT TO MENTION, in the earnings call they say **they have FUCKING $1.1 BILLION in cash** and cash equivalents at Root, Inc. and outside of regulated insurance entities with an additional $255 million in cash and investments at insurance subsidiaries. This is not a meme stock; this is CRIMINALLY undervalued and under-compared to $LMND. They are in better balance sheets and financial equipment, **better GUIDANCE.**

**TLDR:** Root Inc. is a relatively unknown insurance company that uses an app to provide their services. They got left behind the hype of Lemonade and never got to the same scale to-be-known-wise. This stock has been shorted heavily and the price has been driven down by 50%. Last time this happened it bounced back to near-original price immediately in a week. They got near the starting highest price of all time more weeks later. I see patterns look the same first time it got shorted and brought to 13/14 dollars line. I believe same thing will happen now – we have strong resistance in 13/14 dollars levels and there are safe calls to be made it will go up to 15, 17, 20 dollars. I would buy shares + calls for mid/late March expiry (recovery) and puts for April (share lockup ends). Share price now good for both short term AND long term (which I like a lot).

**TLDR of TLDR**: All time low + strong resistance line, does not look like a falling knife + short percentage + big volume (more than 400%) on Friday – bound to recover from 13/14 dollars AT LEAST up to $15, probably, and most expectedly to $17, questionably but quite likely to $18/20.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

Do your own diligence, do not message me on what to do or not to do, hate or love me, I am just sharing it here since I got banned on other subreddit for mentioning a digital currency couple of times in a row, lol.

**To end, I believe this company is undervalued, shorted, earning transcript showed me they are bound to comeback, good for short term small gains and long-term big gains.**

197,$DOCU is the market leader providing electronic signature technology and automation of the agreement process through its cloud platform.,2021-02-27 18:31:03,"
DocuSign Inc is a large-cap company in the Information Technology sector and the Software industry. Its closest peers in its industry are Atlassian Corporation PLC, RingCentral Inc, and Splunk Inc. DocuSign's solution addresses the core of every business transaction - the agreement - and makes the process much more efficient, resulting in lower processing cost and time.




DocuSign is a leader in electronic signatures and contract life cycle management software. The company has a long runway for growth through viral adoption in greenfield opportunities. I see existing customers adopting more use cases and expanding seats over time, and also moving to the Agreement Cloud platform. DocuSign’s vision is to modernize the contracting process by taking it from a disjointed and paper-based manual sequence of steps to an automated digital and collaborative system. I think the company has mastered the “sign” step of the process and has used it to build the Agreement Cloud around, but there’s more to DocuSign than just e-signatures. The Agreement Cloud is a platform that includes tools to help users prepare contracts using intuitive drag and drop forms, negotiate, e-sign using a variety of enhanced security and identification means, automate agreement workflows for satisfying contract elements post-execution, allow for payment collections, and centralize account management. As use cases expand, I still expect the current primary driver of growth, the e-signature solution, to continue to grow rapidly thanks to the company’s entrenched leadership position and the more unpenetrated market. Underlying the larger picture is that the company still offers free trials and self-service for pain-free test drives. There's strong adoption in the more than 800,000 paid customers, with 12% involving a sales rep, and hundreds of customers already driving annual contract value in excess of $300,000 annually. In the meantime, net dollar retention rates have been strong, about 120%, which we view as very good and is in line with other self-service, viral adoption models in our coverage.




TLDR; DocuSign is the market leader in e-signatures and is expanding to a broader contract life cycle management solution.The free trial, easier implementation, and rapid return on investment for DocuSign customers make for a compelling sales pitch. The company is also enjoying success moving upstream to larger customers.

198,Really long DD and Analysis! What happened yesterday explained in detail and exposing the HFs obvious manipulation.,2021-02-26 11:12:30,"Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!

&amp;#x200B;

First of all: I made a prediction in my post yesterday . The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**

&amp;#x200B;

**9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.

https://preview.redd.it/w8qgdhc52tj61.png?width=1174&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=312ade6cbbff842f8f1c2b85707b9ee414bc5af4

**9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that

https://preview.redd.it/y22hod9b2tj61.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfc15d4f0d31ef8a0f2f1ebfaa90c412711b4b22

**1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time is, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)

https://preview.redd.it/osl59mnb2tj61.png?width=525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfb0f9aa432f6ca45348aa39708ba4786f6f6572

**2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.

https://preview.redd.it/ha1vws1c2tj61.png?width=1049&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd0bd0a7e87335c977ce9581b3a19ef335e37c31

**3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.

https://preview.redd.it/7hp3ktgc2tj61.png?width=1177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4c655e876c22f10194d1e86c2e8c0edfe03e787

NOW THE ANALYSIS:

**WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**

So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.

**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**

Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.

https://preview.redd.it/d3vuakyd2tj61.png?width=453&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=494fb1b56197d7d997e2c0abdd2843f7bd538bcb

**WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**

Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.

https://preview.redd.it/3djwn1de2tj61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ce4f2b20c430b672e8d4a5701c39c327f368e7b

**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**

Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.

IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**): According to this site ([http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**

https://preview.redd.it/lmtsuxki0uj61.png?width=830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=785f8991b72d084e264f5174ac446e619988b8bf

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).

Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS (**[**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

**Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.** 

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like an appropriate play to talk about in the bets forum because of the risk involved. If its played short because a bunch of people bought the wrong ticker then great, puts and shorts will print.

From Barrons:

“It appears Harvey suspects some of the GameStop volatility isn’t due to a short squeeze or aggressive trading, but partly a function of small-cap portfolio managers weighing their options. Managers trying to recapture performance before reconstitution could be driving the stock. That means there could be some more wild trading between now and Russell index reconstitution. “

214,Silver stacker movement a ploy to create the ultimate bag holder?,2021-02-27 22:03:41,"The big players are up a lot over the past year on their silver holdings. If they want to cash out their winnings they have the problem that dumping a large volume of silver will crush prices. Big holders of anything always have that problem -- how to get your money out without pushing the price down too much.

I had a random thought the other day. What if the silver stacker movement is just a ploy to create the ultimate bag holder? Look at what is happening in the retail silver market:

1. The buyer pays a large premium (10-20%) while the seller buys at spot, i.e. like a huge bid/ask spread. Buyers of physical silver start out at a loss and are desensitized to even more loss if silver goes down. Since they're already at a loss they don't want to sell, even if the price keeps going down, because that loss then becomes real to them.
2. Physical silver is less liquid. Not only do you have to sell at spot (while buying at a premium), but you have to haul your silver down to a shop or ship it to a bullion dealer. That's a hassle.
3. Buyers of physical silver are encouraged to hold and to keep stacking. Silver stacking is a cult-like movement that's gaining momentum. Those trying to cash out love this.

If all this was true for stocks, the big players who wanted to cash out at what they thought to be a market top would be in heaven.

[This is GME. This is your rocket ship. Its currently fueling up.](https://preview.redd.it/qfw3u6q2qvj61.png?width=3060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3cd4bcec168e8a068a8de56d40633cb1de77c74)

This is a chart for GME, the price has been adjusted to scale logarithmically to make the trend easier to see and enable us to see all the data points at once. For all you apes out there all that means is the higher you go, the faster you go higher. This trend started in August. It will likely continue as long as Ryan Cohen and the folks he brought over do good work. Now lets address those large spikes.

&amp;#x200B;

[January Ape welcoming party, no despair here.](https://preview.redd.it/x7vxju4trvj61.png?width=3057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ed649938b25bcb7e461ba4ec794d56bbe72fa33)

See this, its a classic example of a textbook speculation bubble (dont panic just breathe and read, if you're having trouble go ask your wifes bf to read it out loud for you.)

[See](https://preview.redd.it/syvpt1m4tvj61.png?width=882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e65377fc7cfcbd212a6ff8ca714ca330fedf02e)

So a speculation bubble occurred, but why? What caused it and what does that mean going forward? Especially with the recent activity yesterday and today.

Firstly I am not a financial advisor, and I don't give financial advice.

Secondly to answer is pretty simple this was caused by millions of apes rushing to the stock market to buy GME duh. News goes viral about the squeeze the apes buy, paper hands sell. Ok but that sounds really bad right? Again not necessarily. Bubbles like this happen all the time on all just about anything that can be traded over time scales ranging from a few hours to a few months. One of the things that makes GME such unique opportunity is that there is an incredibly tiny number of available shares relative to its market cap. This important for the squeze but it also means the price is more susceptible to dramatic price fluctuations. In fact it is this property that make a squeeze possible, its the nitrous in your gas that turns it into rocket fuel. Imagine you and all your neighbors are on a life raft in the middle of the ocean and everyday you get 10 gallons of water to share between you that no big deal but what happens when 10 gallons turns to 9 then 8 then 7 and so on. the less water (available shares) the more volatile you and your neighbors get until eventually everything goes MAD MAX and you have all the water to yourself.

so the speculation boils down to....is this the Squeeze? did it squouze? am i too late? So what does that mean for the apes that boarded at 200 250 400. Well nothing the Price is going to jump around a lot and every time it should settle a little bit higher than before, all the while costing the shorts more and more interest, until the squeeze goes off or the market value has reached your cost basis and you're wishing you bought more dip so you could have averaged down and made a profit by now.

Additionally if you assume the price jump was in fact speculative bubble it means the shorts couldn't really have covered without guaranteeing rocket launch. those arrogant entitled assholes would have had to look in the mirror admit they lost and launch the rocket themselves. OR they could lie to you, and double down. Historically they double down because its not their personal money and the hate being wrong almost as much as they hate losing money

Personally I don't think the shorts will ever capitulate on their own. I think that it will end in one of 3 ways.

1 SEC will turn up some smoking gun of some kind in an investigation that cant be swept away, and a scapegoat will be offered to the public

2 their clearing house will call their the short positions in and they'll go belly up

3 the shorts are right and we're either too dumb or too distracted to out last them

Just to be clear these are all short term endings. The long term end is basically Cohen and Friends save GAMESTOP and turn it into a digital platform powerhouse, or they don't. They got a pretty good track record though. I mean Chewy sells pet food and toys and its valued at nearly 6 times what GAMESTOP is, don't get me wrong I love my dogs but I spend way more on video games each year than I do on pet food and supplies, and I don't think I'm the only one.

OK, so that covers Jan but what about today and yesterday. Well yeah short answer is I'm not sure, but my best guess is that as a result of some options trading practices someone had to buy a bunch of shares to hedge those options and because the available supply is being restricted by all you apes the price reacted extra sensitively kicking off even more hype. This would be a good sign as it means that the fuel mixture (volatility) is getting super powered and just waiting for the right ignition (catalyst.)

227,A short squeeze for dummies in 10 points.,2021-02-26 22:27:14,"So for all my fellow apes who recently joined and may be unsure exactly what a short squeeze is...

1. We own shares that Melvin and friends need to buy at some stage from us to cover their short positions.
2. They were naked short selling, which means they got extra greedy, sold shares that didn't even exist,  and wanted to bankrupt Gamestop. if they had succeeded in bankrupting Gamestop, they would never have had to buy back the shares to cover their shorts and their illegal short selling would never have been known.
3. Apes discovered this and told other apes, so before Melvin could bankrupt Gamestop, all the apes started buying GME stock to thwart Melvin's evil plan.
4. Now that Gamestop has been saved, Melvin will have to buy back the shares they shorted. And its a lot.
5. They must buy the shares from us, and we can offer it to them for whatever price we like.
6. Because we will want so much money from then for each share, they're gonna be forced to sell everything they own to pay for it. This includes all the other shares they own.
7. The market knows this might happen, so everyone starts selling shares in other companies, either to be out of the market for the upcoming turmoil, or to buy GME shares.
8. Eventually the entire market can fall massively, except GME.
9. This is the squeeze. The value of the entire market gets squeezed into 1 stock. GME. Imagine the stock market is an orange being squeezed into a glass. GME is the glass.
10. GME holders now have massive profits, and go buy up all the other shares for cheap in the stock market. We are the new 1%, but because we know what life is like on the bottom, we will be generous with our profits. When the squeeze is done, the world will be a better place."

241,Due Diligence Post - Petrobras (PBR),2021-02-27 16:52:46,"This post is the sharing of my due diligence for Petrobras (Ticker ""PBR"" AKA Pabst Blue Ribbon) after their most recent Q4 2020 results from Thursday, February 25, 2021.

Here are the important facts in my opinion:

1. Cash flow from operations during the three months ended 12/31/20 was $7.1 billion USD.  This represents 14% of their market capitalization during one quarter.  In Q1 2021, I expect it will be at least $10 billion, if not more.  That means if they took the cash on hand at 12/31/20 of $13 billion, plus their cash flows from operations during just the fiscal 2021 year, they could buy back more than 100% of their current market cap of common stock.
2. Their stock tends to move in conjunction with oil prices and also the BRL (local currency) compared to the US Dollar.  So when the US Dollar is weaker, the stock goes up.  Over the past 2 months the US Dollar has increased against the BRL by about 12%, pushing the PBR stock price down during that time. I believe with the US Stimulus about to pass, that this trend will reverse back significantly.
3. The recent news on Monday regarding the replacement of the current CEO of PBR with a retired general was due to complaints about Diesel fuel.  The stock dropped approximately 25% due to this news.  When you review the financials, you can see, in Q4 2020 that $3.7 billion of the $13.9 billion of revenues relates to Diesel fuel.  This is about 25% of the revenues of the Company.  However, the discounts that the government is asking PBR to make will not eliminate the revenue, it will potentially cause maybe a 10% reduction.  So this in effect is only a reduction of revenue by 2.5%.   Also, the board of directors has refused to allow this discount so far.  Therefore, I believe the 25% stock price decline is much steeper than the effect to the Company revenues of 2.5%.
4. The Tech industry is declining as interest rates rise.  Investors are in the process of moving into reopening stocks and commodity stocks in 2021.  Therefore, this is a tailwind for PBR; especially considering that Biden wants to shut down oil production in the USA which will further increase the price of oil and will not affect PBR in any way as Brazil doesn't restrict the oil exploration function in Brazil in the same way that Biden wants to in the USA.  So there will be no impairments on PBR's balance sheet like there will be on the USA companies should Biden decide to ban certain oil properties from permitting.
5. Technically, the stock found support on Monday, February 22, 2021 at $7.80 per share and bounced higher.  On Friday, February 26, 2021, the stock did not cross below $7.85, even when the market was moving lower; therefore there is strong support at this level.

My recommendation is first, to review the news and financials on the SEC website regarding PBR.  Then I recommend purchasing shares of the company under ticker PBR.  If you want to increase exposure, I also recommend purchasing long-dated call options at the $8, $9 and $10 levels for either January 2022 or January 2023.

243,The Post Earnings RKT Play - ROCKET TO THE MOON (Tendie Time),2021-02-26 21:49:18,"**TL;DR RKT is going to bull run all the way to the 9th March after its beautiful earnings and it's time to burn some shorts.**

Yesterday pre-earnings I posted some [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsdpuz/rkt_to_the_moon_dd_and_short_squeeze_opportunity/) on why RKT (Rocket Companies) was a buy. I was right, the earnings were a blowout and at time of writing the stock sits up 10% from highs of a 20% gain during the day. To someone that has not followed RKT this may seem like a missed opportunity. WRONG. Welcome to the Amazon of the Finance World (well near enough).

Rocket by all traditional measures should've risen to $25 (previous close of $19.90) minimum today. Their undoing was their own lack of volatility in the past. Practically since the IPO institutions and savvy retail traders alike have sold calls, some covered, some not to either make a decent return on the stock stuck between $19 and $21 or to average down from a bag holding position above. These players had a huge amount to lose today from a massive price increase (a potential gamma squeeze if it did so). Hence they have done everything in their power alongside weak hands to keep the price below $22.

**Next week, things start to change...**

But before that let's just go over the insane earnings they just report:

1. **EPS $1.09** (analyst prediction $0.87) an insane beat and a rise in quarter net income from $754 million to $2.84 billion.
2. A **special dividend of $1.11** per share to Class A common stock holders on March 9th (note this is important autists).
3. **Partnerships with a multitude of companies including JP Morgan**.
4. Stock buyback not taken place yet but still intended.
5. There's more little nuggets but that's enough for ape brain to take in.

**So what happens next week?**

Firstly the dividend at current stock price is just over **5% yield**. An insane amount. This provides a catalyst for the price in two ways. Firstly, who doesn't want any easy 5% return? This is hardly priced in let's be realistic. These earnings give RKT as **PE of 5**. Way below industry average if you consider them a financial stock and around **3 to 4 times too small** if you consider them a Fintech.

More importantly, let's have a look at RKT's **short interest**. It lies somewhere between 35% and 40%. Now let's be clear this isn't going to be a Reddit, retail investor driven **short squeeze**, RKT has a mkt cap of 40ish billion not 400 million BUT if long institutions pile in we could potentially see a lot of upwards pressure. Shorts have to pay the dividend - an instant 5% loss is not a good look and who knows if there'll be more to come in later earnings. With call holders less in the equation, the shorts have lost one of their biggest allies. It's time to make them pay for dogging this stock since the IPO.

Everyone on here knows what happens when shorts have to cover, and 40% of the float having to cover sounds pretty damn good to me. A huge difference between RKT and other meme stocks is that the price could stay above $30 indefinitely (or higher). Shorts don't like to be stuck indefinitely losing, unlike holding other meme stocks which they expect eventually to collapse - not that they will unless you all have weak hands. Expect raving analyst upgrades all next week hopefully around $30+ to drive the price up more.

With all this in mind expect a huge run up to the 9th of March. I have a genuine PT after that earnings of $40 but if the wind blows in our rocket ship's favour the moon is only the beginning. This Rocket is going up Uranus like your wife's boyfriend's is up hers.

Rocket is recruiting diamond hands, I am sure retail investors helped the shorts today by bagging their lame 10% profit BUT autists and apes we can get 100%, 200% or more!

RKT closed at $21.85 today. It is my firm believe RKT is a **brilliant buy** after these earnings under $24 and if the bull run starts all the way to $30. Management want these shorts out and that's good enough for me, the CEO laughed at the shorts on CNBC.

I am willing to put my money where my mouth is as I averaged up from $30 per cent equivalent CfD contracts at $20.30 to $41 per cent equivalent at $20.91.  In other words get us to $46 because this autist wants his first 100k trade. These values are actually GBP but I presumed you only know dollar due to autism.

**I just like the stock. So buy shares, squeeze shorts.**

**RKT TO THE MOON!**

EDIT: VERY IMPORTANT POINT - some people have pointed out the float is actually around 100 million shares as 95% is held by insiders in a holding company which puts the tradeable mkt cap at around 3 billion not far off GME. Just more reason to buy

246,$SPCE to the goddamned moon - ignore the pain and focus on this industry maker,2021-02-27 10:00:23,"The past week has been fucking rough for us SPCE boys, but good things on the horizon. Bottom line the market doesn’t understand the space industry and how common multiple setbacks are. People not familiar with the space industry want things to happen and want them to happen now. I am very intimate with the space community and have many friends in the industry. The test flight delays overshadowed the strong points mentioned on the earnings call.

1. Comparison: In 2015, SpaceX’s valuation was 10.1B. Today they’re valued at 74B. Going off of market cap, which I know doesn’t represent the whole picture, Virgin is comparable at 9.9B. While SpaceX used government contracts to scale their business and Virgin is mostly focused on the commercial aspects, they are both ultimately trying to capture a similar market – pay for play astronauts. Let’s flash back to 2015, when SpaceX had a similar valuation to our dear $SPCE:

• June 28, 2015 – rocket vaporized

• September 1, 2016 – explosion on launch pad

Now imagine SpaceX being a public company at this point, it’s shares would have tanked. But smart investors (VC bubbas) didn’t panic. In November 2017 SpaceX raised a new round at a valuation of 21.3B – twice it’s valuation from 2 years before despite 2 very public failures with defense (their biggest customer!!) payloads on board. Virgin doesn’t have the comfort of having a few setbacks, because instead of 1B bloated defense satellites on board they have human lives. They have to do everything necessary to protect themselves from that – all while worrying about being a public company! No one remembers the multidude of Spacex failures from 2006-2015. They just see a stable service provider worth almost 75B and wish they could have invested in it. But if it was public, people would’ve been just as hesitant as they’re being with $SPCE today.

2) Leadership changes: Virgin has made it clear that their CFO was only staying on board to aid the transition from private to public. They had shit timing tbh by dropping the update on earning’s day, but this was expected. After the first full year as a traded company, the CFO parted ways to allow space for the fulltime executive. Additionally, they’ve added multiple former Disney executives to oversee their commercialization plan. This experience will have a huge positive impact when $SPCE delivers spaceflight to customers. Think of the combination of the Disney experience with your typical thrill-seeking events.

3) Spaceship 3: New space plane unveiled! I don’t know why everyone’s ignoring this. Virgin is expanding their fleet of servicing planes and improving their ability to provide a once in a lifetime experience to customers. This is coming on March 30 with testing this summer.

4) Financials: For those concerned with cash burn rate, chart mill fundamental analysis gives a current ratio of 6.81 and a quick ratio of 6.59 = no problem at all paying short term obligations. Altman Z score of 41.67 indicates no danger of bankruptcy. Yes they’re hurting, but we have nothing to compare it to. SpaceX was and is a private company who didn’t openly provide quarterly/annual financials. Think of this as creating an entire new industry, straight from Peter Thiel’s Zero to One. This is the stock that can make you a fortune. Just think of parallels you can draw. My mind goes to Tesla, who didn’t have a profitable year for their first 18 years as a company, yet still held a market cap of 100B in January 2020 based on excitement alone (2020 ended up being their first profitable year) – now has &gt;6x’ed.

RECAP: I’m loading up on $SPCE. Come Monday I’m loading up on April calls (to take advantage of March SpaceShip 3 release) and June calls (for May test flight). Sure, come at me with the comparisons to SpaceX and Tesla, I DGAF. People cream at the idea of Elon leading a venture, well guess what Richard Branson was and has always been the epitome of a charismatic founder. All the Elon fanboys should be as hot and heavy about Branson as they are about Elon. Let him make you rich. Use your smooth silky brain to make a good choice and fucking buy $SPCE.

You do you, this isn’t financial advice I just love the stock."

Here's the juicy bits though

""Another lesson from GameStop is to avoid disclosing certain holdings so as to not attract attention from opposite-minded investors. One strategy is to use so-called total return swaps, in which investors pay a bank a fee to earn returns on certain securities but don’t actually own those securities, eliminating the need for disclosure.""

""A hedge-fund manager with $2.5 billion in assets under management said he now uses total return swaps 80% of the time, up from 50% before GameStop. He avoids buying put options, which give investors the right to sell stock at a certain time and price and must be disclosed, and times his trades to minimize disclosure at quarter-end.""

Possibly the juiciest one for last

""Melvin and Maplelane Capital LLC, which lost more than 50% and about 45% in January, respectively, said in quarterly regulatory disclosures about their U.S. stock and options positions filed last week that they had omitted information. Confidential filings with the SEC are a tool activists have long used to build positions in companies quietly.""

#Terms of the bet:

* If GME hits $500 by the end of February, I will drink my own piss

* If GME doesn’t hit $500 by then, GME Apes who accept the bet must read a book on investing, personal finance, or philanthropy.

Interestingly, that post had 0 karma (69% downvoted) and 160 comments. Exactly 4 out of the 160 comments agreed with me. 


I still think GME is a terrible investment. Ryan Cohen’s last company CHWY [has yet to turn a profit.](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/chwy/earnings). Maybe you apes are right and he’s a Business Jesus, but I invest based on numbers not on personality cults, and I haven’t seen any impressive numbers yet that would convince me to buy and hold GME. I do see numbers now and then (like IV%) that convince me to trade short-term--so I still hope it hits $500, I just don’t think it will. My long-term price target is between $2 and $36. I’ll adjust that at the next earnings report (and you should adjust your targets then too).


#Results


Calling all apes who made the bet! There aren’t any trading days left in February. GME didn’t hit $500. You gotta read a book.


Thanks to everyone who was a good sport. A jolly ‘lol gg no re’ to everyone who wasn’t. I’ll let you give yourselves deadlines, since you’re in a better position than me to know how fast you can read. Post a photo of the book with your username written on a piece of paper to verify that you at least picked up a copy of a book. 

Comment on this post with the name of the book you’re going to read and your chosen deadline.

#Why I made this bet: Reason #1

I honestly felt bad about selling GME on the way up. You guys were really convinced that you had some kind of social movement going (you didn’t, you just joined a p*mp n dump) and it felt bad to take advantage of your naivete.

I don’t feel bad anymore. I outlined logical reasons in my post explaining how what you are doing will not accomplish the goals you have set out for yourselves. I explained ways to find out what a company is actually worth. In response, I got called a loser, a fat bastard, a dick, a shill, Melvin, an associate of Gabe, bullshit, a retard (and not in the nice way), a motherfucker, a “reatrd” (in the nice way), a bagholder gone sour, a child of Andrew Left, a bot, a troll, and (my personal favorite) “mr billy big balls”. 

After getting called all those things, I feel good about taking your money. Thanks. That’s problem #1 solved.

#Why I made this bet: Reason #2

Apes ruined wsb. (I think it’s getting a bit better now though).

Shoutout to these dickless apes who talked shit but didn’t take the bet.

271,GME II Return of the Squeeze,2021-02-26 15:36:40,
272,"Simply put, GME is actually extremely undervalued long term.",2021-02-26 21:43:50,"Fellow retards, I might be retarded but I'm just thinking about the future of GME. Ryan Cohen and team turned Chewy into a company worth 40 Billion. Currently trading at 103 a share. Chewy does not have a ton of assets its just an online e-commerce pet store. He beat Amazon out to become the primary pet supply online retailer.

GME actually has real assets, stores all across the country. Imagine what he could do with that. GME 3.8B market cap is absolutely undervalued.

Ryan Cohen saw an opportunity with gamestop, to take a dying company and turn it around doing what he ALREADY KNOWS HOW TO DO.

In short, I like the stock. If I can make some money on a squeeze I'm happy - if somehow things don't work out with a squeeze I'm happy to hold. I'm looking at bringing my average down soon and holding unless this thing pops off to the 1000s.

DFV is a very smart man.

279,Grocery Outlet is an attractive value investment with Tinfoil Hat possibilities,2021-02-27 06:41:47,"
  Grocery Outlet is a boomer bet with overtones of possible insane growth.           
               
First, the bedrock boomer shit. Grocery outlet buys strategically so they can offer products for 50% to 70% cheaper than the competition., Essentially, they allow my broke ass to eat organic ribeye every night if i so choose. 

GO has just 375 locations in 6 states. 

Their most recent 10k was released in 2019 and stated they have a longterm potential of 4,800 locations nationwide. GO is just getting started.

Their longterm growth is projected as 14.7% as compared to industries 12.4% in 2019. 

They plan to expand their number of locations by at least 10% a year. This alone gets my dong hard.

As stated in their 10k, their management is not accustomed to operating a publicly owned business. This sounds bad, but is actually a good thing imo. GO is already an amazing business model. Imagine if an Ackman/R. Cohen type character came in and bought a huge chunk or the company installed a few heavy hitters to help scale the business.In fact,last week they added Maria Fernanda Meija(former VP Kellogg's) and Gail Moody-byrd(AI marketing analytics at noodle.ai)  to the board.        
 
The above would be enough to get me to invest if i were a boomer, but as a WSB mutant, I need a possibility of a tendie volcano. Now for storytime.

HOW GROCERY OUTLET OFFERS DEEP DISCOUNTS
If a store overstocks, a truck gets misdirected, packaging changes, production changes, or any such interruption in the ""Chain of freshness"" occurs, GO capitalizes on this while saving the other company from taking losses.      

THE CHAIN OF FRESHNESS

You may have heard that up to a third of all food produced by Americans is thrown away. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/491513/

The Chain of Freshness describes how this happens and how food MOVES. 1. Food is grown  2. Food sent to be processed and/or packaged/branded. 3. It goes to warehouse(this  sometimes involves many layers of regional and local warehouses.) 4. It goes to a store 5.You buy it.

Anywhere during this chain, product can get slowed down. It wont be fresh enough to  be accepted at the next checkpoint in the Chain, so it goes into a dumpster. Although the ""actual freshness"" of the product may be fresher than you would ever see at a store, its not fresh enough to  go to regional, then local distributors before landing at the store not only fresh enough to consume, but fresh enough to be able to sit on the shelf for however long is required by the stores business plan. 

This would be a good time to state that im technically an ""industry insider"" as ive been dumpster diving for years. Ive seen warehouse dumpsters full to the top with product all packaged and nice, fresher than you would ever see at a store. You may have heard in the news recently about portland police guarding dumpsters full of food from citizens. Fred Meyer said the food was spoiled, but it was just unsellable due to liability issues and food quality laws. Perfectly edible food. https://apnews.com/article/portland-storms-oregon-4eebd2cd2f1b9f798667994bc871a647

This is just the tip of the iceberg, as warehouse dumpsters are usually behind fences and guarded with cameras so no one sees that waste, except for me. I fill my backpack with organic chocolate, hipflasks of brandy, and have personally recovered enough frozen marinated ribs to grill up and play Meat Jenga with(which we actually did.)
 This waste is caused by logistics problems which could be alleviated by Grocery Outlet, adding value to everyone involved
                 
Now imagine this company if Food Waste Laws are passed, penalizing companies who waste food. With images of cops chasing people away from a dumpster full of perfectly good food in the news, the discussion is very likely to surface among other progressive talking points. Grocery Outlet is uniquely positioned to profit from this trend. If Companies were all of a sudden compelled to reduce their waste, it would be a huge growth opportunity. Just based on their current guidance GO is a great bet. But in this rapidly changing world, a newly public company like GO with an innovative business model can change its current guidance multiple times.

Tldr; a long standing glitch in the logistics of how we sell and move food around leads to dumpsters full of perfectly good food that makes up about a third of all the food Americans produce. GO has a unique business plan that, with the help of a big-dick activist investor,  hiring of corporate heavy hitters, and the Possibility of Food Waste Laws could turn those dumpsters full of food into dumpsters full of money for everyone involved.

Heres a link to an article that has the numbers I referenced.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-grocery-outlet-144102370.html

Positions: All shares, about 10% of my investment capital. Long hold. I literally love the stock. I identify with grocery outlet on an emotional level. They allow me to buy all the fancy snacks I like and my loyalty to them is the closest ive come to  truly experiencing religion in my life."
280,Legitimate ways GME could / should grow the business,2021-02-27 02:03:12,"1. Warchest: Raise some fucking capital at these prices for fucks sake, the tendies are there take them. 
2. Get into digital game purchases, think Steam / GMG / GOG / Humble Bundle. Purchasing a company like Green Man Gaming, GOG, Humble would help catapult them into space. 
3. Release a special edition WSB Funko Pop with Diamond Hands and sell it for $42.69
4. Be the only online retailer that can properly handle the scalpers and let me get a PS5 / RTX 3080 etc.. honestly putting engineering resources into this is worth it for customer loyalty. 
5. Social Club for Apes: Support local eSports, have local meetups, and embrace the community. Think along the lines of old-school comic book stores / DnD night.  
6. Old game bundles, new game bundles, rare games, special edition hard copies of digital-only games tie it into local store inventory and... (see #7) 
7. Use the stores like mini distribution centers they are everywhere .. close that last-mile gap and give Amazon a run for its money. if Dominos can get me a Pizza in 30min you can have one employee driving around dropping off local orders. 
8. Make the website not suck
9. Make the mobile app not suck
10. Announce DFV as a boardmember"

$101.74 close🚀🤦‍♂️. Let’s hope the shares get delivered now🤑🤑🤑. 



Feel like this info should be known, just  gets swamped in the mega thread.

Current open contracts with strike $5 to $100 is 51,470 contracts, if GME closes above $100 that’s 51,470 contacts In the money. If these were all exercised (highly unlikely next to impossible) that’s 5,147,000 shares that will have to be delivered. 

There are currently 155,743 open call contracts between $5 and $200, if GME closes above $200 and all these calls are exercised (they won’t all be exercised), that’s 15,574,300 shares that would have to be delivered.

If this happens (which it won’t), I think the stock will go brrr.

Not financial advice. 

This info can be found by googling open options chain.

Edit: The public float of shares is 45.05 million [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME), if we finish above $100 that’s over 10% of the current float in shares that could possibly be exercised by the call contracts.

319,On GME and index re-balancing. DD from behind a Wendy's.,2021-02-26 21:49:46,"Alright, I know most of you can't read anything longer than a fortune cookie, so I'm putting this right up here at the top:

TL;DR -   
1. GME market cap goes up  
2. Index funds end up underweight GME  
3. They must fix this before May/June, or losses are locked in  
4. Tendies   


So I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.

FTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.

All of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.

 A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&amp;P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May/June than we have so far this year.

The last 4 days we have seen Short volume as a percent of total volume between 58-62%.

340,What would you do if Robinhood goes public?,2021-02-27 03:47:42,"Saw news flash that Robinhood might be filing a secret IPO around March. [News flair section also have posts about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltduq8/only_time_we_can_support/). 

Was trying to game out what to do should Robinhood goes IPO and reasons for actions.

a. Short: talk about poetic justice. Robinhood screwed retail investors in the GME squeeze and it is time to squeeze back. Besides, there are ample footings for shorting Robinhood. The GME squeeze has exposed Robinhood's shady practices and it is under a lot of watchful eyes. To file such a hasty IPO when it has not cleared its name yet may be a sign that early investors are already nervous about its prospects and they are trying to capitalize and exit early. 

b. Long: regardless of all the shortfalls, Robinhood has broadened stock trading to an unprecedented level in this market. It still has a strong, loyal and ever expanding user base, including many in this subreddit. Revenue shot up more than 500% in 2020; even after the pandemic ebbs the habit of trading with Robinhood won't die out. 

c. Just a normal stock. Not Boomer's favorite value stock, but not tendies or stonk either. Just something out there in the market. Maybe a stock to park some idle money, but won't expect a YOLO gain/loss. 

d. Don't even want to touch it. Like ex-wife or ex-husband, better be gone and stay gone.

Stream the game - bet on the game - all in the same app.

ER is coming Tuesday of next week. They've raised guidance **TWICE** prior to this earnings report.

We just had the SuperBowl - and March Madness is almost here, the subs are going to be up so bigly over the last Q it will blow your wives boyfriend for her.

The growth potential of FUBO is massive, its another changing of the tides moment where Americans are ditching cable TV providers in favor of streaming services. Think **NFLX**, **ROKU**, etc.. they've all replaced their archaic counterparts. **This is just the streaming end of the business.**

Now factor in the sports betting aspect ( **DKNG**, **PENN**, etc ) and the added value of doing all of this from the same fucking app. Sports betting is slowly rolling out across the entire country. 

Its a perfect storm of fundamentals that support the bull case for FUBO. 

&amp;#x200B;

FUBO's current subscriber base is **500k paid subs**, but check this out:

&gt;""About 70% of Americans classify themselves as sports fans. Around 60% have gambled in the past year. That number is only growing with online sports betting becoming legal in more and more states.""

Thats approx. 220 MILLION sports fans in the us and 190 MILLION who have gambled in the past year.

Lets throw some modesty in here and say FUBO could capture **5%** of this market, aka **\~ 10 MILLION**

**20x their current subscriber base.** 20. Fucking. Times.

Thats if they capture 5% of the market which is pretty fucking reasonable considering there is very limited competition on the sports streaming side of things.

&amp;#x200B;

Alright now let me really fuck you up....

&amp;#x200B;

Lets compare the market cap of some companies in similar positions:

FUBO MARKET CAP: **$3.5 billion**

* NFLX - **$240 billion**
* ROKU - **$50 billion**
* DKNG - **$25 billion**
* PENN - **$18 billion**

I say this with my fist on chest - no fear - ber is fuk..

**FUBO TO $200 THIS YEAR**

&amp;#x200B;

There is also the potential for a short squeeze. I know u retards love short squeezes.

* **53mm float**
* **28 % short**
* **Assuming an average \~ $40 entry for shorts**

&amp;#x200B;

Fubo squeezed during the geemmmeee saga and is now associated with the meme stocks, FUBO is not a fuckin meme, its a motherfucker of a growth stock that has now turned into a powder keg. The ""squeeze"" would be backed by fundamentals, and sustained. 

&amp;#x200B;

The top technical indicators you absolutely must add or know about when it come ms to to your charts:

1-force index, depending on the number it tells you if the uptrend or downtrend in price will continue 

Ex. When extremely rocketing its at +12million
Ex. When extremely drilliling its at -12million

2-Sma: tells you the strength of the trend. It has 2 lines. If above its downturn line, trend will continue

3-rsi: tells you when its overbought or oversold. Great for knowing when to jump in to buy or when to jump out

4-bollinger bands: when it touches its upper or lower bands, it always predicts the reversal

5- Stochastic full: also predicts price reversal when its bands get touched unless it stays there

6-ray: like force index except it tells you when bulls or bear are in control of the price trend

8- Volumeavg: it tells you when a stock mooned, and when it was panick sold. It also tells you the sold amount as a volume bar and the bought amount as a volume bar. I like to use 2 of them and i place them on the chart. One i like to set at 1 day, and the other i like to set at 45days

Theres many others but I like to use them based on my experience with gains and losses

350,Selling PLTR LEAPs Strategy,2021-02-27 06:39:02," 

The Premiums on calls for PLTR@ 25 expiring 1/20/23, approximately two years from now are currently going for about $12. If you were to sell a covered call, based on the market close price of $23.90, you would have a cost basis of 11.90, and a premium of 12. But what if instead of just selling one CC, you sold 512, and then reinvested the majority of the premium back into more covered calls, and then repeated the process until you couldn't buy a full lot of shares anymore. I did the math on this, link down below, It would require approximately $ 1,223,680.00, to do so. Over the course of it you would come into possession of 102,300 shares, collect $1,227,600 in premium, spent about $400 in commissions, if it's at 0.40 a contract.

Your max gain would be $1,339,720.80, assuming it ends above $25, a return of %109 percent in just under 2 years, with a break-even price at approximately $11.09.

Now obviously selling so many options is going to affect the price, so you'll probably get a good bit less in premium then you would have, but what do you think guys, could this actually work?.

351,Why equities are just in the beginning of the bull run [Long post],2021-02-26 17:16:46,"TL;DR: This post will try to present the thesis that equities are just in the beginning of the bull run and argues that you should be investing in the stock market right now.

# Premise:

Equities are selling off due to rising [treasury yield.](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) The reason behind the rise of treasury yields are complex.

But let me try to explain nonetheless.

1. People are expecting that the economy will reopen successfully and will have a higher inflation and all that stuff. Now yields being that low, it was slowly getting unattractive as bonds are not necessarily the best investment if the economy goes into full gear as there is less need for safety and [more appetite  for risk assets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-markets-idUSKBN29Q2NR). Plus, bonds were already at a price where yields  couldn’t have gone any lower(meaning existing bond prices couldn’t have gone any higher). Thus, this lower demand  lead to a rise in yields.
2. This created a feedback loop due to mortgage-backed bond investors selling off their treasury bonds which helped the treasury yield to go even higher. They do it due to convexity hedging. If you have no idea about what I said, [read this one up.](https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/convexity-hedging-haunts-markets-already-reeling-from-bond-rout) This has been one of the primary driver behind the recent movement of treasury yield. Overall, this elevated level in treasury yield is unlikely to sustain because the FED continues to abolish the free market and will continue to buy. Thus, the yield is unlikely to rise too much higher.
3. JPow and Yellen has already given us enough indications that they will accept lower rates for a longer period of time. Specifically, until we reach full employment. Thus, they will allow the economy to get hot and also allow inflation to rise if the mean inflation is 2%. These are based on their publicly stated statements, which means it may mean something.
4. Now, consider the scenario, real interest rate will remain negative, the yield in treasury is unlikely to reach too high because of the artificial market scenario. While, we know that ***long term bonds outperformed stocks tremendously*** over the [last 20 years(article data till April 29)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/business/bonds-beat-stocks-over-20-years.html) With long treasury bonds having an annualised return of 8%+, while S&amp;P 500 having only 5.5%+; that was a terrible risk adjusted return for stocks. The same picture emerges for the last 5 years [since 2015(dataset ourdated).](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/long-dated-treasuries-crush-s-p-500-performance-over-five-years)
   1. This whole ordeal is because yield was very high at the beginning of the century. And as yield continued to fall, the bonds rose in price, as is customary. Now, as the yield slightly rises, it quickly becomes more attractive as the yields could fall pretty quickly and increase the bond price. This also attracts more bond investors; as a result, I suspect that yields will not rise too much. Plus, it is a very crowded trade.
   2. As a result of bond having this superb risk-adjusted return, stocks saw huge outflows. According to Cathie Wood, [stocks saw $300B in outflows(excluding repurchases)  since 2018 and bonds saw $1T in inflows.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-arent-in-a-bubble-but-heres-what-is-according-to-fund-manager-ark-invests-cathie-wood-11612958113) So, if there is actually any bubble, it is in the bond market. Think about it for a second. Sure, bonds provided absolutely superior risk-adjusted return compared to stocks, but because of this, everyone and their mother are in bonds. Stocks were like the orphan child in the bigger scheme of various financial markets.
      1. Now, bond yields are rising slightly and the yield curve is normalising, but going any higher is unlikely due to the slow abolishment of free market. In this scenario, we won't be seeing any negative rates, while continuing to experience negative real interest rate; being a bond investor would be painful. If you are a bond investor already, you want the yield to go lower, potentially negative, but that is not happening either. If yields rise, you are losing money. If you are a prospective bond investor, you have to worry if yields will go higher just after you invest with all the inflation shenanigans going on.
5. Liquidity is present in the market. Bonds aren't that attractive, stocks are a good bet in this scenario. Especially with all those stimulus talks and stuff. Inflation is also good for the stock market overall as long as we don't go Weimar republic style. After all, you are duddenly not going to stop buying from AMZN, stop using MSFT products or PLTR products just because inflation is here. Question is, which stocks? I think boomer stocks are your best friend(look for the things BRK buys). And after the whole convexity hedging and yield rising stabilises, buying the dip in the tech stocks wouldn't be a bad idea either(I think).
6. US Dollar has been declining after March. It is, overall, good for the stock market and the global economy in general. For one, it makes it easier for foreigners to buy US stocks and two, it boosts the earnings of our corporations in foreign markets. One could say, EM stocks are a potential good source for risk-adjusted return and I also think the same. Although, short USD have had been a popular, crowded and winning strategy for the last year, one should be careful in doing so as any black swan event could catapult the USD higher. However, in the long run, I suppose EM stocks would also be a good area to look out for. Especially, India seems to be the choice for our lawmakers currently.
7. Rising commodity prices and stuff are mostly due to speculation, and not specifically supply crunch. Some are saying that we will see very high inflation due to supply shortage, which would be bad for the market. But I disagree. We have so many structural deflationary forces within our economy. Stagnating wages, high unemployment, technological innovations, cheap labour based production in foreign countries, demographic challenges etc. Some supply crunch is definitely there, but to say that production won't normalise after demand rises due to reopening and stuff is being wilfully blind.
   1. Some of you may not know that CPI does include rents, healthcare expenditures and stuff based on how much they actually cost us, so, before you comment that the government is manipulating CPI to make inflation numbers low, I would suggest you to read how [and what are the weights of each consumption factors.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/home.htm) Also, stimulus money hardly increases velocity of money because it doesn't really counter the loss of employment income.
8. Our government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing, from that we can expect they will do everything to stop deflation and inflate away the debts. It is in the best interest of our government to keep borrowing money at low cost and to inflate away the debt. Thus, our government has a huge incentive to keep the yield low, while also allowing inflation to rise. You may think, how can this be a free market if... basically, this is capitalism with USA characteristics. Add to that, direct or indirect beneficiaries of these shit ton of deficit financing is, well, the various companies.

# Conclusion

Using my crystal ball, which cost me $0 to buy, I can say this:

This is what I can say from all the points that I have mentioned. Risk assets like stocks are now more attractive than bonds. USD is accommodative for the stock market. Global economic recovery, especially in EM economies will be good, thus helping our companies. Deficit financing. Inflation will be good for ***most*** stocks. Liquidity is present. Bond yields will also stabilise soon as the feedback loop ultimately stops. No deflation. There is likely going to be real inflow into stocks. Stocks will probably finally outperform long term bonds.

Thus, I think, while we will have lower overall rate of return in this decade, I think we will continue to have a good bull market for a while. Current panic in the market is nonsensical to me.

^(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons and stuff. This is a casino. Don't listen to retards on the internet, please don't. I also have used my crystal ball to predict all those future outcomes.)

Risk of my predictions being completely off the mark.

* Fed decides to increase fed funds rate suddenly for overheating/other events and starts quantitative tightening.
* We do have a huge supply crunch in every sector after reopening and inflation goes to the moon. Yields also goes to the moon.
* Black swan events.
* Think of something yourself man! This was a long ass post and I am getting late for finishing my day's work."

I'm sure some of you guys have read the fantastic DD by [/u/The\_Big\_Short\_2020](https://www.reddit.com/u/The_Big_Short_2020/)

If you haven't already, you should read it.

Linked here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt\_dd\_part\_iii\_but\_rkt\_is\_just\_a\_mortgage\_company/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/)

Now we're here. Rocket Companies absolutely crushed Q4 earnings and has absolutely mega bull guidance. Remember, the PE for Rocket is ridiculously low considering the current market (ITS UNDER 5, whereas other mortgage companies are trading around 15). Zillow, which is pretty much a glorified home selling marketplace, isn't even profitable has a near identical valuation, and even the earnings boost, valued at MORE than 🚀🚀🚀, which is just laughable, considering RKT is a lot more than just a mortgage company (which is detailed in the linked DD).

This is where we talk about the upwards pressure on RKT stock that is coming this next week. With the Q4 earnings release, RKT issued a special dividend of $1.1 per share. This means that shorts have to either cover or pay the dividend by friday, as the dividend is paid out to the owners of the shares at market close 3/9. Since the market operates at T + 2 day settlement, shorts have to cover by this next FRIDAY or pay $40 mil+ to cover the dividend.

To add to the heat, RKT announced 1B in buyback of their only 2B float in december. It appears they have not done it yet, as they have been waiting to release news that they announced last night in their ER. Thus, it is possible they will begin the buyback this week, which kills two birds with one stone, as a buyback will reduce the special dividend they have to pay out and put a ton of upwards pressure on the stock.

This special dividend is not just because the company is doing amazing, it's 100% targeting the 40% short interest in the stock. As a reminder, Dan Gilbert (founder) and Jay Farner (ceo) are highly aware of the short interest in RKT. Jay even talked about it this morning, and Dan alone owns 80% of shares.

TLDR: \~110M SHARES OUTSTANDING, 40% SHORT INTEREST, EVERY SHORT HAS TO PAY $1.1 PER SHARE SHORTED OR COVER BY 🚨FRIDAY🚨 and \~50% OF THE FLOAT BEING BOUGHT BACK THROUGH A BUYBACK.

The pressure from the dividend, insane earnings, and 1B buyback have fueled the rocket. It's up to the market to launch the liftoff, and I don't know about you, but I'm not missing this one.

Positions: $23 C 3/5 x 90

I promised myself that I didn't want to pitch this stock as a short squeeze opportunity, but it has to be said now given where we are at and the catalysts that have all lined up. This is really just a follow up to my previous post last week: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmcjbw/simple_short_and_sweet_smooth_brain_dd_for_why/

Wallstreet and the media thinks we are gamblers. Yes, we are, but we have more solid DD than the big hedgy shorts do. Why do I say this? Well think about what shorts are gambling against here:

1) Special dividend - millionaires could just plop money here for guaranteed returns while the market takes a big fat dump. EASY money for everyone. As long as people buy before March 9th, they are guaranteed $1.11 per share.

2) Share buyback can now be initiated since the partnership news has been released. Oh right that's 1 billion dollars worth.

3) I'm not advocating for it, but they are running the risk of WSB and social media jumping on this because of the high short interest and very real incoming catalysts

The current number of shares available to short as I write this on Fintel = 500, IBKR = 300. The fee on IBKR is a whopping 81.4%.

So you're telling me they're shorting a stock that made 9 billion dollars last year in revenue, has been around for 30 years and survived every single economic downtown and managed to spend 1 billion dollars last year in marketing alone? AND they're shorting a company that just announced a special dividend?!? 

This is a sick joke.

**Volume = 32,404 of expiring calls that had a strike price from $50 to $101 -** Until the last hour of trading on Wednesday, ALL of these contracts were out of the money. These contracts equate to **32,404,000 shares** that will trade hands, some % of which will have to be bought at market prices. I think it is safe to assume the options with high strikes were mainly not covered calls, so these will turn into shares being bought at asking prices.

Obviously this represents an enormous % of the float, which has a huge amount being held by a bunch of retards (myself included), that aren't even for sale. Much of the surge to $180 yesterday can be explained by the writers of these options getting their shit in before expiration, buying shares to cover and driving up the price.

Not smart enough to know how much this will help the price come Monday, but hoping I can at least get some sleep this weekend.

This is my first post so apologies for the suck. Long GME and am not a cat, I just like the stock.

Good luck to all longs.

TL;DR - 32 million shares will trade hands due to options expiring in the money today, that were out of the money since 2/16 until Wed afternoon

369,GME AMC Due Dili Friday 2/26 9:30AM EST short borrow rates and availability,2021-02-26 14:57:10,"GME AMC Friday 2/26 9:30AM EST short borrow rates and availability

At 9:30AM EST The borrowing cost rate on both GME and AMC has moved UP  vs. my last report (Thursday 2/25).

GAMESTOP CORP. -2.248%/APR

AMC ENTERTAINMENT -3.58%/APR

While these rates are slightly higher than yesterday's rates and lower than a few weeks ago &gt;20% APR  rates, any marked-up rates from 'general  collateral' imply the securities remain hard to borrow - to  some extent.   Note this AM there was no problem borrowing either GME or AMC shares at these rates. Yesterday mid-day, there is absolutely NO GME shares to borrow and AMC required a call to account rep, meaning shares were available earlier in  AM but may be fully committed at that point in the day.

Hope this info is helpful and now go have a profitable day."
370,GME: We don't know how many shares can be shorted,2021-02-26 21:35:33,"/sigh

I keep seeing posts and even dedicated threads doing super in-depth analysis of the number of shares available to short. Nearly all of these cite https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

Listen tardy: That's one broker. That's just InteractiveBrokers. It's one of many data points and does not mean much by itself. They could get more available shares because their clients bought GME stock. They could lose available shares because their clients sold GME stock. They could lose available shares because someone borrowed them to short. They could lose available shares because someone asked that their shares not be lent out.

There are many brokers. There are large ""dark pool"" transactions that do not pass through brokerages. [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme) is a better source, though their numbers are imperfect as well. 

So yes, keep half an eye on short volume and the number of shares available to short. It's an interesting metric. But don't obsess over it, and don't make big assumptions about every fluctuation. To some degree we're stuck with very limited information. We can only guess what the missing pieces might be. We're WSB and we often guess wrong.

If you're going to go full autistic and extrapolate things from limited data (be honest, we all know you are), then please know and share the limits of the data you are using."

377,“The real moon play”: Multi-faceted infinite squeeze cycle,2021-02-26 08:18:11,"Revised:
I think I get it now. It’s not one or the other squeeze. It’s all of them together, driving each other. 

Congress just had them testify about round 1 but they don’t even know round two is gonna bigger. They turned the issue into even more discussed worldwide news. That may not be the “catalyst” but it is aerosolized fuel in an enclosed space ready for a spark. 

The Armageddon, only statistically possible but completely unimaginable, scenario we’re heading towards. We all know the shorts exceed the number of available shares and the original SHORT SQUEEZE thesis. But now we have the GAMMA SQUEEZE taking part. Retail figured out how to counter synthetic shorts by forcing institutions to honor call options. Every call option that has been written and is in the money MUST purchase shares in the open market even though THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SHARES IN EXISTENCE TO DO THAT. And not just the shares in the market. This would mean the entire share count held by hedges and clearing houses being transferred to retail and etf ownership through options being exercised. 

Retail countered the naked shorting in way that not only negates it but exponentially increases the squeeze process. 

It’ll be like using a market order to cover a short squeeze, gobbling up any share no matter the cost(remember the 5k snipe orders last time?), except at a market wide level- the entire float PLUS forced shares bought for ITM contracts. 

How much can something cost when it doesn’t exist but HAS to be bought?
The ultimate lesson in supply and demand. 

It’ll be like taking the strength of pliers and adding a hydraulic press. 

We were all looking at it like round one. Over extended hedgie shorts vs retail holders forcing a cover. But the dynamic has evolved to a MULTI FACETED INFINITE SQUEEZE CYCLE.
This is “the moon” play. This makes that AI suggestion of 130k a share make sense. I’m not saying the AI is right necessarily in terms of price. I am saying it’s gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they can’t deliver, and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step. The machine takes information and EXTRAPOLATES. 

It went to 5k when it was retail using available shares to force shorts to cover. How multiplied can it get when that happens again while institutions are forced to buy 100 share lots for contracts? 
There won’t be enough open shares on the market. They’ll have to sell their own to the option holders just to honor them. They’ll have to buy more from other brokers and clearing houses having the same problem. 

And all of this is compounded even further, because the higher this drives the stock the more option contracts are ITM, more forced buying and giving their own shares , more squeezes, more contracts ITM repeat repeat repeat repeat.

That’s the important part. Not just the squeezes. The “cycle”. Because it’s self perpetuating past a certain point, like a dying star reaching the critical mass it takes to become a black hole. 
I saw someone even mention that once and I didn’t understand but they were right. 

It would literally crash the stock market and effect all foreign markets involved. An upwards crash that sucks all capital from the largest players. 

I see people mentioning “rational thought” or “rational behavior” of the stock. 
But it’s not rational. Holding something beyond its suggest value breaks with the notion of rational value systems. It’s mass irrational behavior to cause extreme hyperbolic stock movement. I feel like hyperbolic is the right word over parabolic?

You know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely? This is exactly that situation being played out on a grand scale.

I think it’s kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold. It increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world. There’s not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy. It’s made up to represent something that can’t exist but is necessary to facilitate the notion of unlimited growth. And now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory. 

The entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters. They learned to cheat the system back at us the first time. 
Shorts are creating shorts of shorts. They don’t exist. They’re making unlimited shares to maintain their position. So buyers are gonna do the same thing, but purposely do it in an arena that can’t be expanded indefinitely. They can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth with each other(and through unknowing retail stock-lending program participants) but there are only so many real shares. They are inarguably finite by definition. 
Could they force a reverse split or  force dilution by issuing new shares against shareholders and the company’s will? I  don’t know. 

All we have to do is hold. Hold on to your sense of wonder as the story plays out. 
Hold to your courage. 

I’m not a financial advisor and don’t know what I’m talking about. I just like this stock and stories about the end of the world. 

I don’t even care about the money that much. I just want to take control of my own life. 
I can’t wait for us to read about this moment in history someday, and each think about what small parts we played and how we remember it.

Tl;dr Ape explanation: I want GME to moon, but I am concerned about people being fed false information. 1. The claim Melvin said they didn't close their short position at the hearing is a lie. Their opening statement specifically had them saying they DID close it. 2.  The strategy of ITM calls boosting the price was tested last time &amp; failed last time. These are covered calls. 3. There isn't enough of a short interest to force the price up by holding. The profit comes when HF close positions, but you won't know that happened until it's over.

As I said, there are scenarios where GME can be squeezed. But what scenario is that? And what scenarios are not that?

&amp;#x200B;

1. First thing first, I want to stop a lie that I have seen spread like wildfire. The blatant lie that Melvin Capital, during the Gamestop hearing, admitted to not closing out their short position on Gamestop. This is not true. Now, I am going to assume whoever came up with this lie, did it as a *valiant* effort to help boost the price of Gamestop, and probably hoped no one would call them out on their BS, because nobody else decided to waste their time, watching a 5+ hour congressional hearing about stocks. Those are about the two most boring things in the world, combined. But, you don't even have to get that far into the hearing to call this lie out for the BS that it is. In Melvin Capital's opening statement, within the first minute of it, they state they closed out of their short positions in GME days before any restrictions were put on it. You can look up videos of the opening statements, yourself. I won't baby you that much. So, in conclusion, don't rely on the scenario that Melvin never closed out their short positions. It's a lie and it needs some water doused on it.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Scenario Two, possibly the most believed strategy on GME Thursday/Friday: ""Keeping the price over **(insert dollar amount here),** by Friday close, makes **(insert number here)** of calls ITM, and when they cover, the price is going to rocket!"" Now, I am not going to say this scenario is impossible, but it is not very likely, and it is what got many people burned the last time. Yes, it is true, keeping the price over a certain price, making a lot of calls ITM, can be good for the stock... **IF** those calls aren't covered calls, which I believe that almost all of them are. The week ending Jan. 22nd, there are probably a lot of naked calls. That hurt the sellers, bad, when GME closed at a very high price. Nobody expected it. That helped it a lot the following week when we saw the big spike. But then, let's run down what happened that following week. Yes, RH restricted buying on Thursday, 28th, which I do believe stopped the biggest of the squeezed, but it would not have played a role in the ineffectiveness of the ""Calls ITM"" strategy that followed. That Thursday, the price plummeted into the $200s. That Friday, you heard a lot of chatter of ***""As long as we can get the stock up to $310, a lot of calls will be ITM and we will be golden, my fellow apes! Get it to $320 and that's bonus points. That will be 90k calls that will be ITM and have to cover. That's 9 MILLION SHARES!""*** And yeah, A lot of that was true. There were 90k calls that would be ITM if we closed above $320. And you know what we did? We closed above $320. We closed around $328, in fact. This was it. Come Monday, that price was going to the moon. *""10k isn't a meme!""* We chanted. We couldn't be wrong. We did the maths. We had the DD. Diamonds don't crack, baby! Well, come Monday, there was no lift off. It was the Space Shuttle Columbia all over again. The stock fell, and it fell hard. Going back into the low $200s, dipping into the $100s even, before closing in the $200s. That's okay though. That's fine. They had until Wednesday to *actually* close on those Calls, you'd hear. So Tuesday came and went. Then Wednesday too. We never saw $300 again. In fact, by Friday, we were barely even seeing $100. So what happened? What went wrong? We had maths **AND** anime on our side. Well, what I believe happened is, those Call contract sellers learned their lesson that first week that ended Jan. 22nd, when they got screwed. They didn't let their calls be naked the following week. They bought up GME stocks when it was low at the beginning of that week, if they didn't already have them. This allowed them to resell those stocks at $320 and under, making them the big winners in all of this. But that meant these weren't NEW stocks that would help us go higher. No, these were stocks bought on the way up. They helped us peak but wouldn't help us go ***over*** the peak. So, when those calls executed, there were suddenly a lot of new holders of GME stock. Holders who saw their stocks were worth $300-$320. These weren't diamond handers, like you or I. These apes wanted their bananas ***NOW.*** So they sold when they got them. Gotta cash in those profits at some point. As WSB loves saying ""*You can't lose if you don't sell""*. Well, you also can't win if you don't sell. So now flash forward a month later, and the same theory is being pushed. ""*Keep the price over $100 and we will rocket to $800 come Monday. No, scratch that, $1000. No, wait, even better. $69,420!""* You hear in the echo chamber, bouncing off the walls like GME does in the first 30 minutes of market open. That's not going to happen. These are covered calls that are ITM. You're not forcing anyone to buy new stocks at the current price. You are just buying stocks for $50-$100 that were already bought at $40-$60 and are keeping the stock price stagnant. And none of this is even mentioning that the amount of ITM calls this time is like a third of what it was last time. So, do not rely on this strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Scenario Three: *""tHeY hAvE tO cOveR. tHeN wE cAn sEt oUR oWn pRicE""*. This is probably the most ignorant reason, and is why I typed it out like that. Yeah, I'm mocking you. Get over it. it is true, they do have to cover eventually. But not with your stocks. GME short interest is somewhere around 45-50% (too lazy to relook up the actual number), and this is after new reports showed 1.3 million more shares were shorted on Wednesday. Now, yes, that is a high amount of short interest. But that isn't high enough for the **""Diamond Hands""** approach. There's still 50ish percent of shares out there, not shorted. And yes, Diamond Handers hold a lot of those, most are going to be held by institutions and those institutions are about the money, not the message. They see a 3x profit? They sell. They sell to whoever is willing to buy. Could be more Diamond Handers, could be hedge funds. But eventually, Apes are going to run out of money to buy and hold with. That's when the Hedge Funds can swoop in, buy up these stocks, cover their short positions. The people they borrowed from might not be Diamond Handers, and end up selling to more Hedge Funds. When the short interest is only around 50%, you can't win with the Buy/Hold strategy. When the short interest is 50%, the short squeeze happens and you don't know it happens until it is over and the Hedge Funds have covered. You win by riding the wave up as Hedge Funds cover and then you get out near the top. That's the end of your ride. The ride doesn't just keep going up. You can only set the price when you own most of the market, and in this case, we don't. And on top of all of that, you also have people who are doing this with their bill money. The 1st of the month is coming up, that's a lot of rent needing paid. No shame in needing to sell so you can pay your bills. But, that's more shares that will flood the market. Probably a fraction of the actual amount of shares out there, but pennies add up to dollars eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

And those are the three scenarios in which you have a higher chance of losing than winning. Again, I cannot stress this enough: I **DO** believe a short squeeze can happen with GME. But I do not believe it is any of these three scenarios that will make it happen. I'm just tired of seeing people being fed these these  delusional optimistic claims that throw truth, history, and **REAL** DD &amp; common sense out the window, treating GME more like a PnD than an actual short squeeze.  it's okay to drink the Kool-aid, but maybe check to make sure it isn't spiked first.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I've been trying to reply to as many people as I can. If they took their time to indulge me, read  my post, and then spend their time writing a rebuttal to it, I wanted to respect that and give them a proper response, but it's getting a bit tiring and I have other things to do, so I will not be replying to any further comments.

388,"NrdRage's Friday DD: The Semis Play - not just the best you can do because of your low T that earned your wife a boyfriend. Trading chip shortages for top shelf tendies ($ON, $MRVL, $NXPI and a special surprise)",2021-02-26 21:26:21,"Hi  all, NrdRage here.  You might remember from such recent hits as ""buy   $PLTR 25p's as it's ripping here"", ""$CLNE June 13c's are literally free   money"", ""sell your $NCLH leaps in the 33 area and buy back later the   next day near 29"" (you're welcome, btw, as that trade probably saved   your week) and ""$NVDA June 580c's are going to make you rich"".  Today   we're gonna talk about the semiconductor chip space.

# Fluff content

""B...b....b.....BUT   NrdRAGE, you called  $NVDA, you already talked about them!""  I really   didn't.  Be honest, when I say chips/semis, the first things you think   of are $NVDA, $AMD, and $INTC.  Those are a wholly different thing than   what's on everybody's lips these days in relation to the vaunted   shortage, dealing in high performance silicon that is being produced at   full blast.  They're not going to be given a ticket to the feed trough   of free taxpayer money (supposing somebody informs Buyden that by chip    shortage, they're not indicating he needs to send his interns to  the   snack aisle of the grocery store to hoard.  Not a sure thing).

What   we're going to be talking about are the lower grade ASIC (application   specific chips) that are used more in infrastructure.  These are the   commodity level products that are used for things like the computers in   vehicles, mobile phones, wireless towers, specialized digital binary   money mining, and so Elon can implant them in chimps for evil genius   mind control experiments.

Your   bigger players here are going to be Taiwan Semi ($TSMC), Lam ($LRCX),   and ST ($STM).  2 of them are boring to trade, and Lam I'm not allowed   to talk about because of a conflict of interest w/ my VC.

# Let's talk about the government for a minute

OK,   be honest:  Half the reason you're here is because you heard Buyden is   going to dump loads of free money into these companies so they'll make   more chips.    After all, that's what CNBC has told you, and they  never  lie, right?  Right?  That's actually not what has happened in  Washington  (and, god help us, that line about Buyden thinking the chip  shortage  has to do with potatoes was only half joking).  What the  government has  done was signed up to spend money STUDYING why there's a  chip shortage.   The concern here is that even the US based semis  outsource out their  chip production to places like China and Vietnam,  and there's a growing  push to incentivize companies to bring production  domestically.  This is  especially spurred by $NXPI, who is  bottlenecking the automotive  industry by selling too much overseas.   Now, let's be honest:  It's  about 75% that all they do is waste money  on the study and never  actually make the investment, because getting  things like this done is  hard, and it's much easier to focus on social  issues that are already  covered by other laws but make it look like  something is getting done.   We have talkers and not doers right now,  that's just the nature of the  beast.

Speaking of, let's talk about....

# $NXPI - The Laggard

$NXPI   represents the only true foreign company we're going to examine today,   based in the Netherlands.  $MRVL is technically based in Bermuda, but   they're a US company (more on that later).  At the time of this  writing,  they're trading in the low 180's with a market cap of about 51  billion.   Their specialty is in chips that power infotainment systems  for cars.   So when you hear $F whine about how they can't get enough  chips,  they're low-key throwing shade at $NXPI.  The only reason  they're being  included in this list is because, as a big automotive  chipmaker, in  spite of the whole ""Buy American"" virtuing from the  current government,  if they spend money to ramp up manufacturing,  they're going to hand  money to $NXPI to set up factories here - and  will be dumb enough to not  make it contingent upon $NXPI keeping the  chips here in the country, so  they'll continue to sell them to the rest  of the world.

Looking  under the  hood, 47% of their money comes from cars, another 13% comes  from  phones, 20% comes from infrastructure (think wireless towers) and  about  20% of their money comes from selling chips to AMazon and Google  so  their virtual assistants can spy on you and listen to your wife's   boyfriend having sex on your dining table, with his balls rubbing right   against where your plate of Hungry Man frozen dinners sits when ~~he takes her out on a date~~   she goes out ""with the girls"".  Hey, I think one of those peas fell on   the table.  Pick it up and put it in your mouth.  Yeah, roll it around   in there, tastes like taint, doesn't it?  They're b asically a smaller   representation of Trevor's nuts - or a life size version of yours, you   dirty little bitch.  So one could say they've got a pretty good  product  mix and were one of the earlier players in the sector to  recover (yet  still lagged behind them overall), unlike the other  players we're gonna  talk about later.    Or, you could say that they're  a bunch of flip  flopping non-committers who create a schizophrenic  company in some weird  attempt to not be cyclical.  They trade at a  lower multiple to their  competitors, but this is largely due to the  fact that they're leveraged  more deeply than the rest.  The best  comparison to these guys would be $TXN if  you want something else to  track it by

**(Placeholder:  I might put a chart here later in an edit that compares price in relation to EBITDA)**

**(Placeholder:    I might put a chart here later in an edit that shows forward earnings   estimations based upon the increase in auto and IoT chip costs)**

What  do they think they're going to be long term?  That's the thing, it's  impossible to  tell if they're going to become a big player in cars or  IoT (they're not  compelling in infrastructure) because....

What   makes $NXPI interesting here in spite of the fact that everybody is   pissed at them for spreading themselves too thin is the fact that   they're such whores with who they sell to that they've become something   of an interesting M&amp;A speculative play, as it's entirely possible a   company just comes along and buys them to bolster their supply chain  for  chips once and for all.  In particular, there is a strong  indication  that Samsung has been kicking the tires for over a year.

OK, moving $ON (get it?  Dad joke)

# $ON - The Overachiever

$On   represents the only true domestic semi on this list, so if you're   playing the ""corporate welfare"" trade, you'll be interested here.  If   $NXPI is the BPD-afflicted ex who ""loves strongly and that's why she lit   your car on fire"", $ON is that super-focused new girlfriend who's   dating you because she knows somewhere in your contact list is a local   celebrity she can use to get her closer to being the Bachelorette after   she dumps your ass.  ON is all-in on 2 things:  the vehicle revolution   and 5G.  They're positioning themselves as the place to go to if you're   making EV's or autonomous cars, as they are focused on LIDAR sensory   chips and power management.  Why?  It's simple - ON was, is, and always   will be, interested in the highest margin businesses possible, cyclical   nature of them be damned.  Sure, they stick the tip of their johnson  in  the industrial sector, cross-selling their sensory chips for  purposes of  machine vision (think automated Amazon warehouse part  pickers), but  it's not something they spend a lot of time on.  Does  this strategy work  (at least for right now?).  Let's look under the  hood.

They  had a MASSIVE beat  last quarter and then upgraded forward guidance by  8%, and this stonk  has already had quite a run - more than 30% to date,  which has outpaced  its competitors by almost double.  The automotive  section of their  portfolio rose 17% and represents about 33% of their  revenue at this  point, but it's clear to see that if we have this  conversation in a  year, that number will be well over 50%.  Their  infrastructure revenue  (wireless towers) lagged, but that was due to  their vendors, and  actually represents a forward opportunity.  They beat  in spite of a  major part of their portfolio dumping.  So the answer is  yes.

How?    Simple:  Mind control and cancer technology from the lizard people   who's secret society is bustling under the ice of Antarctica, aka 5G.    The telecoms, as a result of the virus, really slowed down their rollout   of 5G last year.  It was suspected that might carry through this year,   as well.  You may have noticed the news a day or two ago that $T and  $VZ  caught downgrades because of unexpectedly high prices paid in the  most  recent bandwidth spectrum auctions.  That changes all of that.   Since  everybody had to pay so much more for the spectrum space, look  for these  players to be very aggressive in trying to shorten the ROI  frame on  those expenses by aggressively expanding out their 5G  infrastructure.   There are 3 companies that this is very good news for:   $SWKS (another  stock I can't comment on because of conflict of  interest, so do your own  DD with them), $ON, and the next participant  in this, which we'll get  to in a moment.  So there are about to be a  lot more chips from $ON in  your kid's school, shooting ovarian cancer  rays into that boy.  You  likely won't see this reflected on the balance  sheet until their Q3  earnings, but since everybody knows it's coming,  it's going to get baked  into the price.  Which is why you're very  likely to see a melt up over  the next months.

The   one thing that sets $ON apart from the rest of the equities on this   list is that they're not a a mini-fab.  That meaning, they're not a   company that simply outsources chip production to other people   (overseas) and who has shown a willingness to keep some production in   house.  Matter of fact, their CEO recently came out and affirmed that he   wants to maintain a balance between outsourcing and in-house.  Which   means when it's time to get some of that sweet, sweet taxpayer money to   build out US production, they'll have their hands out.

TL:DR:    If you're bullish on EV's, self-driving cars, and the Illuminati,   you're bullish on $ON.  If you're playing the gubmint corporate cheese   play, $ON

# $MRVL - The Duke Brothers

Marvell   is functionally a US company (Santa Clara), but is technically   headquartered in Bermuda because they're filthy tax dodgers.  If you're   one of those ""ethical investors"", stay far away from this company,   because they're as dirty as they come in a lot of ways. They also trade   at a lower multiple than the others.  On the upside, if the government   starts offering money to ""Build American, sell to China"", they will   elbow their way to the front of the line to take the free money...and   then build a 3 person operation somewhere in Iowa that makes hard drive   chips and pocket the rest, which will definitely pad their bottom line.

One   thing that's different with $MRVL here is that they completely   outsource their chip production right now, so if they were to take   government money, they would have to build their infrastructure from the   ground up and figure out how to make it work.  Anyways, let's look   under the hood:

40%  of their  revenue comes from the storage sector.  Meaning the lion's  share of  their money is legacy, selling chips that go in hard drives.   On the  consumer side, it's in platter discs, their SSD play is in the   enterprise space because they're not high performance chips.    BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-RIIIIIIIIING.   ""But NrdRage!"", I can hear you saying   ""That means they're gonna be huge in the cloooooouuuuuuud!"".   Sure,   except margins in t he cloud computing space keep shrinking at   exponential rates as it becomes more commoditized, so it's a lot like   investing in EMC in 2014.  They've invested heavily in automotive in the   last year, but they're a day late and a billion dollars short there.    It will take at least 3 years before that investment starts bearing   fruit, so they're not an interesting play in that aspect, and likely   would use that free taxpayer money to try and close their gap there,   because they weren't forward thinking in that regard.  They've been   active in acquisitions lately, most recently buying Inphi, which serves   to just attempt to keep up with $NVDA in the ARM chip space for data   centers.  For the record, they cannot keep up with $NVDA in that space,   so don't think you're paying for a dominant player there.    It's a  high  profit sector, but not exciting and dependent on their continued   contract winning in the whitebox space.  All this sounds like they're   big spenders, but that's not really true.  They've actually been   excessively cautious in leveraging debt, which is why they're so far   behind in the auto space.  As only 4 or 5% of their revenue came from   things like industrial or IoT, MRVL is actively winding down t hose   sectors of their business, and abandoning t hem.

What   they are that's interesting, however, is almost exclusively a 5G play,   and in that regard, they are fucking rock stars.   5G alone represents   about a billion dollars per quarter as things get more heated there,   because they're not just a domestic 5G play - they're really well   positioned to be the dominant chip maker in both the Land of the Hentai   Sun and for the Europoors.  If you're investing in $MRVL, this is the   SOLE reason you're doing so, and it's a compelling case.  There's no   chart data I can provide as-yet that can accurately project their   positioning in the market in this area, but rest assured, when that data   can be quantified, they're going to be a big time player in it.   Matter  of fact, just yesterday they announced they were partnering with   Fujitsu in a 5G baseband agreement with regards to Fujitsu's base   stations.  Bad day to announce that news, since the best performing   stonks were the ones that only closed down 1%.

# So, to summarize:

* The   entire sector is very cyclical, and presently it represents a perfect   storm of an upgrade in telecommunications technology, automotive   advancements, and IoT
* Don't   bet on them just because you hear Buyden is virtue signalling some   bullshit about solving Ford's chip crisis, because it's probably going   to be another example of lifetime politicians being all talk and no   action
* They're   all healthy financially, none of them are heavily shorted, and  pressure  is to the upside, albeit not in any sort of extreme adrenaline releasing way
* If   you really want to bet on government, the real bet here is the stimmy   money getting handed out again.  DC is basically telling everybody to  go  buy a new phone with the next installment of checks, and those  phones  are going to be 5G capable and the people are going to want to  leverage  that.
* Don't tell the lizard people I know about their secret base

# That's all well and good, fucker, but how do I play them?  Can I FD?

$NXPI:    You actually can.  You can expect daily movement of between 2-4% with   some regularity, with a ITM Delta of about 58 and a Gamma approaching 2   and a half (spoiler alert: All these are going to have garbage gammas,   just a nature of the industry).  Don't go crazy out of the money, but   weeklies are absolutely something you can do here.

$ON:    You can't really.  This is really more of a melt up play.  You don't   necessarily have to play leaps, but weeklies are gonna be a bad idea.    Stay close to in the money and go 2 or 3 months out at a time.    Currently I'm sitting on 4/16 41c's, which I will roll over into June   calls as we get closer to expiration.  You always want to stay a little   in front of these dudes.  ITM Delta is almost always sub-50 and Gamma  is  often times about 12 short term.  Stay a little ahead of them and it   improves dramatically.

$MRVL:    They're OK there, but like $ON, you're probably going to want to stay   ahead of them, though you can fiddle with this a bit.  Delta is pretty   good, but the gamma is absolute dogshit.  If you target something about   10% one direction or another, you should be happy as long as you pick   the right side of the coin flip.

# Outlook and Price Targets:

$NXPI:    I'm neutral on them, bordering on bullish.  They're the biggest  reason  we keep hearing about this silicon crisis right now, but they're  being  coy about whether the reason they're not keeping up is because  they  don't or won't produce enough or if it's just because they won't  sell  enough to us.  They represent a potential speculative play if  somebody  who really needs chips for their business decides to just  solve the  problem by throwing money at it and bringing that development  in house.   3 month price target 200-210.

$ON:    Bullish.  They're laser focused and well positioned to take advantage   of all the highest margin business in this cycle, and as the demand  for  these products ramps up, their outlook is going to exponentially  outpace  everybody else in the space, even the chips I didn't talk about  today  (exempting gaming chip makers).  45 in the short term, but if  you manage  to stick your dick in your wife when she's sleeping one  night and  dribble your Downs-afflicted swimmers into her, you could  very well see  75-80 by the time that chromosome hoarding bundle of joy  licks your  wife's vag.  I expect to see this one in triple digits at  some point.  A  darling.

$MRVL:    Bullish for 5G ONLY.  Once you start seeing the telecoms advertise   they've got 97% nationwide 5G coverage (and research studies to back   that up), their cycle will be over and they'll go back to legacy   revenue, but expect big things from them as $T and $VZ try to keep up   with T-Mo's breakneck pace.  Short term price of $75, long term...eh,   whatever.

# Positions:

$NXPI:   I don't hold a position with them, and don't anticipate doing so  unless a strong momentum trade forms.  I think they can move, but  they're not interesting to me.  Some of you will like them, especially  since you can FD them because of the occasional spikes and craters.

$ON:    1000 4/16 $41cs and 500 7/16 44c's.  I also have 85,000 shares at   30.59.  I grabbed some weeklies for next week at 38 during yesterday's   bloodbath, but that was just me feeling cute.  You can't really shadow   trade that since it's already back up to 40.25.

$MRVL:  2000 5/21 $65c's and 50,000 shares at 33.35

# NRDRAGE DOUBLE FEATURE:  BONUS ""DD"": $UTZ

I   keep making those ""Buyden hears chip shortage and thinks Frito Lay is   in trouble"" jokes, but the thing is, I'm only half kidding.    That has   nothing to do with this equity other than it got me thinking about my   favorite snack brands.  A week ago, I had no idea this company was even   publicly traded -  I always knew them as a family run northeast niche   thing.  One thing I did notice, however, was a couple of years ago  their  chips started showing up in grocery stores near my Colorado  homes,  which I had been assuming meant they were having things shipped  from the  East coast.  And, when we spent a couple of weeks at our LA  home  recently so I could get in some motorcycle riding and away from  the  snow, I found them on the shelves out there, too.  Somewhere along  the  way, they decided to become a national brand and have started   penetrating markets all over the place.  I have no idea what their   financials look like or any other solid DD besides knowing that they're   fucking delicious and, if you're a believer in the product, then   believing in the company shouldn't be hard.  So I bought a thousand   shares at 24.35 in solidarity with them.  Then I saw Cramer hyped them a   couple of nights ago and cursed myself for starting to turn into a   shitty Boomer.  Maybe they become a big player in the snack food space   on their own, maybe a company like $PEP comes along and buys them out.    Regardless, if you like the product, go out and buy some equity, you  fat  fuck.  Plus, there's always a non-zero chance Joe gives them a  bailout  by mistake.

How big is the ball of shit?,2021-02-28 00:53:32,"Schwab had a bug on their platform that caused double selling and double buying in client cash accounts. Yes, it is a fucked up disaster. And yes, I'm already talking to lawyers so please none of the ""lawyer up"" shit, I know what I'm doing.

I'm just here to tell you the story.

This bug caused my 401(k) cash account to be out $180k. See my Sunday post last week if you want details: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a\_bug\_in\_schwab\_caused\_my\_retirement\_account\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loffqz/a_bug_in_schwab_caused_my_retirement_account_to/)

Forget about my account though. Look at the comments. This was me posting randomly on /r/stocks and without prompting for it, I got over 60 comments that said the same thing happened to them.

Let's figure this out with some (admittedly imprecise) napkin math:

* Suppose Schwab is \~5% of total stock market volume.
* U.S. Trading volume is maybe $1.250T (between Nasdaq + NYSE)
* Suppose the bug affects 5% of trades on Schwab. (This number has to be big enough account for the fact that so many comments appeared on my post)
* Suppose each illegal trade on average moves 10% before it gets resolved.
* Schwab is on the hook for any of these price movements that result in losses (half the price movements, because half were gains and some customers probably made out like bandits?)
* 1250000000000 \* 0.05 \* 0.05 \* 0.1 \* 0.5

**= $156m per day?** in what I'm referring to as ""a giant ball of shit""

Important points:

1. Schwab could be losing something on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars per day. Is the bug fixed? I have not seen any announcements about it. It's been over 30 days and I still haven't gotten a clear response from Schwab about my own personal issue.
2. This has been a problem for months, according to the comments. Read through the comments on my post in /r/stocks.
3. Schwab only has about $20B in total equity (according to Wikipedia, 2018)
4. I could have easily left GME naked short in my account. I don't know what Schwab would have done, or how many accounts have gone naked short, and stayed that way...

It still does not appear that the markets have priced this event in, yet. At best, Schwab lost some money. At worst, Schwab is actually bankrupt. I (currently) don't think it's very likely that they're bankrupt, but I do believe the markets are mispricing their stock.

**Schwab: If you don't want us speculating about how big this ball of shit is, then come out and say exactly how big it is. And tell us where the ""fix it"" money is coming from. Not client assets, I hope?**

Stay tuned for some more traditional DD in the coming days/weeks.

406,GME IS A MEME STOCK,2021-02-28 09:51:26,"I’ve seen outrageous posts and bets here recently, and people have lost money because they have no idea what they are doing. So, I’m just going to leave this here and post it again, or a long version throughout the week to lower this madness and save people from losing money. I honestly hope newcomers see this...

Tl;dr: STOP OVERTHINKING

Treat GME like a meme stock and buy on the dip. If you buy options, set the expiration for end of month/April. Doesn’t matter what the strike price is because of IV Crush. You can sell anytime without effecting the cause (always pay yourself, keeps your head clear). If you sell before stimmies, buy back in. Gamma is pending. 

Longer version:

There will be a squeeze and a gamma squeeze this month (March). Follow the money/word of mouth. The real catalysts are social media and upcoming stimulus. 

GME is a meme stock, meaning it does not function like other stocks. It’s abnormal. Therefore, it has high IV and is constantly in a state of IV Crush. This means if you buy options, it doesn’t matter what your strike price is. All that matters is the expiration. Set longer expirations for your calls/puts so you can sell whenever you feel like paying yourself and buy the shares to support the cause. 

GME being a meme is not a bad thing. In fact, it’s why we can do this. You don’t need an over complicated strategy to make profit here. The stock will rise and gamma when the little people are given 600 billion dollars to invest. Hedge funds know this and will use this as the opportunity to win the war. This isn’t new information. This has been in play since January, possibly even before. Why did DFV set his calls to expire in April? Why are hedgies repositioning themselves? Why did shorties call foul play against us in January? Play it smart and safe and you won’t lose a dime and will make unbelievable profits. 


Remember that we are small fish in a gigantic pond that has existed even before DFV decides to make his move. I can elaborate on this later. While we may be small fish, the great equalizer is the stimulus. Some of you don’t remember this: but shorties and hedgers cries foul play, blaming the government for giving people the power to take their profits because the stimulus gave millions of people the same buying power as hedge funds. Fueled by word of mouth, which travels at the speed of light because of social media, it created an explosion that they could not control, so they shut down the game. It will happen again. 

I think people are overthinking this and coming up with convoluted plans, when all you have to do is buy and hold. Sell your options, but hold your shares. Rinse and repeat. It’s what hedge funds are doing. It’s all there if you look at the charts AND the options. Look at the whole picture and follow the money. 

Cash app finally added GameStop to purchase, meaning ANYBODY can buy the stock, AND the the stimulus is on its way. Put it together. Don’t look for a made up catalyst. It’s right there in front of all of us. It happens with hertz, and it happened in January. Don’t underestimate the power of the Apes and social media. 

I left a lot of things unexplained but you get the picture. Also, for those of you who are spreading the word, keep it up and ramp it up before the stimmies drop. Doing God’s work (not religious just an expression). I’ll see you all in Andromeda (galaxy far away because this is going intergalactic). 

This is just my opinion, trying to save lives not give financial advise. If it sounds this way that’s interpretation. 

I eat crayons and huff gas fumes for fun!

I hope all newcomers see this...

Edit: thank you all so much! I am replying to you Damn apes as fast as I can! Am I officially an Ape now? I love you guys and want ALL OF US to prosper! I left some things out like how “GameStop is a cow that produces infinite milk and that’s why shorties keep coming back to ‘squeeze’” but I thought it was implied lol my B. I was planning on making a more in-depth version of this post soon though!

Look, I’m not going to make you wrong for asking these types of questions because they are rational questions - but WSB wasn’t founded on rationality - it was founded on YOLOing our children’s college funds away and making memes about it. This is a MOONSHOT; not a sure bet - if you can’t handle the fire get out of the kitchen (aka sub to r/investing and get a nice safe index fund).

Here are the facts -&gt; They NEED our shares. We are seeing them BLATANTLY use every trick in the book (naked shorts, keeping prices artificially low, blocking trading, etc) - in fact, they’re not even pretending or hiding it anymore. It’s out in the public - anyone who cares to see it can see it. But here’s the thing: despite all their tricks, at the end of the day - they still NEED our shares. At this point, it is a battle of attrition; they can only keep up their charade for so long before they literally have nothing left to short and they have to buy back their shorted positions (side note: I’m a retard and this prob isn’t exactly how it works but close enough so just fucking go with it for now). By holding (think Articuno chilling in cave [Seafoam Island] status) we lose NOTHING. If people keep buying/selling back and forth, it is playing into their hand. They want us to get bored and sell - behind all their dirty tricks, it sums up to them just trying to get us to sell - either through fear or boredom. Do what you got to do - but I am holding until the bitter fucking end.

Tldr; don’t get fatigue/boredom/fear from this - that’s what they want. Take time away and come back fresh. And most importantly - HOLD

Edit: Include specific location of Articuno’s YOLO spot

417,Shorts are literally running out of bullets.,2021-02-27 17:35:00,"Hi fellow retards!

My hypothesis and granted this may have already been postulated here is that the hedgers had enough liquidity in Jan to short GME and temper the price back down. Now it appears that they’ve run out of liquidity and are forced to sell their income generating securities to continue to short in an act of desperation. 

As a parallel - consider it from a mortgage perspective they’re trying to stave of foreclosure by first burning through savings and now they’re selling off their valuable possessions. So they can’t borrow off margin, they are out of cash and now they’re selling off their source of income. Which by the way hurts the passive investors that like their ETF stocks, but the hedges don’t give a shit. They just want to short GME no matter the cost. 

The mortgage allegory reminds me of say the 2008 crisis - I used to be a loan officer and the exotic sub prime mortgages were horse shit. You could qualify for a mortgage back then with a DTI (debt to income ratio) of 65%. For those unaware DTI is the ratio of your GROSS income vs the PITI of your home and all revolving and installment debt on your credit report. It does not factor in payments for utilities, food, gas. So they assume people can afford a house with the 35% of gross fucking income after their monthly debt is paid? No. Now the opposite is happening again. They deserve this for their insatiable greed and lack of compassion for anyone but themselves. 

Hedgies have no cash and selling their income generating stocks to continue this fight. Eventually they’ll run out of those and will have no choice but to cover no matter the price. They fucking deserve it. From their ashes I hope we can build a market that is free and open without their influence and heavy shorting a float will be illegal. If I want to pay x dollars for a stock, that’s my business. Shorting is bullshit. Think a company is overvalued? Then close your position and find another fucking stock. The government should be appalled. Trying to BK a company not only puts thousands out of a job, but reduces the income tax stream from them to the gov’t. Not only that but now they’re on the govt payroll via unemployment. All this so they can profit off of destruction. Fuck. You. Long post I’m sorry.

TLDR: hedgies are going to burn for their atrocities. 

My position: 914 shares of GME and one 3/5 $100 call. The shares I’d be willing to part with for say a minimum of 4 figures per share. Maybe 5 who knows? 42,069 per share has a nice ring to it. I like the stock and this isn’t financial advice. Hedge funds are cucks."

427,"(GME DD) Why the Volkswagen Comparison is much more inaccurate than you thought, but in A DIFFERENT WAY",2021-02-27 18:36:58,"Hey folks!
I’m not exactly one to do too much digging through numbers, but over the last few days I’ve just thought of something using what seems to me to be a fairly simple and watertight explanation for why those constant VW comparisons we’ve finally started to escape from may not have been overplaying GME performance, but actually UNDERPLAYING it.

Apologies for the lack of rockets, but I’m not writing this on a phone. Have fun with all the text:

So. The VW short squeeze spent a lot of time pretending to be a model for GME, with many trying to compare two very different graphs to predict future performance. There seemed to be a very common response to these VW shills, which was often along the lines of: “well, yeah there are more GME shares shorted than there were VW shares, but since the effective GME float is (whether made of original or duplicate counterfeit shares [again, reference the wonderful document which was shared around our community some weeks ago]) significantly larger than the 1% or so of VW shares there was, in effect the 13% short interest on VW led to a 13:1 short:float ratio meanwhile GME would, by nature of its much larger float, have a smaller ratio despite the fact it has far, far greater short interest (math 101).
I accepted this for the last few weeks, but recently after trying to explain this to my mother through an actual example I came up with a very interesting differentiating factor which no one has really mentioned:




TL;DR:
You can cover INFINITE short positions with ONE real share, as long as you make an infinite number of transactions, but you can only cover ONE naked short position with the ONE created counterfeit share.



Let’s explain that for those that don’t immediately get the logic.
Imagine you are a hedge fund who shorted VW. Presumably, the vast majority if not ALL of the shorts executed went the following way:

you start with ~0~ shares
you borrow one from a broker
you now have ~1~ shares
you sell that share, completing your short
you now have ~0~ shares

Now imagine the short squeeze happens.
And let’s say there are 100 people like you who all shorted one real share each. The thing is, you can buy a share off the market, returning your total to ~1~ shares, before you return it to ~0~ shares by giving it to your broker. Your broker can now sell that share to other shorts, and they to other shorts, etc.
The point being, when working with real shares, an infinite number of transactions can theoretically clear an infinite number of shorts (while still driving the price up).

Now here’s the kicker, which has been tormenting me over the last few days as I try not to get my hopes too high:
Imagine you are an immensely idiotic hedge fund, named Delvin Capital. 
You go ahead and do some sexy naked shorting.

you start with ~0~ shares
you DO NOT BORROW ONE from your broker!
you sell a “share”, promising to fulfill the step you just skipped “sometime soonish maybe”
you now have ~ -1 ~ shares!!

Now the squeeze happens, as above. But this time, the 100 other friends of yours are similarly positioned, and also made naked short positions. Notice the problem when you try to cover using the above strategy: you buy that one share off the market to cover your short. Notice: your total is not positive, but only ~0~, since you were actually negative to begin with! 
Thus, you can’t give these shares to your broker, or another fund, since doing so would only return you to a negative value: 

THE POINT BEING, naked shorts, unlike normal PG-13 shorts, have what is effectively a 1:1 COVER RATIO
The whole idea of hedgies rapidly trading shares back and forth with each other to cover is, as far as I can reason, IMPOSSIBLE. Maybe that’s why they haven’t squeezed yet?

Here’s where VW vs. GME comes back in, though. GME’s nominal institutional ownership is over 100%. Furthermore, with all the recently unearthed ETF shorts added in, GME shorts are pretty obviously over 100%. When you consider that, with retail NOT EVEN FACTORED INTO THE EQUATION, this 1:1 cover ratio is completely in feasible for shorts, their desperation seems to have been, if anything, undervalued this whole time. The ONLY WAY THEY CAN COVER NAKED SHORTS is buy repurchasing an almost IDENTICAL NUMBER OF SHARES, and it is THIS FACT that they are not just able to purchase a few shares and move them around like they might otherwise have been able to but would literally have to buy more shares than exist *WITHOUT TRADING THE SAME ONES BACK AND FORTH* which makes this fucking crazy.
Assuming retail and bullish institutions hold, it is not just exceedingly costly, but impossible for them to cover.


If you’ve gotten this far, congratulations.
Now think about that again.


Effective TL;DR 2.0:

People asked what the price would be like if demand is infinite and supply minuscule?
Probably pretty fucking high. VW may be a good example.

But here’s MY question:
What will the price be like if demand is infinite and it is literally impossible for supply to ever meet it? 
VW is definitely not a good example. If anything, it’s an understatement. I think THIS is what actually makes GME something we’ve never, ever seen before in all of financial history.


Please reflect on this and correct me if I’m wrong. I hope I’m not.
Joy to all,

DD on where to invest next.",2021-02-27 23:13:01,"I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.

By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.

Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/

First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! 

Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. 

Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. 

By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.

Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.

When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.

UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!

Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.

Space Ape out

TLDR: 

* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU
* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI
* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot
* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds
* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon

And consider if on top of that, there have been so many discussions and threads about shorting it after IPO, and it had reached the media and media started reporting that a large, large amount of people will short the company after IPO, scaring every single instutional investor into investing in the first place. What would it mean to the company? It means goodbye see ya never.

I think it can be a self fulfilling prophecy. Market these days are based on sentiment, and if theres so many upvoted threads popping about shorting the company before IPO and it reaches the media and the media starts reporting it, its game over for them. Potential investors will be wary to enter, and new retail investors wont even sign up new accounts in the first place.

Edit: as pointed out by u/treehugchamp shorting has its risks. So discuss, what would be the best way to cause a big impact. Shorting and buying calls? Buying puts? Box spread quad witching? How do we really, really, really, fuck em up?

Some people believe that karma comes to those who deserve it. My belief is that we, both individually and as a group, have the choice to be agents of said karma, and can expedite the process."

442,Why Melvin and the other HF’s basically have no chance of winning...IMO!,2021-02-27 14:50:50,"There is only one answer as to how on Earth 140% shorting was allowed. This is due to the concept of naked shorting...

this in simple terms is when shorters (like big institutions like Melvin) decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders (basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders) and this lead to 140% shorting which lead to phantom shares. This is all highly illegal except for one exception (to the best of my belief (youtube it and read up on the SEC to confirm otherwise don’t believe me)... an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit.

Why does this even matter? It’s because through these phantom shares, they are able to manipulate the ‘failure to deliver’ system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off - they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off - they belief this hype is temporary that will pass, they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more... 

Think about it, no honestly think about it...everyone was gunning for $1,000 the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way? It’s because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares, the news media penetrating that the interest in GME was over and these Failure to deliver and ladder attacks. The Majority of us are still holding, holding through -80% and didn’t sell when it went down why? Well it’s simple. ITS BECAUSE THE SQUEEZE HAS NOT BEEN SQUOZE. 

Now back to naked short selling, this is market manipulation at its finest BUT, of course GameStop is no longer dead. Through the great help of Ryhan Cohen’s and WSB the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the HF’s as long as we manage to hold. Shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open. Which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb Melvin dry. The more hype there is the more these interests go up. And that’s our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before us...it’s a great time to be alive!

And although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the 100% mark. I think that the final 40% of shorts won’t be able to be deductible since it’s made up of phantom shares. Melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising. This stock has been shorted for years! But that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist. it’s corruption vs the people. Unity will prevail if we stay strong together 💎

450,Is $PLTR still a Buy after insider stock sell off?,2021-02-28 03:50:17,"Palantir Technologies’ 40% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter came in well above prior expectations and management’s guidance. The company is also benefiting from the transition to a software-based firm and its efforts to more efficiently deliver and scale its products.

 

In the quarter, government sales increased by 85% and commercial revenue grew by 4% year over year. While commercial growth was slower than anticipated, Palantir’s 2021 focus of expanding its direct sales force and channel partnerships to accelerate this segment. Palantir is showing strong momentum with growing sales and margins with its existing customer base, diversification among its revenue streams, and ability to land new clients. Average revenue per customer increased by 41% year over year to $7.9 million. Annual revenue from top 20 customers increased by 34% year over year to $663 million, while the customer concentration from those top 20 customers declined to 61%.from 67% the year before. Palantir closed more than 21 deals in the quarter worth at least $5 million, with 10 of those worth at least $10 million. Adjusted gross and operating margins of 84% (81% last quarter) and 32% (25% previous quarter), respectively, were ahead of our prior expectations as revenue outpaced expenses, Palantir lowered its cloud hosting costs, and go to market efficiency gains are decreasing upfront software deployment costs.




Palantir is well suited to help organizations consolidate and harness the power of data. Between a leading position in the government sector with the U.S. and its allies and the opportunity for Palantir to expand into commercial enterprise applications, this narrow-moat company is poised for robust growth and margin expansion in the years ahead. The uncovering of insights and the easy integration of data is a largely untapped market due to legacy data sets saved around the world, various data formats, the uptick in cloud-based resources, and the proliferation of the need for real-time access via distributed devices. 



Palantir established itself by working with the U.S. government intelligence and defense sectors to integrate military data into a consolidated dashboard, and then drove actionable outcomes by uncovering hidden patterns with artificial intelligence support. Its Gotham software platform is used across various government sectors within the U.S. and among its allies.



Palantir sells its Foundry software platform to commercial organizations, targeting large-scale data operations. Holistically combining data has typically involved consulting alongside in-house customized development efforts for enterprises; however, Palantir's commercial offering is attempting to change the industry's procurement motion. Its software is used in a variety of industries and Palantir's aim is to be the data operating system for companies and industries. By stitching together various seemingly disparate components of the airline industry, as one example, Palantir has made inroads to become a data platform standard for the industry, and looks to other industries to achieve similar results. 



Tldr; 

 Palantir could be the answer to the problems that governments and commercial customers face in successfully integrating large-scale, disparate data in a cohesive and coherent manner to gain insight and drive actions. Palantir has a strong government business and is diversifying into potentially higher-margin commercial markets; it could become the data operating system for companies and industries. The company has substantial margin expansion opportunities via improvements in deployment costsband by offering commercially available solutions to prospects.

452,New Video from Bruce Frommert describes what he thinks is going on in GME. Worth a watch. tldr in post.,2021-02-27 14:30:52,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello beautiful apes.

For those of you so smooth-brained that you've not heard of Uncle Bruce, then allow me to use my tastiest crayon to enlighten you. Stock Markets with Bruce has been a stalwart of the GME saga and the old silverback has been live streaming throughout the whole damn thing. The guy deserves all the support and praise you can give him.

Onto his DD, go to the youtube channel 'Stock Markets With Bruce' and view the video 'GameStop GME Uncle Bruce Says I think I Know Whats Going On! Stock Markets In Plain English'. I can't link it sadly.

**tldr**; Hedgefunds with short positions are buying 2x(numOfShorts) call options deep in the money to not only cover their short positions, but then end up long GME. There are more calls available than tradable stock (due to naked call contracts) and thus they can then join-in the diamond hand rocket while the Chicago Market Makers (options writers) have to scramble around trying to buy more stock than exists. All this while the newly longed HF's slowly leak shares to the MM's at ever increasing prices.

Does this mean the shorts are now coming in to bat for us? I'm more than happy for smart money to yeet this thing to the moon, I'm here for tendies, nothing more, nothing less.

If I've wrongly interpreted the DD and you've been triggered, first well done for watching Bruce's video, give him a thumbs up while you're there. Second, don't get angry at me, hate yourself for taking financial advice from an ape on the internet. P.S. If you are my wife's BF then I'm sorry... I don't know what for, I just am.

My position: long 11.57 GME @ $105

Credit goes to Bruce Frommert, of Stock Markets With Bruce. If you feel enlightened and want to share some love, please direct it at him!

Edit: obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**tldr for the tldr**: This thing is now decided by the options market. Hodl

456,"Dear Apes, why was Rocket’s dividend strategy genius? I’ll try to dumb it down for you fuck tards.",2021-02-27 18:18:41,"Happy Saturday Tards. Oh and a heart-felt go fuck yourself to the WSB mods! Ban me again you cunts, I don’t care 🥰

Apes, lmk if I am missing anything with this thesis:

When I first heard RKT was doing a dividend I was pissed - no true growth companies pay out dividends. It’s for boomer companies like XOM or CVX. But this one-time special dividend  is VASTLY different. Why? Well strap on your helmet and kneebow pads and I’ll tell you fece-tossing apes.

RKT insiders own 95% of $RKT shares. So 95% of the dividend payout is going to Rocket insiders (75% of which is owned by Dan Gilbert, the reincarnation of King Haramabe himself). 

$RKT insiders are literally paying themselves; they can use the cash they pay themselves to buy-back stock while forcing shorts to pay a dividend and enticing investors to buy in simultaneously. If you tree-swinging Orangutans didn’t already know, Rocket attempted to deter shorts during November’s earnings call by adding a $1 billion dollar buy back. 

It didn’t work. Shorts only continued to pile in, but here’s the thing. Rocket hasn’t used a PENNY of that buyback. They are still fully loaded with ammunition to fuck over the shorts with a billion dollars to buy back shares.  $1B buyback is OVER HALF OF THEIR PUBLIC FLOAT. 

BuT iF RkT Is So UnDeRvALuEd, WhY HaVeN’T tHeY BoUgHt BaCk AnY ShArEs ?

GREAT QUESTION my jello-brained friend, now wipe the drool off the side of your mouth and I’ll tell you. 

The reason Rocket hasn’t bought back any shares is because, companies are unable to exercise a buy back if they are holding non-public, material information(their new partnership with Etrade and Morgan Stanley). I assumed before the ER that they hadn’t bought back any shares for this reason and still believe it to be true. Now that the partner announcement is behind them, they can fire away.

Rocket insiders will receive $2B from the special dividend which is more than enough to cover the buy back plan they announced back in November. 

Initially, I wanted an increase in the amount of buy back but then I realized that the special dividend may be one of the smartest moves they could make. This move is very calculated - it may complement their buy back strategy tremendously, force shorts to pay more money on top of the 80% interest they are paying to borrow shares, and also motivate retards like you to ditch GME and buy a real winner.

BuT YoU CaNt SqUeEzE a 40 BiLlIoN DoLlAR CoMpAnY:

Don’t focus on the size of the company. Focus on the size of their public float. Which makes them a FUBO sized company in a sense, and they are a company that is actually sustainable and will continue growing. We all know how GameStop’s ending will be written. Patient GME shorts will end up making money because GME will eventually fall back to its worth/value. But Rocket is different. When Rocket hits the $30s, it will never see the $20s again. There is nothing for shorts to “wait out” on this play. I’m not gay, but I am down to fuck some shorts in the ass, now who’s with me?



TLDR: dividend and buy back plan = more 💴 for more 🦍. More 💰 = more 🍌. Apes likey bananas 🍌


Edit: if RKT hits $30, 5k will be donated to special Olympics. 10k if it hits $40. To those who have family members who are special needs, I apologize - I am merely speaking the language of my targeted audience (WSB)

459,$AMC Cup and Handle Formation,2021-02-28 01:59:20,"So when the cup began forming, it retraced approximately 50% (which given the volatility is totally understandable).  The bottom of the cup was rather smooth, indicating a strong period of consolidation and accumulation.  The cup formation also began immediately after a new trend (the boom up), meaning it's a strong contender for a continuation of the previous trend if the cup completes.

In order for the cup to complete, the price needs to rise above the neckline, which is about $10-11 area.  If this happens, chartists and algo buyers will see the buy signal and volume should come in.

What time period are we looking at?  I'd say we have till Friday to get it to the neckline.  If enough contracts are executed Monday, we could see enough volume to get there.

There's also the issue of the gap to fill from the sell off from Feb 2.  The area ranges from $10-$15, giving us further reason for an increase in price.  If we do, the breakout in price should occur from there.

Positions: March 5 $15 calls and missionary with the HF's wife.

TLDR/eat crayons:  Stock price needs to get to $11 within next few days to trigger boomer astrologists and robot programs in to mindlessly purchasing.  More buyers = higher price.

This Does not mean that the upcoming price will skyrocket like it did in January. It is only a comparison of the volume with the open and closing prices. 

This is also not financial advice and I am not telling you to buy, sell or hold. 

To any journalists/reporters that reads these threads and wants to claim that this price movement is due to a bunch of retail investors I would like to respond with a healthy FUCK YOU and that you should know better that the amount of volume that is happening is not because of the retards here.

477,The squeeze is going to be way bigger than before.,2021-02-28 11:26:33,"
1. Since according to IBKR and their boss, last spike was only due to gamma, means most of them weren’t even covering at the time.
2. Remember that they had to inject 33 MILLION SHARES(MINIMUM) just to keep the price down last Friday, alone that’s 66% SI if you think that they actually covered all that shit last time. (But if you thought that, that begs the question why did the price spike again, and why are they still using every dirty tactic to keep it down below strike prices? I.E. Cramer, short ladders, crying hedgies)
3. Many say that the 50 million volume during the spike was the squeeze but if you believed at least premise 2 which is backed up by data that is being monitored and cannot be avoided by hedgies. Then we had 140% SI at start, got down to 40% SI if they covered at all, and jumped to 106% SI last Friday on their push to &lt;100
TLDR: Hedgies are fucked even in the worst case scenario we are 106% SI still. We ain’t finished yet boys. They could still play the long game and cover before key strike and sell prices are met though. What does that mean??? They know 800 was an important target for us so they might only cover till it jumps to 700. They know 1000 is where a lot of us may start shaving off so they might cut it at 900. 69420 is a popular price they think people will pull out so they pull out at 60-65. 
In conclusion: they may think their pullout game is good enough to avoid getting the ass blast of a century, but if that were true, they wouldn’t have gotten buttfucked to begin with."

481,Weird Stuff Afoot 1,2021-02-28 06:27:33,"The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has gone from next to nothing (**1.1%**) at the start of February to almost next to nothing (**1.4%**) now on Friday. So...

All us retards better sell our undervalued holdings just as the economy is breaking out.  Really?

Coronavirus cases have **dropped 73%** down to 69 k on a 7-day average last Friday from a peak of 259 k for a 7-day average in January. Wow.  And now **over 20%** of the US has been **vaccinated**.  Combined with up to **30% exposed** to the virus, that means **half the US is already immune**!

And so... should we retards dump our stocks now?

In addition:Last summer after the economy crashed, the price of crude oil (WTI) was **under $40** a barrel.  Now it is **over $60** a barrel for a **50% increase.**  And yet the stock prices of oil and gas firms are **flat**!?!

**CVX** Chevron was $100 on June 8 and last Friday it was $100. **XOM** Exxon Mobil was $55 on June 8 and last Friday it was $54. **COP** Conoco Phillips was $51 on June 8 and last Friday it was $52. **OXY** Occidental Petroleum was $24 on June 8 and last Friday it was $26.

And so... WTH is going on? **Weird stuff afoot**. 

Can someone explain to this retard why New York bankers want to fabricate a stock market plunge just as the economy is rolling onward?And explain why me and my fellow autists should sell oil and gas stocks that have gone nowhere when crude oil is up 50%?"

484,Fun and Games Switching From Margin to Cash on ET,2021-02-28 05:19:59,"I called my trading platform (not RH) tonight and talked to a CS rep re: having my account taken off of margin trading. She told me that it would be a 2 hour wait b/c only a broker could do it. I told her that I had absolutely nothing better to do, since my wife's boyfriend was over tonight. In less than 10 seconds from being transferred, got a broker who took 10 minutes of reviewing my account before telling me he could have it done by Monday.  ( I guess the 2 hour remark was to get me to pass on following through with my request tonight. ) He told me he would try to make it as painless as possible and I told him I wasn't aware that there should be any pain in this process. (Awkward silence from his side then he laughed and stated that it was a poor choice of words...I'm thinking maybe a projection on his part). When asked for confirmation that process was completed, he told me he would call me personally and let me know it was done. I read several articles suggesting this as a great way to anti-short my stonks.  I do think this is the way...See you apes on the moon!"

488,I shopped at GameStop today and it blew my mind.,2021-02-27 03:01:51,"I went into a GameStop with my girlfriend so she could buy her normal little Pokemon Knick knacks and t-shirts.... BUT.... My visit made me rethink that GameStop really is doing better than I thought.

First of all, this location had about 15 customers in there not including us. Two people bought switches, and three bought memberships before it got to our turn in line.

But seriously, I'm here to talk about the membership and how I could see it was causing serious loyalty. I haven't paid attention to their membership in a while, so I was surprised to see that about 10 of the 15 people that were checked out before me said they wanted to use their membership coupon, or wanted to sign up for the membership.

When it came to be my turn in line, I had to ask. What's the membership do.

It's 15 a year, and you get a 5 dollar discount coupon every month, including one that you could use right away that printed on the receipt. I shit you not, that all three people before me, and then me, went a took that instant 5 dollar coupon to go buy something else right away, leading me to actually spend $20 more than I intended on during my visit.

I felt like I was getting a deal, but I also worked retail for years and know they probably more than made that 5 dollars back.

But the thing that makes me the most hopeful, was the amount of customers that told the cashier they would see them next month.

Granted, I live in a decently large city... But it really made it seem like they were not only keeping busy, but their membership program change is working.

I commented to the guy I thought the membership was only for games, and he said thankfully they had changed it for pretty much all the products in the store - realistically why I actually stop in the too look around even if I have games, to get my nerdy stuff.

TLDR: felt like the new membership program was 🔥, bought more than I expected, and saw what looked like a lot of customer loyalty.

Edit:: Spelling from mobile, and to mention I do not currently have any shares as stated in one of the top comments. I do plan on picking shares up again. These are my current positions because I'm a newb poor boy. https://imgur.com/PFGNbeF"
