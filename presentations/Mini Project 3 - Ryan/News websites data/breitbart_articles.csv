1,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights. (This matches conservatives' view that transgenderism also attacks heterosexuality & health). So what is more important for progressives?

2,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
3,"The leaders of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) have united in a joint condemnation of the taxpayer-funded abortion included in the Democrats’ American Rescue Plan.In their statement, the president of the USCCB, Los Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez, together with the chairmen of seven USCCB committees, noted that the legislation abandons “a longstanding bipartisan compromise that respects the consciences of millions of Americans.”“For 45 years, the United States Congress – whether controlled by Democrats or Republicans – has maintained that taxpayers should not be forced against their conscience to pay for abortions,” the bishops asserted.“Abandoning this compromise in a time of national emergency only serves to divide people in the very moment we should be united,” they added. “Please, let us instead focus on delivering the COVID relief so desperately needed.”In their statement, the bishops observed that rather than healing and uniting Americans, the legislation would drive a wedge between them.“We urge President Biden and the leadership on Capitol Hill not to force upon Americans the wrenching moral decision whether to preserve the lives and health of the born or unborn, all of whom are our vulnerable neighbors in need,” they appealed.“We ask that our leaders please not pit people against one another in such a way,” the bishops write, while asking all Members of Congress to “include the same protections against abortion funding that have been present in every COVID relief bill to date, and every annual spending bill for almost half a century.”Joining Gomez in the statement were New York Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, chairman of the Committee for Religious Liberty; Kansas City Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann, chairman of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities; Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul S.

4,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980. After his speech, the Republican nominee won a standing ovation and the endorsement of the 35,000-member union. (AP Photo/Charles W. Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
5,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

That money won’t be held up.

9,"San Diego’s plan to turn sewage into drinking water using so-called “toilet-to-tap” technology has cleared the last regulatory hurdles and could begin operation by 2025.The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Saturday:San Diego is ready to start building the long-awaited Pure Water sewage recycling system, now that city officials have resolved litigation that delayed the project 18 months and increased its estimated cost to $5 billion, city officials say.Pure Water will boost San Diego’s water independence by recycling 83 million gallons of treated sewage into potable drinking water by 2035.All regulatory permits have been secured and construction bids are being opened and analyzed for the 10 projects that will make up Pure Water phase one, a large treatment facility slated to open in 2025 near Miramar that will be connected to many miles of pipeline in the northern part of the city.As Breitbart News reported two years ago, many local authorities are considering projects that could increase water supplies through desalination or through treating wastewater:As for water storage, the prospect of new plans — such as raising the height of the Shasta Dam — seemed to dim with the new Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. New “progressives,” led by first-year Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), supported a “Green New Deal” that sought to move the entire U.S. economy to 100% renewable energy sources by 2030 — but”renewables” pointedly excluded hydroelectric power from dams, which use water to generate electricity but do not consume it, leaving it available for other uses.That leaves two options for dealing with chronic water scarcity in California: conservation, and “creation.” The state’s residents could learn to live with radical reductions in water use, such as those contemplated by a new, non-binding state targetfor indoor water usage of 55 gallons per person per day, announced in 2018.Alternatively — or, in addition — the state could also use new technologies to convert sea water, filtered sewage effluent, agricultural runoff, or other non-potable sources of water into potable water.Given that droughts tend to recur — and predictions by climate change activists that droughts will be even more frequent in the future — it might seem that desalination and other methods of creating fresh water would provide a solution.Both desalination and “toilet-to-tap” utilize new developments in reverse osmosis technology, which extracts pure water from seawater or sewage.However, as this reporter noted in 2019, wastewater purification “is less expensive and less energy-intensive than desalination.”Public enthusiasm for new water projects has waned in recent years, as memories of California’s 2011-2017 drought have faded. But after the first relatively dry winter in years, Californians may once again show interest in unconventional solutions.Joel B.

10,"A school in Lubbock,Texas, held a “Rules of Chivalry Day” to compare and contrast how men and women court or date in Medieval compared to modern times, but a report in the Dallas Morning News about the assignment slammed it for telling girls to be subservient and feminine to please the boys.The document, which only included instructions for the “ladies” and not for the “men,” said:The assignment also said the ladies should provide the men in the classroom with refreshments.Here’s a really … interesting … assignment on chivalry from @shallowaterisd. They are requiring the female students to lower their heads and curtsy for men; clean up after men; cook for and bring a drink to the men’s class.

The ladies in the class will follow the Rules of Chivalry Day. All ladies deemed worth of the honor by the gentlemen receive 10 points for every signature at the end of the day. The New York Post reported on the criticism that led to the lesson being nixed:Male students were also reportedly given advisories — including referring to girls as “milady” and showing “courtly courtesy as they assist ladies who may have dropped an article by picking it up for them,” according to a subsequent tweet.Boys were also told not to use vulgarity or complain and to rise when females entered or exited a room.Twitter reactions varied — with some speculating that the assignments were supposed to demonstrate regressive gender roles of the period. But most respondents found the material unacceptable no matter the intent. The school eventually canceled the concept outright.“This assignment has been reviewed, and despite its historical context, it does not reflect our district and community values,” Dr. Anita Herbert, superintendent of the local district told Fox News. “The matter has been addressed with the teacher, and the assignment was removed.”Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comEducationPoliticschivalrycourtingDatinggentlemenladiesMedievalschool curriculumTexas.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
11,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) held open a vote on a minimum wage amendment Friday to buy time to save the $1.9 trillion coronavirus package after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) raised an unforeseen objection.The objection caused the longest vote in history, 11 hours and 50 minutes. The vote was finally closed at 10:53 p.m.With the help of President Biden, it took Schumer nearly nine hours to negotiate a deal with Manchin. Under the deal, laid-off workers will receive $300-a-week federal unemployment benefits on top of their state benefits until September 6, 2021. And the first $10,200 in unemployment benefits received in 2020 will be tax-free for households with less than $150,000 in annual income.After the deal was struck, the Senate had to wait for the legislative text to be drafted and for a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.The vote broke the record set on June 28, 2019, when senators kept a vote on an amendment to the annual defense authorization bill open for ten hours and eight minutes to accommodate Democrat presidential candidates who participated in a debate in Miami.The delay caused Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to point out, “If we were doing this [delay], you’d be all over us. We couldn’t get five feet down the hall.”“Why did you put the Senate on hold for five-and-a-half hours because you won’t let two Republicans work with a Democrat to do something they want to do,” he said of the Democrats’ effort to freeze votes to persuade Manchin not to support a proposed Republican amendment that renegotiated the amount of weekly unemployment benefits in the package from $400 to $300 and to extend those benefits to July 18 instead of August 29, as passed by the House.“They’ve been working their members over since 11 o’clock,” said Senate Republican Whip John Thune (R-SD). “They had an alternative amendment they’ve trying to whip and they’ve had problems trying to get votes for that.”According to the Hill, “All the while Schumer, Biden, Wyden and Carper were working feverishly behind the scenes to hammer out a deal with Manchin.”PoliticsChuck SchumercoronavirusJoe ManchinJohn ThuneLindsey Graham.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
12,"Democrats voted against his amendment to the proposed coronavirus relief package that would have stopped American taxpayers’ money from going to illegal aliens in $1,400 stimulus checks, Sen.

Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall.

13,"GOP senators, who voted against the Democrat-led Senate’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure on Saturday, sharply criticized the partisan measure upon its passing, emphasizing that it is filled with a “host of non-COVID-related left-wing policies.”The Senate passed the measure 50-49 on Saturday along party lines. Republican Rep. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) was not present for the vote as he had to travel home for a family emergency.While Senate Democrats celebrated the measure’s passage — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) described it as “the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of this country” — Republicans warned that the bill contains a trove of left-wing pursuits unrelated to the Chinese coronavirus. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) highlighted similar concerns last week, noting that less than nine percent of the House bill went toward measures related to public health.“I voted against this bill today because it could further wreck the economy and ignite inflation.  This legislation includes a host of non-COVID-related left-wing policies,” Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) said in a statement, noting that “nine percent of the funding in the bill goes toward the immediate fight against COVID and one percent toward vaccines.”The bill, he added, includes what he described as a “massive cash bailout for some mismanaged states and local governments.”“Democrats are forcing a liberal wish list of pet projects through Congress that’s masked as a pandemic rescue package,” he added.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also highlighted the bill’s shortfalls and, like his Republican colleagues, explained that just nine percent of the measure goes toward measures related to the pandemic.“Instead of working in a bipartisan manner to open our schools, bring back small businesses, and help struggling Americans get back on their feet, Democrats chose to pander to their radical liberal base with partisan handouts,” the Texas senator said in a statement.“This bill is stuffed with pork, with only nine percent of the almost $2 trillion going toward actual and urgent COVID relief,” he continued, emphasizing that the Democrat measure “shockingly provides COVID relief checks to illegal aliens and criminals behind bars.”“I proposed two amendments to close these loopholes. Democrats voted in lockstep to ensure illegal aliens and prison inmates would still qualify for these rebates,” he said.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) also noted that Democrats voted to hand stimulus checks to criminals in prison.“They haven’t lost their jobs, they aren’t worried about paying rent or buying groceries. Another example of the unrelated spending in the Democrats’ partisan slush fund,” he remarked.Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said Democrats effectively “took advantage” of the pandemic and poisoned the relief bill with unrelated spending measures that they have been in pursuit of for years.“Many of my Democratic colleagues refer to this as a recovery package, but unlike the previous five COVID relief bills, this bill risks actually preventing our economy from recovering, which it is already showing signs of doing,” she said in a statement.“This partisan bill attempts to fix problems that don’t exist, hamstring growth that has already begun, rewards bad decisions by elected officials, and opens the floodgates for unchartered levels of federal spending,” Capito added.Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) described the bill as a “behemoth” stuffed with programs that “have nothing to do with the targeted, temporary relief the people of Wyoming need to weather the rest of this pandemic” and blasted Democrats for taking a partisan approach in this relief measure.The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) released a statement following the bill’s passage, providing a list of some of the unrelated items embraced by Democrats in the “spending spree” bill. The NRSC’s list included:“It’s clear.

14,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
15,"Democrat congressman from California Ro Khanna (D-CA) disagrees with President Biden’s approach to the Middle East.Khanna told Axios the Biden Middle East plans are “conceding defeat of the aspiration” to win a Nobel Peace Prize.“Obama strove for greatness,” Khanna told the news outlet when speaking about the past Obama administration’s foreign policy plan. “He, at least, tried.”Khanna backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president, who in the past has called Israel “right-wing and racist.” Sanders has also opposed the war in Iran saying, “I don’t apologize to anybody,” on opposing the war.Previously, Khanna also worked with Sen.

Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

17,"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) claimed a win Friday after forcing Democrats to remove from their COVID “liberal wish list” bill a provision that would have allowed every Planned Parenthood facility in the country to receive free taxpayer funds through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).“Democrats knew this was never about COVID relief or helping small businesses,” said Dr. Paul, an ophthalmologist. “It was a shameless attempt to fund their radical agenda on the taxpayers’ backs and I was successful in preventing that from happening by stopping these funds from going to abortion mills.”Dems knew this wasn’t about COVID relief/helping small businesses.

Read more: https://t.co/K37N8cIYl5— Senator Rand Paul (@RandPaul) March 5, 2021In a press statement, Paul’s office explained in the House version of the “massive $1.9 trillion liberal wish list,” individual Planned Parenthood facilities would have been treated as separate entities and, as such, eligible for the federal PPP aid.Paul’s office explained further:The original congressional intent of PPP was to limit large and well-financed groups, such as Planned Parenthood from receiving a loan, and instead provide relief to small business affected by COVID-19. Democrats had planned to waive affiliation rules for nonprofits to provide paycheck protection loans to Planned Parenthood in the House version of the COVID-19 relief package. The Paul team strenuously argued to the Senate Parliamentarian that this waiver would only benefit Planned Parenthood and thus violated the so-called Byrd rule. Before the Parliamentarian was able to rule on the arguments presented, the Democrats filed an updated version of the bill that did not include the offending provision – a concession that avoided setting a precedent.Thank you, Senator @RandPaul , for preventing the money that was intended to serve as COVID relief for small businesses through the Payment Protection Program Program from going to Planned Parenthood. https://t.co/KW08s5rfrn— CWA LAC (@CWforA) March 6, 2021Thank you @RandPaul for protecting the millions of Americans who oppose taxpayer-funded abortion, as well as protecting millions of Americans still in the womb from the violence of abortion. https://t.co/Xb7MTroQnV— March for Life (@March_for_Life) March 5, 2021In May 2020, Planned Parenthood affiliates received $80 million in loans from the PPP in violation of the rules of the relief program.

18,"President Joe Biden is the first executive in 40 years to come to this point in his term without holding a formal question and answer session, such as a news conference or Oval Office address.“It reflects a White House media strategy meant both to reserve major media set-pieces for the celebration of a legislative victory and to limit unforced errors from a historically gaffe-prone politician,” the Associated Press (AP) reported Saturday.The president chooses to take questions nearly as often as many of his recent predecessors, but usually takes one or two informal inquiries in a hurried setting toward the end of events, the article continued:In a sharp contrast with the previous administration, the White House is exerting extreme message discipline, empowering staff to speak but doing so with caution. Recalling both Biden’s largely leak-free campaign and the buttoned-up Obama administration, the new White House team has carefully managed the president’s appearances, trying to lower the temperature from Donald Trump’s Washington and to save a big media moment to mark what could soon be a signature accomplishment: passage of the COVID-19 bill.On Wednesday, CNN’s Jake Tapper tweeted, “An analysis of the past 100 years shows President Biden’s 15 most recent predecessors all held a formal solo press conference within 33 days of taking office.

19,"More than 3,300 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) and youth arriving with adults at the United States-Mexico border are in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody as officials anticipate a 20-year surge of illegal immigration.Data reviewed by Breitbart News on Friday showed more than 3,300 migrant youth in DHS custody, about 71 percent of which are UACs who will be released to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for eventual release and resettlement in the U.S.The other roughly 30 percent in DHS custody as of March 5 were youth who arrived with border crossing adults. The data found that about 1,315 migrant youth, alone, were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday.Of all migrant youth currently in DHS custody, almost all of whom will be released into the U.S., more than 53 percent are boys between the ages of 13 and 17-years-old.The data comes as internal communications between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials reveal that President Joe Biden’s administration is anticipating a 20-year illegal immigration high of UACs and adult border crossers arriving with children. DHS is planning to welcome roughly 117,000 UACs into the U.S. this year, a 290 percent increase from 2020 totals.The Washington Post reported:On Thursday, Russell Hott, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), notified staff of the rapid-processing plan in an email that said arrivals by unaccompanied minors and families this year “are expected to be the highest numbers observed in over 20 years.” [Emphasis added]The report, in addition, stated that DHS officials are looking to transform the southern border into a rapid-processing site where foreign nationals can arrive and expect to be quickly released into the U.S. interior.A source who spoke to Breitbart News anonymously confirmed that top officials at DHS are seeking to turn the border into a welcoming center with “Ellis Island-style rapid-processing hubs,” as the Post originally reported.As Breitbart News reported, the UAC pipeline to the U.S. has increased by nearly 600 percent since President Trump was in office — before Biden ended the Remain in Mexico program and canceled cooperative asylum agreements with Central America.More than 87 percent of UACs in HHS custody are between 13 and 17-years-old, while more than 71 percent are boys. The most common destinations for UACs are in Harris County, Texas; Dallas County, Texas; Davidson County, Tennessee; Queens County, New York; Suffolk County, New York; Kings County, New York; Prince George’s County, Maryland; Palm Beach County, Florida; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Los Angeles County, California.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

20,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

21,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
22,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi.

(PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980. After his speech, the Republican nominee won a standing ovation and the endorsement of the 35,000-member union. (AP Photo/Charles W. Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
23,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Sierra Club, surrounds the Sierra Club filing a FOIA request for “draft biological opinions” in 2013. The opinions focused on threats to endangered species from power plant operations.“Because the decision makers neither approved the drafts nor sent them to the EPA, they are best described not as draft biological opinions but as drafts of draft biological opinions,” Barrett wrote. “While the drafts may have had the practical effect of provoking EPA to revise its rule, the privilege applies because the Services did not treat the drafts as final.The remaining conservative judges joined Barrett’s opinion, as did liberal Justice Elena Kagan. Liberal Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.In his dissent, Breyer wrote it is reasonable to believe that “draft” opinions were documents that played a role in deciding whether the EPA proceeds with a rule.The High Court remanded the case to the lower court to see if any part of these documents can be segregated from the deliberative part, and thus disclosable under FOIA.

The school eventually canceled the concept outright.“This assignment has been reviewed, and despite its historical context, it does not reflect our district and community values,” Dr. Anita Herbert, superintendent of the local district told Fox News. “The matter has been addressed with the teacher, and the assignment was removed.”Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comEducationPoliticschivalrycourtingDatinggentlemenladiesMedievalschool curriculumTexas.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
30,"Democrats voted against his amendment to the proposed coronavirus relief package that would have stopped American taxpayers’ money from going to illegal aliens in $1,400 stimulus checks, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Saturday.Sen. Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall. As a result, more Americans would be cut off from payments,” the article concluded.ImmigrationPoliticsPre-ViralcoronavirusIllegal Aliensstimulus checksTed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
31,"CNN’s website ignored for 12 hours the revelation that Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) administration covered up nursing home deaths.CNN’s homepage went more than 12 hours without covering the Wall Street Journal report that Cuomo’s top advisers influenced New York state health officials to remove data from a public report showing nursing home deaths relating to Coronavirus in the state.Breitbart News provided coverage on the article previously:According to the Wall Street Journal, the governor’s advisers stripped the number of nursing home residents who died after they were transferred to a hospital from the report, making the death toll look better for Cuomo.The doctored report, released in July, allowed Cuomo to continue trumpeting his success in fighting the virus in New York.“Whatever happens, this is going to be a period to learn from,” Cuomo said in a radio interview on July 10, just after the doctored information was released. “I am now thinking about writing a book about what we went through, lessons learned, the entire experience, because if we don’t learn from this, then it will really compound the whole crisis that we’ve gone through.”The governor’s brother, Chris Cuomo, is currently employed by the cable news network. According to Fox News, “CNN covered the report Friday morning on air but avoided it online through 11 a.m. ET on Friday, more than 12 hours after the Journal reported the latest development in the nursing home scandal.:On Tuesday night, Chris Cuomo made a statement about this brother at the beginning of his show, Cuomo Prime Time:“Before we start tonight, let me say something that I am sure is very obvious to you who watch my show …”  Cuomo said at the start of CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time. “Obviously, I am aware of what is going on with my brother. And obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother.”In an April 2020 column from the New York Times, the paper reported that CNN executives banned Chris Cuomo from reporting on his brother in 2013.According to Fox News “CNN’s verified Twitter account had not mentioned the report after 12 hours either. A report was then posted on Twitter at 2:00 p.m. ET on Friday.”A report by Fox News said:A new article about Cuomo’s nursing home scandal appeared on the CNN homepage Friday afternoon, but not as a top story. The lack of online coverage of the embattled governor was also noticed Thursday morning by Tom Bevan of RealClearPolitics, as Cuomo faced a litany of accusations from former female staffers of inappropriate advances and harassment.Friday afternoon, CNN’s homepage showed a reaction to a Tucker Carlson show, Beto O’Rouke, and “QAnon-related graffiti.”CNN’s homepage now has a reaction to a recent Tucker Carlson show, an article about Beto O’Rourke maybe perhaps running for elected office, and a big call-out for “QAnon-related graffiti” and…zero mentions of embattled Governor Andrew Cuomo. pic.twitter.com/L28THmbDra— Drew Holden (@DrewHolden360) March 5, 2021Friday morning, CNN’s homepage mentioned “Trump” 10 times, while only mentioning Cuomo’s name once at the top under the “live updates” section.CNN has “Trump” mentioned 10 times on their home page right now.“Cuomo” is mentioned once.

32,"Illinois billionaire Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) has desperately tried to make himself the central Democrat powerbroker in a state controlled by the party, but each month, his stock seems to sink lower despite the millions he is spreading around.Pritzker has suffered one defeat after another and seems to be steadily fading into irrelevancy in a state entirely controlled by the party he was presumably elected to lead, MSN News noted.The Democrat governor’s most public loss was the defeat of his massive income tax hike on which he spent $56 million for a misleading campaign to convince voters to approve.But the governor has lost time and again in power plays with his party, too, as reporter Mark Konkol points out.For instance, he lost a bid to get his handpicked candidate elected as Senate president by his fellow Democrats. Pritzker wanted Sen. Kimberly Lightford — a big Pritzker supporter — to become the upper chamber’s chief, but his party gave the nod to Democrat Dan Harmon instead.Pritzker also mistakenly thought he had another track to grow his influence.In February, longtime House Speaker and Democrat Party chief Michael Madigan “retired” just ahead of a growing investigation into political corruption that had been edging ever closer to him. Madigan has had a chokehold on Illinois Demsocrats for more than four decades, and Pritzker saw his departure as a chance to take hold of the party for himself.Consequently, Pritzker made a play to get Chicago Ald. Michelle Harris to replace the recently resigned Madigan as party chief. Unfortunately for the governor, the party went in a different direction by handing the keys to the party to U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, who became the state’s first black female Democratic Party chairwoman.Pritzker has come up dry in other areas, too. For instance, he lost his attempt to force Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle to follow his ideas on distributing the coronavirus vaccine in their jurisdictions.Pritzker dove into the influence game with gusto by donating ten million dollars of his own money to many of Madigan’s allies. He also jumped to put one Madigan suggestion after another into positions of power, likely assuming he was buying himself some consideration.So far, though, all his money, favors, and positioning seem to have afforded him little favor among the Democrat establishment.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.PoliticsIllinoisJ.B.

33,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki responded at a press briefing Friday to a request from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to meet about the crisis on the Southern border.Psaki said Biden is currently focused on rolling back former President Trump’s policies on border security and immigration.“Well, first, the president and this administration’s focus is on digging out of the dismantled and inhumane immigration approach of the last administration,” she said during the afternoon briefing.Biden’s new approach has triggered a flood of migrants at the southern border. Border agents detained nearly 100,000 migrants in February, up from 78,000 in January with more expected in the upcoming months.McCarthy wrote a letter to Biden Friday requesting a meeting to discuss the border crisis.“I feel compelled to express great concern with the manner in which your administration is approaching this crisis, but with hope that we can work together to solve it,” McCarthy wrote in the letter.When asked about McCarthy’s letter, Psaki referred reporters to Biden’s proposed immigration bill, which would offer amnesty to the more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.Psaki said:[T]he president has proposed an immigration bill that would not only address the root causes that [House Minority] Leader McCarthy referenced in his letter, but would move beyond the policy of funding ineffective border walls by investing in smart security at ports of entry and would also create a pathway to citizenship.Any discussion with Biden on immigration, Psaki said, should begin with a path forward to pass his proposed amnesty bill.“We would welcome the openness or desire to engage on that from the leader or any Democrat or Republican who wants to have a conversation about a constructive path forward,” she said.ImmigrationPoliticsJen PsakiJoe BidenKevin McCarthy.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
34,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
35,"President Joe Biden has been criticized by members of his own advisory board for the push to vaccinate teachers and reopen schools five days a week within his first 100 days in office.In February, Biden said his 100-day goal was to have most elementary schools open five days a week, seeming to conflict with his own press secretary, who had said last week that schools would be considered “open” if they held in-person classes even one day a week.A report from the Hill said the plan “uses the administration’s partnership with pharmacies to prioritize giving educators at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine this month.” Biden added, “educators should be treated like essential employees.”On Tuesday, Dr. Celine Gounder, a member of the Biden coronavirus advisory board, said, “It doesn’t make any sense,” referring to the Biden administration wanting to prioritize educators, as part of an effort to reopen schools. Gounder added that high rick teachers would be vaccinated as part of other groups like “over 65 years old” or “chronic medical conditions.”1/ I am really surprised. This doesn’t make any sense. High-risk teachers (i.e. over 65 and/or with chronic medical conditions) would be vaccinated as part of those groups. Young, healthy teachers don’t need to be prioritized. Schools are among the safest in-person workplaces. https://t.co/DOwlqfMieX— Céline Gounder, MD, ScM, FIDSA (@celinegounder) March 2, 2021“Retail pharmacies told to prioritize vaccinating teachers but not getting extra supply. This means taking vaccine away from higher-risk persons & communities of color to vaccine young healthy teachers. This is an ANTI-EQUITY move,” Gounder tweeted.On Tuesday, White House senior adviser on coronavirus response Andy Slavitt was asked by Wolf Blitzer if Biden’s announcement to give every educator and childcare worker at least one shot by the end of this month would move up the time to having kids back in school full time. Slavitt responded:Well, his goal is to get kids back to school safely, as early as possible, and permanently. And the CDC has helped a great deal with guidelines that help schools figure out what it takes to open. And while the CDC has said teachers aren’t required to be vaccinated for the schools to open in-person, the president made the decision that we can use this new capability we have.On Wednesday, Senior Adviser and Chief Spokesperson to Vice President Kamala Harris Symone Sanders joined Joy Reid on MSNBC’s The ReidOut. Sanders stated that both Biden and Harris “believe that teachers should be prioritized in states to get the vaccines, just like frontline workers, and they also agree with the CDC guidance, that that is not a requirement for schools to get open.”EducationHealthPoliticsAndy SlavittCDCCeline GoundercoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineJoe BidenJoy ReidKamala HarrisSymone SandersWolf Blitzer.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
36,"President Joe Biden is expanding his breakdown of interior immigration enforcement, dubbed “sanctuary country” orders, by giving illegal aliens another avenue to avoid arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.On Friday, ICE officials told Congress that the agency would open an “ICE Case Review” process in which illegal aliens can challenge their arrest and detainment.Already, Biden has implemented sanctuary country orders whereby about nine-in-ten illegal aliens, who would typically be arrested by ICE and deported, now face no threat of arrest and deportation until they are convicted of an aggravated felony or found to be a national security threat.The review process will mean that illegal aliens can challenge their arrest and detainment if they believe they do not meet the convicted aggravated felon, terrorist, gang member, or national security threat standards.As a result, the limited number of illegal aliens arrested and detained by ICE will now be able to contest their arrests through this additional route.“It’s as if the Biden people are more intent on reversing every single immigration enforcement action that the Trump administration took, no matter how appropriate or routine, and no matter the cost to taxpayers nor how illogical to reverse it,” the Center for Immigration Studies’ Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan told Breitbart News.“It’s an insult to legal immigrants,” Vaughan said.As Breitbart News reported, Biden’s sanctuary country orders are helping arrested illegal aliens avoid arrest and deportation by ICE. Instead, local law enforcement officials are having to release illegal aliens arrested for crimes back into their communities.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

37,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

39,"San Francisco is dealing with its homeless epidemic by spending $16.1 million for 262 tents  — an investment that breaks down to $190 a night or $61,000 per tent per year. The tents will be placed in empty lots around the city, creating what officials are calling “safe sleeping villages.” The city will also provide food and other services.“The annual cost of one spot in one site is 2½ times the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco,” the San Francisco Chronicle reported.The report continued:City leaders are under enormous pressure to address the city’s swelling homeless population, which has become more worrisome and visible amid the pandemic as traditional shelters have had to cut their capacity and other services have been disrupted. But several officials said Wednesday that the tent program — which is not eligible for federal reimbursement — is staggeringly expensive and must be re-examined, especially amid the $650 million budget deficit that San Francisco projects over the next two years.The $16.1 million allocated for the safe sleeping program in the current budget is a fraction of the more than $300 million spent annually on homeless services. A 2018 ballot measure will probably raise an additional $250 million to $300 million per year. Abigail Stewart-Kahn is interim director of the city’s homeless department.Stewart-Kahn noted that the city had to scramble to create other options for the homeless as indoor shelters were closing early in the pandemic. She said officials did not have time to do a more thorough contract bidding process, which may have lowered operating costs. The sites are also on empty lots around the city — including outside of City Hall and at a City College parking lot South of Market — which required water and electrical hookups, along with around-the-clock security.“It’s eye-popping, and we need to understand why that is,” San Francisco Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, who proposed legislation last fall to create more shelter options like safe sleeping villages, said. “We have to find a way to have exits from the streets. But we need them to be more cost-effective than the safe sleeping program that the city has been running.”Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the city’s Coalition on Homelessness, said the tents are a good option during the coronavirus pandemic because they help prevent spread and provide more privacy than a cot in a shelter.“But we do not think that a tent is a permanent solution to homelessness,” Friedenbach said in the Chronicle report.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comEconomyHealthPoliticshomelessnessSan Franciscosleeping villagestent city.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
40,"President Joe Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released at least more than 800 border crossers into the United States in the last four days, data reviewed by Breitbart News reveals.In the first four days of March, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency released about 814 border crossers into the U.S. interior — an average of about 204 releases every day this month — according to the data.The bulk of those released are going to Brownsville, Texas; Yuma, Arizona; and Kingsville, Texas.The releases are only a portion of the total border crossers being released, as the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency also releases border crossers on a daily basis into the U.S. interior. ICE officials have not provided Breitbart News with an updated total of releases for the month of February and the first week of March.In February, the data showed that CBP released more than 1,900 border crossers into the U.S., which amounts to a daily average of about 69 releases every day for that month. In comparison, the totals show massive influxes compared to when President Trump was in office — before Biden ended the Remain in Mexico program and canceled cooperative asylum agreements with Central America.In November 2020, for example, CBP released just eight border crossers into the U.S. interior. Similarly, in December 2020, just 19 border crossers were released by the agency. This means there has been a nearly 24,000 percent increase in releases from November 2020 to February 2021.None of the border crossers released, except for those enrolled in the Remain in Mexico program, are required to test negative for the Chinese coronavirus.Reports this week confirmed that border crossers are testing positive for the coronavirus after their release and still are not required to quarantine. In one case, a Honduran national who tested positive continued traveling to North Carolina.The data is a reflection of the Biden administration’s widespread Catch and Release policy in which border crossers arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border can claim asylum, be quickly processed, and then be released into the nation’s interior with only a promise to appear at their court hearings at a later date.In addition to Biden’s Catch and Release expansion, the administration is looking to transform the southern border into a welcoming and processing site for arrivals. Rather than seeking to control the inflow of border crossers, DHS wants to rebrand the process by managing the inflow, to include “Ellis Island-style rapid-processing hubs,” according to reports.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Could it maybe be the supporters of Governor Noem?” Miller asked, before clarifying that he was not attempting to “take anything away” from the South Dakota governor, who has seen her political star rise for taking an anti-lockdown approach during the coronavirus pandemic.“I can tell you, as someone who probably speaks with him on the political side as much, if not more than anybody else, never once has there been a conversation internally or in a group about doing something different for the VP position for 2024 if he decides to go that route,” Miller added. “President Trump and Vice President Pence have had a couple of really good conversations since President Trump left office.”Trump and Pence without speaking for a brief period after the former president demanded that the former vice president act against certifying the 2020 election during Congress’s election certification process.Ahead of the certification, Pence revealed in a letter that he did not believe he had Constitutional authority to overturn the electoral votes.Days following the January 6th Capitol Hill riot, Trump and Pence met Monday to discuss attack and various key issues, administration sources told Breitbart News.“I realize that some Trump supporters might be a little bit frustrated with the former vice president,” said Miller. “He’s a great guy.

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

43,"Former Green Beret and Gold Star husband Joe Kent told Breitbart News there is a sharp divide between America First principles and the actions of the Joe Biden administration.Kent is challenging incumbent U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA) in a primary after Beutler joined 9 other Republicans and the Democrats in impeaching former President Donald Trump in January.Kent said after nearly two decades of “almost continuous combat” and the loss of his wife, Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent, to a suicide bomber while she was deployed in 2019 to Syria fighting ISIS, President Trump appealed to him because Trump contrasted the “rhetoric of both parties on why we needed to stay deeply involved in the Middle East and in these wars that never seem to benefit us.”He argued the U.S. was involved in wars because “our elected leaders had too much hubris to say that they had gotten it wrong and they continued to double and triple down” on failure.“President Trump’s foreign policy ties directly into his domestic policy getting us to a point where we are energy independent here makes it so that we don’t need to be involved in these endless wars in the Middle East,” Kent said.“Everything that President Trump did was putting the American people first,” he said.He told Breitbart News that President Joe Biden’s strategy is “completely different” from Trump’s strategy.“President Trump was using the full scope of American power, so President Trump was using military strikes only when necessary,” Kent said, citing the drone attack against Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.“He didn’t escalated any further and he took efforts to get us out of Iraq while using diplomacy against the Iraqi government,” he argued.Kent also complimented Trump’s strategy of pulling countries together with Israel in the Abraham Accords to isolate Iran.“Joe Biden and the neocons, the neoliberals, they have a much different vision. They believe that we can use consistent military force as a means of diplomacy and that we need to be deeply invested in the stability and the affairs of the Middle East,” he said.“Joe Biden and his ilk in the neocons, the neoliberals, they haven’t found a country yet they don’t want to give trillions of dollars to or invade,” Kent said.Kent said voters in Washington’s Third Congressional District are “furious” over Beutler’s vote to impeach Trump.“This district benefited greatly from President Trump’s America First policies and overwhelmingly supported President Trump in 2016 and again in 2020,” he said.Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

44,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
45,"Former President Donald Trump issued a statement Friday challenging President Joe Biden for opening up the Southern border to a wave of migrants.“Our border is now totally out of control thanks to the disastrous leadership of Joe Biden,” Trump wrote in a statement sent to reporters.The former president sounded the alarm over the renewed surge of migrants headed for the border after the Biden administration sent a signal that unaccompanied migrants would be welcomed into the United States.The Department of Homeland Security predicts there will be 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants crossing the border in 2021, according to an Axios report.“A mass incursion into the country by people who should not be here is happening on an hourly basis, getting worse by the minute,” he said.The number of migrant youth daily referred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for release into the United States has surged nearly 600 percent since President Trump was in office, according to newly released data, and federal shelters are at an estimated 93 percent of capacity.Trump said that many migrants being allowed into the United States and illegal immigrants who are no longer being deported under Biden had criminal records or were infected with and spreading the coronavirus.“The spiraling tsunami at the border is overwhelming local communities, depleting budgets, crowding hospitals, and taking jobs from legal American workers,” Trump wrote.Biden has denied there is a crisis on the border, signaling confidence that his administration can handle the challenge.But Trump recalled that he had achieved “the most secure border in our country’s history” during his presidency and condemned Biden’s recent actions that allowed the crisis to flare up.“Under Biden, it will soon be worse, more dangerous, and more out of control than ever before,” Trump wrote. “He has violated his oath of office to uphold our Constitution and enforce our laws.”Trump recalled his successful Remain in Mexico Policy for migrants claiming asylum as well as the Safe Third Agreements in Central America, and he berated Biden rolling them back and restoring catch-and-release policies.“We put in place powerful rules and procedures to stop the smuggling and trafficking, but the Biden Administration has abandoned these proven strategies and instead given the smugglers and traffickers effective control of our border,” he wrote.HealthImmigrationPoliticscatch and releaseCentral AmericaDepartment of Homeland SecurityDonald TrumpJoe BidenRemain in Mexico.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
46,"Dauphin, Pennsylvania, community members surprised the town’s one UPS driver with a celebration, and a gift, on Tuesday.Fewer than 800 people call Dauphin their home. Sitting on the bank of the Susquehanna River, the hamlet cannot even claim a single traffic light. But, like many small communities, Dauphin residents are especially close-knit. After a year of 60-80 hour weeks struggling to provide vital supplies to his town, UPS deliver man Chad Turns discovered just how much he means to his neighbors.“Everyone knows how special Chad is,” resident Jenny Shickley told NBC’s TODAY. “If he thinks something might be a gift – and this happened to us – he literally didn’t deliver it when the kids were in the yard, he just drove by, and then he drove all the way back to our house after dark, because he was nervous it was a gift and didn’t want to ruin it for the kids.”But this account of Turns’ persistent goodwill is just one of many. “On Facebook, another friend mentioned there was a package that needed signing and they weren’t home,” Shickley continued. “Chad was nervous that it was important, so he went to their parents’ house to get it signed for them.”Townspeople frequently leave water, cookies, or other bits of encouragement for Turns as he travels to each home, but it was Shickley who decided to take the town’s gratitude to Facebook. She sought out other Dauphin residents to help raise funds for a proper show of the town’s gratitude. Dauphin answered the call, and more. “The funny thing is I meant to set it up for $300, but it set to $500,” she said. “It hit $500 within two days and the total wound up being a little over $1000.”Local UPS shift supervisor Adam Kerr helped Shickley with the surprise, ensuring Turns’ last delivery was an “on-demand pickup” at the town’s municipal building. “Chad thought he was going to pick up a box, [but] it was the community and kids and big signs,” Shickley explained.Turns’ was overwhelmed when he made that final stop. “I cried,” he said, and remembered his wife showing a similar response when he told her what happened. “I always call her when I leave work and she asks me how my day was. It was a tearjerker. It was very touching and humbling.”“Blink and you’ll miss it,” Joe Calhoun, a longtime resident, said of Dauphin. “But there is something so special here.

47,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980. After his speech, the Republican nominee won a standing ovation and the endorsement of the 35,000-member union. (AP Photo/Charles W. Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Chris Coons and Tom Carper, also voted against the measure.Sanders was not pleased by the defeat on the Senate floor, vowing to keep pressing the matter.“If any senator believes this is the last time they will cast a vote on whether or not to give a raise to 32 million Americans, they are sorely mistaken,” said Sanders, who chairs the Budget Committee. “We’re going to keep bringing it up, and we’re going to get it done because it is what the American people demand and need.”The vote was not expressive of where senators stand on the $15 minimum wage hike. Rather than a straight up-or-down vote on the issue, Sanders’ amendment sought to override the parliamentarian’s ruling that the wage increase (a policy change rather than mere fund allocation) could not be included in the bill and still passed via budget reconciliation, a process which requires only 50 votes and a vice-presidential tiebreaker.Sanders needed to win 60 votes outright on Friday to get around that procedural hurdle, an unlikely outcome in an evenly-split Senate.EconomyPoliticsAngus KingBernie Sandersfederal minimum wageJeanne ShaheenJoe ManchinJon TesterKyrsten SinemaMaggie HassanSenate.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
49,"Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) plans to end capacity restrictions on restaurants, retail stores, other businesses, and houses of worship beginning March 19, but still require social distancing and masks in these same settings, he announced Thursday.ICYMI: Watch today's news briefing with the latest updates on COVID-19 in Connecticut https://t.co/6es6dEUsrX pic.twitter.com/Tw0OjlRC3I— Governor Ned Lamont (@GovNedLamont) March 4, 2021In exclusive comments to Breitbart News, radio host Todd Feinburg said of the anticipated lifting of restrictions, “Any suggestion that the governor of Connecticut is being accommodating to a conservative, liberty-based viewpoint regarding shutdowns is just fake news.”“It’s only a big restaurant that would have enough space that they’d be able to have their full capacity there, that it would be enough to make a difference to even the number of covers they’re able to do in a night,” explained Feinburg, host of The Todd Feinburg Show on WTIC, Connecticut’s dominant conservative talk station.“So, if you have a restaurant that’s rated for 100 people, and social distancing pushes you down to 65, then you’ve gotten a little bit of improvement, but you’ve still got the same logistical issues that restrict your capacity,” he added.According to the planned revised regulations, tables in restaurants may have no more than eight patrons, and must be spaced six feet apart or separated by Plexiglass shields. Additionally, the 11 p.m. curfew will remain, and bars that do not serve food will still be closed.While we are revising some of the COVID-19 protocols on capacity and travel restrictions, those related to face coverings, social distancing, and cleaning measures, among others, are being maintained, and we urge everyone to continue following them.🔗https://t.co/A7hzMFRCWy pic.twitter.com/uPg8MhGgaR— Governor Ned Lamont (@GovNedLamont) March 4, 2021Lamont emphasized Connecticut would not be following the path of other states that have ended mask mandates and other restrictions.“This is not Texas. This is not Mississippi. This is Connecticut,” the governor said. “We are maintaining the masks.”“I think I told you at the start, I think over the course of a year, we know what works, and masks work,” Lamont added, crediting the wearing of masks as “good defense” leading to the trend of fewer fatalities associated with the virus.The governor added his “vaccination plan” was “good offense.”In February, as CT Post reported, Lamont reversed his COVID-19 vaccination priority plan from simple age groupings, beginning with the oldest residents, to include teachers, “shifting priority away from essential workers and those with underlying medical conditions.”The Post continued:While state officials touted the new plan as a more efficient way to ramp up vaccinations, the approach deviates from guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, the CT Food Association and several labor unions criticized the governor for leaving behind frontline essential workers and those with medical conditions that make them more susceptible to COVID complications.“The educator clinics are going, are underway right now,” Lamont said during the briefing Thursday. “We have 100 facilities around the state getting our, um, our educators vaccinated. That’s not just teachers, but the paras, and the nurses, and the food service workers, and the custodians, and the drivers and everybody related to keeping our schools open.”According to the data presented, approximately 60 percent of Connecticut residents who are 65 years of age and older have received a COVID vaccine, leading to a drop in hospitalizations, deaths, and new cases of the coronavirus.Lamont said, “Connecticut has earned” the change in restrictions.“You know, it’s been tough, and people have been frustrated,” he added. “They’ve been sheltered at home, and a lot of our businesses really suffered, and people took a hit.”Feinburg said Lamont is attempting to achieve a political goal of appearing to be keeping people safe while moving the economy along.“The problem in my mind with having politicians who have to run for office, managing things centrally, is that they aren’t concerned primarily about the effective management of the state; they’re concerned about the effective management of their political careers,” he said, and continued:So, if you’re governor in a state like Connecticut, where there is actually a strong threat of conservatism and libertarianism, along with a strong force of leftism, the left wants you to take care of them, because that’s what Democrats sell: ‘We care for you we want to keep you safe.’ But there’s this whole other chunk of the population that wants to be left alone and believes in the American system of government that government should stay out of our way, and only be taking care of the things minimally that you need a government to be doing.Feinburg said the governor’s motivation is to satisfy both sides, but over the long term the damage that ultimately hurts political careers is likely what happens to the economy.“And it’s not hard to imagine that, once the virus is gone and under control, assuming the vaccines are able to bring that result, then people are going to be thinking about the economy and looking at how incredibly damaged the country is,” he said.HealthPoliticsScienceConnecticutcoronavirus pandemicCovid VaccineCOVID-19economymasksNed LamontSmall Businessesteachers' unionsTodd Feinburg.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
50,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
51,"Several prominent Democrats expressed disappointment and frustration after several Democrats joined Republicans in the Senate in rejecting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.While the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the $15 minimum wage hike could not be included in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure, Sanders, as well as his far-left allies, attempted to pave a way to make the hike a reality.Seven Democrats, as well as an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, joined Republicans in rejecting the effort on Friday.

52,"The upcoming Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for vaccinated individuals will not be a return to pre-pandemic normalcy, according to CNN.The CDC is finalizing guidance for those who have been vaccinated in the United States. Over 82.5 million coronavirus vaccines have been administered as of Thursday.While the final guidance has yet to be released, it is expected to advise those who have been fully vaccinated to only “have social interactions at small home gatherings with other fully vaccinated people,” per Politico. According to Politico‘s preview, “the guidelines said that vaccinated individuals should continue to adhere to mask and social distancing guidance in public.”CNN said the CDC confirmed Politico’s description regarding the small, maskless social gatherings. But, according to CNN, the guidelines will not have a pre-pandemic feel.“It’s not like going back to 2019,” the outlet assessed, urging readers to refrain from tossing their cloth masks.CNN added there is “no guarantee that vaccinated people may not still carry virus in their noses or throats — virus that may not make the carrier sick, but that could be spewed out and infect someone yet unvaccinated.”A Biden official said the guidelines will not provide specifics for every scenario, but they will provide “principles for people to think through.”“It will give people the means to think through it and then they can choose what level of risk they wish to take,” the official said.More than 82 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in the United States, according to the CDC, 16.3 percent of people receiving at least one dose. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the U.S. must have a majority of Americans vaccinated, 75-80 percent, to create an “umbrella of protection over the community that the level of community spread will be really, really very low.”A Harvard CAPS-Harris poll released this week showed 41 percent of Americans remain unwilling to receive a vaccination for the Wuhan virus.HealthPoliticsSciencecoronavirusmasksU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
53,"Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that advisers to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) intervened with officials of the New York State Department of Health in July and caused them to underreport the number of COVID-19 deaths in the state at that time by at least 2,800, and possibly more.The primary purpose of this New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) report, as initially published July 6, 2020 using the significantly underreported COVID-19 nursing home death data, appears to have been to absolve Gov. Cuomo of responsibility for the dramatic increase in nursing home COVID-19 deaths that took place in the immediate aftermath of his March 25, 2020 order requiring nursing homes to accept COVID-19 positive residents.“A survey conducted by NYSDOH shows that approximately 6,326 COVID-positive residents were admitted to facilities between March 25, 2020 and May 8, 2020,” the July 6, 2020 NYSDOH report stated:However, an analysis of the timing of admissions versus fatalities shows that it could not be the driver of nursing home infections or fatalities. An individual nursing home-by-nursing home analysis of admissions versus fatalities further supports this finding.A causal link between the admission policy and infections/fatalities would be supported through a direct link in timing between the two, meaning that if admission of patients into nursing homes caused infection—and by extension mortality— the time interval between the admission and mortality curves would be consistent with the expected interval between infection and death.However, the peak date COVID-positive residents entered nursing homes occurred on April 14, 2020, a week after peak mortality in New York’s nursing homes occurred on April 8, 2020. If admissions were driving fatalities, the order of the peak fatalities and peak admissions would have been reversed.But Thursday’s reports in the Journal and the Times serve to undermine the credibility of that absolution for Cuomo, since the underlying data underreported COVID-19 nursing home deaths by at least 40 percent, if not more, during the March 25 to May 8, 2020 time period when COVID-19 positive patients were admitted to nursing homes.Citing “people with knowledge of the report’s production,” the Journal reported the details in a story titled “Cuomo Advisers altered Report on COVID-19 Nursing Home Deaths: Changes resulted in a significant undercount of the death toll attributed to long-term-care facility residents.”New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s top advisers successfully pushed state health officials to strip a public report of data showing that more nursing-home residents had died of Covid-19 than the administration had acknowledged, according to people with knowledge of the report’s production.The July report, which examined the factors that led to the spread of the virus in nursing homes, focused only on residents who died inside long-term-care facilities, leaving out those who had died in hospitals after becoming sick in nursing homes. As a result, the report said 6,432 nursing-home residents had died—a significant undercount of the death toll attributed to the state’s most vulnerable population, the people said. The initial version of the report said nearly 10,000 nursing-home residents had died in New York by July last year, one of the people said.The changes Mr. Cuomo’s aides and health officials made to the nursing-home report, which haven’t been previously disclosed, reveal that the state possessed a fuller accounting of out-of-facility nursing-home deaths as early as the summer. The Health Department resisted calls by state and federal lawmakers, media outlets and others to release the data for another eight months. (emphasis added)The latest revelation in the expanding Cuomo nursing home scandal comes on the heels of a report last month from the Empire Center for Public Policy that “undermines claims by the New York State Department of Health that Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D-NY) controversial March 25 order requiring nursing homes in the state to admit coronavirus-positive residents had no impact on nursing home coronavirus death rates.”In that report, titled, “COVID-positive Admissions Were Correlated with Higher Death Rates in New York Nursing Homes,” the Albany, New York, based think tank concluded, “The admission of coronavirus-positive patients into New York nursing homes under March 25 guidance from the New York State Department of Health was associated with a statistically significant increase in resident deaths.”Cuomo’s controversial March 25, 2020, guidance was in effect until May 10, 2020.“Statewide, the findings imply that COVID-positive new admissions between late March and early May, which numbered 6,327, were associated with several hundred and possibly more than 1,000 additional resident deaths,” (emphasis added) the Empire Center study found .The conclusion of the Empire Center study stated:The data indicate that the March 25 memo was not the sole or primary cause of the heavy death toll in nursing homes, which stood at approximately 13,200 as of early this month [February 2021]. At the same time, the findings contradict a central conclusion of the Health Department’s July 6 report on coronavirus in nursing homes, which said, among other things: “Admission policies were not a significant factor in nursing home fatalities” and “The data do not show a consistent relationship between admissions and increased mortality.”The Journal reported back in September that Cuomo’s aides reviewed the July report:State health officials said in a July report that long-term-care facilities were already rife with infection by the March 25 nursing-home order, attributing the spread among patients to employees who brought the virus with them to work.Senior members of Mr. Cuomo’s staff reviewed and edited the report before it was published, state officials said. The governor’s team also withheld approval for the resumption of nursing-home visitations, people familiar with the matter said, and rejected a Health Department proposal for a regional approach to easing the ban.A Health Department spokesman said the agency had taken a thoughtful approach that involves “monitoring the data, reviewing reasonable requests and recognizing that this pandemic is not over.” (emphasis added)The New York Times details the coverup citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths.Cuomo (D) faced early criticism in his state for ordering nursing homes to take patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, as the elderly are among those most vulnerable to the virus.After reports surfaced in February that Cuomo was intentionally hiding the numbers, the governor’s office explained he was withholding the truth to prevent then-President Donald Trump’s administration from using the data to launch a politically motivated attack.Cuomo blamed the “toxic political environment” and “disinformation” for the revised numbers.But the Times states Cuomo began hiding the truth about the numbers long before the Justice Department began their investigation in August.The June numbers showed the actual death toll in nursing homes was “roughly 50 percent higher” than the numbers ultimately cited by the Cuomo administration, according to the Times.The actual number of 9,250 nursing home deaths by June were much larger than the reported 6,432 nursing-home deaths — more than a 40 percent increase.HealthPoliticsScienceCOVID-19Gov.

55,"Two female aides have departed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) administration as the embattled governor reels from twin scandals sparked by his handling of coronavirus death data regarding his state’s nursing homes and allegations of sexual harassment.Bloomberg News reported Friday:Press secretary Caitlin Girouard and interim policy adviser Erin Hammond have left, the administration said on Friday. […] Girouard, who departed on Friday, had issued the statement last month denying sexual-harassment allegations of Cuomo’s first accuser, former economic aide Lindsay Boylan. She said Boylan’s claims were “quite simply false” in a statement issued on Feb. 24.“Caitlin is a world-class, top-flight communications professional who is well respected in New York, Washington, and beyond,” Cuomo communications director Peter Ajemian said in a statement. “She’s been a real rock for our press shop, especially during the past year fighting the pandemic, and we wish her nothing but the best in her next chapter.”Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Cuomo, said Hammond had planned to leave her post months ago.“Her departure allows her to focus on her family,” Azzopardi said.The development comes one day after the New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported that top Cuomo aides pressed state health officials to revise a July report to solely count nursing home residents who died in long-term care facilities. Melissa DeRosa, secretary to the governor, is said to have been involved in the matter. DeRosa also admitted that staffers withheld the number of coronavirus deaths in the state’s nursing homes to shield the Cuomo administration from a federal investigation, according to the New York Post.It’s the latest blow for Cuomo, who’s been besieged by a one-two punch of scandals involving his handling of nursing home deaths and accusations that he sexually harassed two former aides and a woman that he met at a wedding he officiated.Cuomo had apologized Wednesday for acting “in a way that made people feel uncomfortable” but rejected calls for his resignation and said he would fully cooperate with the state attorney general’s investigation into the sexual harassment allegations. Federal investigators are scrutinizing his administration’s handling of nursing home data.Top Democrats in the state have said they want those investigations to conclude before they make a judgment about Cuomo’s conduct, but in the wake of Thursday night’s report, a few state lawmakers renewed calls for the governor to either resign or be ousted.The Associated Press contributed to this report. PoliticsAndrew CuomoNew York.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

That money won’t be held up.

58,"A school in Lubbock,Texas, held a “Rules of Chivalry Day” to compare and contrast how men and women court or date in Medieval compared to modern times, but a report in the Dallas Morning News about the assignment slammed it for telling girls to be subservient and feminine to please the boys.The document, which only included instructions for the “ladies” and not for the “men,” said:The assignment also said the ladies should provide the men in the classroom with refreshments.Here’s a really … interesting … assignment on chivalry from @shallowaterisd.

The ladies in the class will follow the Rules of Chivalry Day. All ladies deemed worth of the honor by the gentlemen receive 10 points for every signature at the end of the day. The New York Post reported on the criticism that led to the lesson being nixed:Male students were also reportedly given advisories — including referring to girls as “milady” and showing “courtly courtesy as they assist ladies who may have dropped an article by picking it up for them,” according to a subsequent tweet.Boys were also told not to use vulgarity or complain and to rise when females entered or exited a room.Twitter reactions varied — with some speculating that the assignments were supposed to demonstrate regressive gender roles of the period. But most respondents found the material unacceptable no matter the intent. The school eventually canceled the concept outright.“This assignment has been reviewed, and despite its historical context, it does not reflect our district and community values,” Dr. Anita Herbert, superintendent of the local district told Fox News. “The matter has been addressed with the teacher, and the assignment was removed.”Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comEducationPoliticschivalrycourtingDatinggentlemenladiesMedievalschool curriculumTexas.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
59,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday conceded President Joe Biden would have a press conference in “coming weeks” and “before the end of the month.”A recent CNN analysis of the past 100 years shows the 15 most recent presidents have all held a formal solo press conference within 33 days of taking office. This is President Biden’s 44th day in office.Psaki blamed Biden’s focus on the coronavirus pandemic for the delay, arguing that the president’s time, energy, and focus was on solving the crisis.“I think the American people would certainly understand if his focus and his energy and his attention has been on ensuring we secure enough vaccines to vaccinate all Americas,” she said.Since taking office, however, President Biden has spent three weekends away from the White House, including two at his home in Deleware and one at the presidential retreat at Camp David.Biden’s refusal to host a press conference fits a pattern of behavior exhibited by his staff during his presidential campaign. Despite historic gaps between press conferences, Biden’s campaign staff ignored reporter complaints of his reduced public engagement with the press during the coronavirus pandemic.Psaki argued president Biden had taken questions a couple of times after events at the White House, noting that he had answered questions from reporters “almost 40 times” since becoming president.Biden has put a number of presidential traditions on hold since becoming president, citing the coronavirus pandemic and his goal to get a rescue package passed.Psaki said the traditional presidential speech to a joint session of Congress, typically taking place in February, has been delayed until after Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion American Rescue plan has passed.PoliticsJen PsakiJoe Bidenpress conferenceWhite House.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
60,"Democrats voted against his amendment to the proposed coronavirus relief package that would have stopped American taxpayers’ money from going to illegal aliens in $1,400 stimulus checks, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Saturday.Sen. Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall.

61,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

63,"Most Americans see China as an enemy or competitor, according to a study by the Pew Research Center.The study, conducted February 1-7, found 89 percent of adults in the U.S. consider China a competitor or an enemy, not a partner. “Many also support taking a firmer approach to the bilateral relationship, whether by promoting human rights in China, getting tougher on China economically or limiting Chinese students studying abroad in the United States,” Pew Research reported.The study found about nine percent of Americans consider China a partner, while 55 percent consider the country a competitor, and 34 percent consider it to be an enemy of the United States.In the poll, Americans responded that they are seriously concerned about Chinese cyberattacks, increasing military/technological power, human rights abuses, and the trade deficit. “Democrats are more likely than Republicans to describe China as a partner, they are also more likely to describe it as a competitor, with nearly two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic leaners (65%) describing the relationship in this way,” Pew said.On Wednesday, Freedom House released the 2021 edition of its annual Freedom in the World report, charting an alarming “deterioration of democracy” around the world in 2020.

Democrats inherited a tide that was already turning,” McConnell said Friday as the Senate awaits a vote on the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation.“We could have worked together to do something smart & bipartisan to finish this fight ASAP.

It’s obvious in this package that they don’t when nine percent is actually going toward COVID relief, and then they’re packaging this as relief for Americans,” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) told Breitbart News during an appearance at CPAC last week:“Relief for who? It’s relief in the form of a Biden blue state bailout, and this is exactly what the American people are tired of: $1.9 trillion? It’s our children. It’s our children’s children who will have to pay that back, and it’s devastating what they’re doing to our country in the name of relief and then trying to make Republicans just look like mean, bad people,” Boebert continued.“But we know that there’s still $1 trillion that’s already been passed and approved that’s unspent. Let’s spend that $1 trillion before loading up a brand new bill full of pork,” she said, asking why art institutes are getting “millions of dollars when the American people are sitting at home waiting on a $1,400 check.”“Progressives are incentivizing Americans to vote for Democrats because they think they’re someone going to get some sort of bonus from it. Maybe $2,000 checks. Well, no,” she added. “We’re getting a president who’s bringing us back into endless wars, and just making money out of thin air.”The final vote on the legislation has been delayed due to Sen.

66,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

67,"More than three-quarters of the “child” migrants who recently crossed the border into government custody are teenagers who claim ages of 15 to 17, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).The data contradicts the narrative by President Joe Biden’s deputies — and by much of the media — who suggest the young migrants are children traveling alone to seek safety in the United States.“We are not apprehending a 9-year-old child, who has come alone, who has traversed Mexico … whose loving parents sent that child alone,” insisted Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re not expelling that 9-year-old child to Mexico when that child’s country of origin was Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador,” Mayorkas said on March 1.Only 13 percent of the 5,126 minor migrants in HHS custody on January 31 were younger than 12, according to the HHS data. Seventy-one percent were males.The non-adult migrants are legally defined as “Unaccompanied Alien Children” (UACs) even though they are accompanied to the border by coyotes, who are working under contracts with their parents or labor brokers.Many of the migrant teenagers — as well as some young men who understate their age — are heading north to find work, often goaded by the economic success of older men in their home villages, migration experts said.“It’s definitely jobs,” said Rob Law, the director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies.“There’s no doubt about it that the overwhelming number of aliens are economic migrants,” Law said, who worked as policy director in former-President Donald Trump’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency. “They pose as humanitarian cases … [but] their true intention is simply to come here and take American jobs.”On January 30, the Los Angeles Times reported the deaths of 13 Guatemalan teenagers killed by gunmen as they approached the cartel-controlled U.S.-Mexican border. The victims included 15-year-old Robelson Isidro:He earned just $3 a day toiling in the coffee fields around Comitancillo, a largely indigenous town in Guatemala’s western highlands. With a few years of American wages, he hoped to buy the family a house.…The [Guatemalan] community has a long history of sending migrants to the United States, and [Isidro] had uncles who lived there. They had indoor kitchens. They didn’t have to cook outside under a tarp.“He was ashamed,” his mother said in a phone interview. She said he told her: “I’m going to fight to make my dreams come true. I have to get my siblings ahead in life. I’m going to get them out of poverty.”A 2017 International Organization for Migration study showed economic reasons fueled 91 percent of Guatemalan migration to the United States. Less than one percent migrated because of concerns about crime.“Honestly, I think almost everyone in the system knows that most of the [migrant] teens are coming to work and send money back home,” Maria Woltjen, executive director and founder of the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, told a reporter for ProPublica. “They want to help their parents,” she told ProPublica for a November 2020 article, reporting:Around Urbana-Champaign, the home of the University of Illinois, school district officials say children and adolescents lay shingles, wash dishes and paint off-campus university apartments. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, an indigenous Guatemalan labor leader has heard complaints from adult workers in the fish-packing industry who say they’re losing their jobs to 14-year-olds. In Ohio, teenagers work in dangerous chicken plants.…Some began to work when they were just 13 or 14, packing the candy you find by the supermarket register, cutting the slabs of raw meat that end up in your freezer and baking, in industrial ovens, the pastries you eat with your coffee. Garcia, who is 18 now, was 15 when he got his first job at an automotive parts factory.On March 4, Biden spoke with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei Falla about developing a “humane and effective migration plan.”More than 117,000 young migrants are expected to come to the US this year:Joe Biden's deputies announce they expect 117,000 ""unaccompanied"" young migrants this year.Resident illegals, coyotes & cartels will be very happy to meet the new target. This is not a surprise 'crisis.' This is gov't-planned 'extraction migration.'https://t.co/5obvzhr7EZ— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 3, 2021In 2016, GOP Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) worked with Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) to investigate the trafficking of teenagers into America’s labor force.The subsequent bipartisan report, “Protecting Unaccompanied Alien Children from Trafficking and Other Abuses: The Role of the Office of Refugee Resettlement,” spotlighted one example of coyotes smuggling migrant children north in exchange for slave-like indentured labor in American workplaces:In a number of cases, however, parents who consented to the placement of their children with certain [unrelated] sponsors were also complicit in the child’s smuggling. In the Marion cases, for example, several victims’ family members attested to the asserted relationship, but there was a reason: The human traffickers held the deeds to some of the families’ homes as collateral for the child’s journey to the United States. The sooner the child was released from HHS custody, the sooner they could begin working to repay the debt. Other cases revealed that parents have deceived HHS by claiming that a relationship existed between the sponsor and the UAC when it did not.…Once HHS released the minor victims to the defendants, they were forced to work at egg farms in Marion and other locations for six or seven days a week, twelve hours per day. The work was physically demanding and, according to the indictment, included tasks such as de-beaking chickens and cleaning chicken coops. The minor victims were forced to live in “substandard” trailers owned by the traffickers. The traffickers withheld the victims’ paychecks and gave them very little money for food and necessities. The traffickers would threaten the victims and their family members with physical harm, and even death, if they did not work or surrender their entire paychecks. The minor victims were not given an accounting of their debt and often had their debt increased beyond what was initially agreed upon. One of the traffickers assaulted a victim for refusing to turn over his paycheck. The traffickers punished another minor victim when he complained about working at the egg farm by moving him to a different trailer “that was unsanitary and unsafe, with no bed, no heat, no hot water, no working toilets, and vermin.” The traffickers then called the minor victim’s father and threatened to shoot the father in the head if the minor victim did not work. The traffickers used physical violence against the minor victims to keep them in line and to ensure they continued to do as they were told. The indictment alleges that the defendants “used a combination of threats, humiliation, deprivation, financial coercion, debt manipulation, and monitoring to create a climate of fear and helplessness that would compel [the victims’] compliance.”Portman’s report added that “investigators were told by an unidentified victim of the traffickers that approximately 20 other Guatemalan minors were being forced to work at eggs farms to pay off their smuggling debt.”On March 4, as thousands of migrant youth crossed the border at the invitation of President Joe Biden, Portman issued an email statement:Each day brings new reports of a surge of arrivals at the U.S. southern border, which we know will increase the risk of trafficking in persons, especially for unaccompanied children arriving in greater numbers.Over the course of the three bipartisan reports and hearings I led as the Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations I found, across two different administrations, concerning failures to ensure the safety of—or even keep track of—these vulnerable children once they were handed off to sponsors, as well as a fundamental refusal by agencies to accept that they were responsible for their welfare.… I urge the Biden Administration to ensure that all critical procedures are followed to ensure the safety of these children like fingerprinting of the sponsors, criminal background checks, and home visits because the U.S. federal government cannot allow these children to fall victim to human trafficking, abuse, or other harm. The agencies of jurisdiction must meet their responsibilities under the law.Most major media outlets simply ignore the reality of teenage migrant workers. NBC’s Jacob Soboroff and Julia Ainsley, for example, wrote on March 4:NBC News reported that more than 625 children have been held in Border Patrol custody over the 72 hour legal limit and the administration projects 117,000 unaccompanied children could cross the border this year, far surpassing previous records.“We are looking at a number of different types of shelters that are required in the best interest of the children and to address the public health imperative of the American people,” Mayorkas said. “We understand the sigificance of the number of children. It speaks to the fact that there is quite frankly pent-up desperation from three countries that have suffered so much violence, so much poverty and other adverse conditions.”In a separate article, Soboroff and Ainsley skated over the issue, writing on March 3, “The data also showed that 95 of the 625 who had been waiting more than 72 hours for transfer to custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, were under 13 years old.”The data NBC cited suggests 85 percent of the 625 migrant minors were older than 14.The Washington Post uses “minors” to conflate children and teenagers. Sometimes Axios recognizes the high number of teenagers.“Illegal aliens are highly rational thinkers,” said Law. “When you have open-borders policies [with] a wink and a nod [from DHS officials], you know the United States under the Biden administration is not going to enforce the law against you, rationally, you should come, and that’s exactly what they’re doing.”The migrants’ rational calculations, he added, are “deeply harmful to Americans, who are the victims of reckless and lawless policies in the Biden administration.”:Progressives (& biz) cheerlead the 'Hunger Games' obstacle-course trail that delivers migrants to the US, despite Americans' expectation for a capped & orderly immig system. The trail inflicts much damage & death, but progressives demand diversity first.https://t.co/90s5dnQQ4l— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 11, 2021EconomyImmigrationPoliticsAlejandro MayorkasHuman TraffickingMigrantsUACs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
68,"A majority of voters believe GOP lawmakers in Congress have “lost touch” with Republican voters, a Rasmussen Reports survey released Thursday found.“Over the past several years, have Republicans in Congress done a good job of representing Republican values?” the survey asked. A majority of likely voters, 57 percent, expressed the belief such lawmakers “have lost touch with Republican voters from throughout the nation” compared to 29 percent who said they have done a “good job of representing Republican values.”A majority of Republicans, 51 specifically, agreed GOP lawmakers have lost touch with Republican voters, compared to 41 percent who said they have done a good job and eight percent who remain unsure.The survey asked the same question of Democrats and found a plurality of likely voters, 49 percent, indicating the belief Democrat lawmakers, too, have lost touch with their base. Forty percent disagreed. However, Democrat voters do not feel the same way. Sixty-two percent said Democrat lawmakers have done a good job representing their values compared to 32 percent who said they lost touch.A majority of independent voters tend to believe both GOP and Democrat lawmakers have lost touch with their bases, 65 percent and 51 percent, respectively.The survey, taken from February 28 to March 1 among 1,000 U.S. likely voters, has a margin of error of +/- 3 percent.The news comes as congressional Republicans attempt to unite despite an underlying tone of division between the establishment and GOP base — division that became all the more evident after ten GOP House lawmakers voted to impeach former President Trump and seven GOP senators voted to convict. Those included Sens. Richard Burr (R-NC), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Pat Toomey (R-PA), and Mitt Romney (R-UT).A Rasmussen Reports survey released last month showed nearly three-quarters of Republican voters wanting the party to be “more like former President Trump” moving forward.PoliticsDemocratsGOPRasmussen ReportsRepublican PartyRepublicans.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
69,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 Chinese coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.The New York Times details the coverup citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths.Cuomo (D) faced early criticism in his state for ordering nursing homes to take patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, as the elderly are among those most vulnerable to the virus.After reports surfaced in February that Cuomo was intentionally hiding the numbers, the governor’s office explained he was withholding the truth to prevent then-President Donald Trump’s administration from using the data to launch a politically motivated attack.Cuomo blamed the “toxic political environment” and “disinformation” for the revised numbers.But the Times states Cuomo began hiding the truth about the numbers long before the Justice Department began their investigation in August.The June numbers showed the actual death toll in nursing homes was “roughly 50 percent higher” than the numbers ultimately cited by the Cuomo administration, according to the Times.The actual number of 9,250 nursing home deaths by June were much larger than the reported 6,432 nursing-home deaths — more than a 40 percent increase.According to the Wall Street Journal, the governor’s advisers stripped the number of nursing home residents who died after they were transferred to a hospital from the report, making the death toll look better for Cuomo.The doctored report, released in July, allowed Cuomo to continue trumpeting his success in fighting the virus in New York.“Whatever happens, this is going to be a period to learn from,” Cuomo said in a radio interview on July 10, just after the doctored information was released. “I am now thinking about writing a book about what we went through, lessons learned, the entire experience, because if we don’t learn from this, then it will really compound the whole crisis that we’ve gone through.”More than 15,000 New Yorkers in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have died from the Chinese coronavirus since March 2020.HealthPoliticsAndrew CuomocoronavirusNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

71,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

72,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

74,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980.

Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
75,"Elections have been center-stage for two weeks, starting with the Supreme Court’s abdicating its duty to resolve serious problems with our elections, to former President Donald Trump’s CPAC speech, to the House’s passing H.R. 1 on a party-line vote. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett disappointed the nation, but Republicans must unite to stop the illegal problems of 2020 from permanently becoming legal, which will happen if H.R. 1 passes the Senate.H.R. 1 is an existential threat to America’s form of government, because it would create one-party rule with a Democrat Party permanently dominated by socialists and communists. (And hopefully Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) will keep his word to preserve the filibuster, because if H.R. 1 passes, the moderate wing of the Democrat Party would be forever eradicated, and his grandchildren would live in a country radical leftists control.)So Republicans cannot afford to be in a circular firing squad taking shots at each other over why the Supreme Court does not have a majority of constitutional conservatives who are willing to head toward the sounds of gunfire to decide the most contentious issues. I don’t know if the GOP civil war has been canceled like Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said, but it needs to be postponed until we beat the deadly threat that is one step from destroying the GOP. Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell need to get along for the next 20 months, along with all their supporters.Trump’s speech at CPAC Sunday hit hard on the issue of election integrity, and how the Supreme Court let down not just 75 million Trump voters, but every American, because elections are indispensable to the constitutional form of government that governs everyone in this nation for all generations. Yet the justices refused by one vote to hear any cases raising serious constitutional problems with the 2020 elections in several key states, with Kavanaugh and Barrett disappointing all those who supported their elevation to the High Court, as either one could have supplied the needed vote to grant review.Then late Wednesday night, the House passed H.R. 1 by a vote of 220-210. Every single Republican voted against it, and every Democrat except one voted for it. That’s because both sides understand that this is an attempt at a federal takeover of elections on cynical terms that will enable Democrats to rig the election process forever, taking everything that went wrong in 2020 – and don’t let Democrats and the media lie to you, there were massive and widespread irregularities – and make those travesties permanent nationwide.I’ve been in national politics since the Reagan years in the 1980s, ran elections for eight years as Ohio secretary of state – where we were Ground Zero in the 2004 presidential election – been chairman of a national campaign, and been on the ballot many times myself. I’ve never seen election laws not followed on as broad a scale as we saw in 2020, irregularities resulting in lawsuits. It looked more like elections I’ve seen when serving as an official election observer in troubled countries overseas.Trump was right to hammer H.R. 1 in his CPAC speech, which would take all the vulnerabilities in current law exposed by the 2020 lawsuits and convert those problems into legal requirements. And Trump was right to say that the Supreme Court let us down by failing to hear any of the appeals from lawsuits in states were judges and election administrators rewrote state election laws, because the Constitution says that state legislatures decide how presidential electors are appointed, not judges and election administrators. That means that because every state legislature passed laws long ago – mostly in the 1800s – saying that state’s Electoral College members every four years are the electors supporting the winner of the statewide popular vote, then the statewide election must be conducted according to those laws as the legislature wrote them.But in at least a half-dozen states, the election deviated from what the legislature mandated in state law. So people sued, and then they asked the Supreme Court to take it up. The justices’ courage to do so in 2000 is how Republicans won the White House in Bush v. Gore.Yet the Supreme Court dashed Republicans’ and conservatives’ hopes for vindication and stage-setting for election reform when it voted 6-3 not to take up any of four cases raising legal issues from the 2020 election. The vote was only 6-3 because Kavanaugh and Barrett voted to reject those appeals.Frustrated constitutional conservatives are left asking: What must be done to get originalists on the Supreme Court who are unafraid of the Left and will do their job? Democrats never fail to get liberals on the Court. Why can’t Republicans get conservatives who don’t buckle under media pressure?Ronald Reagan was hit-or-miss on Supreme Court nominees, with courageous conservatives like Antonin Scalia and William Rehnquist, but also moderates like Sandra Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy.There was even more of a whiplash with George H.W. Bush (Bush 41), who gave America both the Court’s most consistently principled constitutional originalist, Clarence Thomas, and someone who turned out to be a full-on liberal, David Souter.Although George W. Bush (Bush 43) didn’t pick any Souters, he gave us one true conservative fighter in Samuel Alito, but also an establishment elite Republican in John Roberts, who has caved on Obamacare, amnesty for illegals, the census, abortion, and other issues.Then we had the Trump presidency. Scalia died unexpectedly during the 2016 campaign. Trump came up with his public list of Supreme Court possibilities, which was expanded several times. He had a team in the White House, more people at the Justice Department, and consulted with outside advisers from the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation.And Trump got great intel from those outside advisers. But anyone on the outside can do only so much. The loudest voices are the ones in the room speaking to the president each day.Out of that process, we got Neil Gorsuch. He’s brilliant and a fighter. Even if his libertarian philosophy drives conservatives nuts on some important issues, he’s definitely been a hard-changer on the Constitution’s mandate that presidential electors are chosen by the system established by state legislatures, which means enforcing state election laws as the legislature wrote them.Then we got Kavanaugh in 2018. We fought through the ugliest confirmation any of us can remember. And we got some type of conservative, and on the religious liberty cases brought by organizations I work with he’s voted for a conservative view of the Constitution. No doubt he will on various other issues, too.But why won’t Kavanaugh fight? Whether he’s listening to Roberts or the mainstream media, Kavanaugh needs to embrace the fact that the Constitution gives him a lifetime appointment so he can ignore politicians and public opinion and focus solely on the law. You cannot uphold the Constitution if you don’t vote to take cases where the Constitution is at stake.In October, Kavanaugh voted to weigh in on one of these election cases. In February, he reversed himself on the same case. Kavanaugh can’t let the Swamp and the Far Left intimidate him (if that’s what’s happened), or let Roberts’ focus on protecting the Court instead of the Constitution become his focus, too.And then we have Barrett. The 2020 election cases were Barrett’s first big test, and she failed. Scalia would be disappointed in his star former law clerk. These appeals needed to be heard, for all the reasons Thomas explained in his dissent. This kind of controversy sits at the heart of why we have an independent judiciary, and until the Supreme Court decides these issues they will come back again, could change the outcome of future close elections, and further erode Americans’ confidence in democracy.To the battle at hand, if the Supreme Court had shined a spotlight on those state-law problems from November it would have helped inform the public and keep those problems from being made permanent in federal law in H.R. 1.Yet Barret is brand new. As damaging as her decision not to take the 2020 election cases is, if the Republic survives by defeating H.R. 1 anyway, she yet has time to redeem herself by making this a one-off to what could still be decades of courageous service.The next Republican president needs justices who are both constitutional conservatives and willing to fight, especially when the issue is one where politicians and the public are whipped into a political feeding frenzy. The Court needs justices who will never flinch from controversy, and never run from an assault on the Constitution. History shows that many constitutional conservative issues are issues where only a fearless justice will stand strong.But all this is a discussion for 2024. Republicans will not survive that long if we allow internecine warfare to consume us now. Leftwing Democrats see a two-year window to achieve permanent power in America. This common threat requires everyone shooting in one direction, not in a circular firing squad.We need every moderate Republican and establishment Republican to stand with every grassroots MAGA activist and every constitutional conservative to defeat H.R. 1 so that the election procedures that went off the rails in our recent past do not also become our future. This is all-hands-on-deck, because in the immortal words of Benjamin Franklin, “We must all hang together, or most assuredly, we will all hang separately.”Ken Blackwell is Senior Fellow for Human Rights and Constitutional Governance at the Family Research Council.PoliticsAmy Coney BarrettBrett KavanaughDonald TrumpH.R. 1justiceSupreme Court.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

77,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
78,"Texas and Mississippi followed Florida’s lead this week and announced they would lift key business restrictions and end statewide mask mandates, but many popular retailers plan to continue requiring customers to wear face coverings in their stores.Texas and Mississippi are the latest states to announce their intention to end their statewide mask mandates, prompting criticism from President Joe Biden, who accused the leaders of engaging in “Neanderthal thinking” — a phrase White House press secretary Jen Psaki appeared to defend.“The behavior of a Neanderthal, just to be very clear,” Psaki told reporters Thursday. “The behavior of.”However, popular retailers, from Target to Walgreens, plan to keep their mask requirements in place, citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, which recommends individuals two and older wear masks in public settings, particularly when around those who are not part of their immediate household. Target and Kroger, for example, affirmed this week that they will keep store mask mandates in place, with limited exceptions.Kroger “will continue to require everyone in our stores across the country to wear masks until all our frontline grocery associates can receive the COVID-19 [coronavirus] vaccine,” a spokesperson said, according to CBS News.The Albertsons and H-E-B, however, will encourage face coverings but not require them for customers.A Walgreens spokesperson also confirmed to CBS News that the company will continue to maintain its mask requirement, but employees will not kick out customers who refuse to wear a face covering, as their policy is to “gently remind customers who are shopping without masks about the requirement.”“But out of concern for our employees’ safety, we do not stop these customers from shopping,” a spokesperson told the outlet, noting that there is “no change at this time to the company mask mandate policy or any current safety protocols that are in place in our stores.”“We are following current CDC and OSHA guidelines regarding safety protocols,” the spokesperson added.CVS is taking a similar approach.“If a customer is not wearing a mask or face covering, we will refer them to our signage and ask that they help protect themselves and those around them by listening to the experts and heeding the call to wear a face covering,” a spokesperson for the company said, as reported by CBS News.“For safety reasons, our employees are directed to avoid escalated confrontations with noncompliant customers and to instead help them complete their purchases as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson added. Aldi and Home Depot also plan to keep their mask requirements in place, citing CDC guidelines.While states continue to roll out vaccines, the CDC has not loosened its position on masks, instead recommending people to add “layers of material” to their masks, floating double-masking as a viable option.Last month, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci said Americans may have to wear masks into 2022.EconomyHealthPoliticscoronavirusCVSmasksTexasWalgreens.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
79,"Former House Speaker Paul Ryan will hold a fundraiser for embattled House GOP Conference chairwoman Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) at the end of March, an invitation obtained by Breitbart News shows.The fundraiser, a “virtual event,” is slated for Thursday, March 25 at 11 a.m. eastern. The invitation asks donors to give “suggested contributions” of $2,900 to “attend,” or $5,800 to be a “co-host” of the Ryan-Cheney event.Another interesting detail from the fundraising invitation is that the “Liz Cheney for Wyoming” campaign address to which donors are asked to make checks payable to is in Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, DC. The fact that Cheney’s campaign is headquartered in the nation’s capital rather than in the state she purports to represent is something her primary challengers will almost surely use against her.The news is significant because Cheney is facing multiple primary challenges after she voted to impeach now former President Donald Trump. Trump called her and her fellow Republican impeachment conspirators out in his speech this past weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), naming all 17 House and Senate Republicans who voted to impeach or convict him and saying they need to be removed from office.Ryan, the former Speaker under whose watch Republicans lost a historic majority back in the 2018 midterm elections, announced earlier that year before the midterms he was not running for reelection and would be retiring. Ryan’s speakership was marred by a lack of successes and failures to do any big picture accomplishments except for things like the Trump tax cuts that the then-president carried through. He left office with a historically abysmal approval rating, down at just 12 percent according to one poll, demonstrating his ineffectiveness and failure in the job.A Trump ally, when asked about the decision by Ryan to try to ride in to Cheney’s rescue by hosting this fundraiser, told Breitbart News that it is unsurprising two failed establishment politicians would hitch their wagons together.“Asking a Beltway insider like Paul Ryan to headline a fundraiser for your campaign is something only a candidate with a 13% approval rating like Liz Cheney would do,” the Trump ally told Breitbart News.A different GOP source, a consultant who works on campaigns including a number of House GOP candidates, added that this Cheney rescue plot by Ryan and his cohorts in the lobbying world of Washington is unsurprising. This official added that any donors who appear at this fundraiser should be “ashamed of themselves” and are working against the interests of the Republican Party’s push to retake the House majority in 2022.“It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the face of the pro-amnesty, pro-war swamp is trying to rescue Cheney,” the GOP official told Breitbart News. “While Liz Cheney may be royalty in the swamp, she has done more to divide the Republican Party and hinder our chances of taking back the majority than any political figure in the country. Any so-called ‘Republican’ donor who gives money to support her divisive efforts should be ashamed of themselves and are directly working against efforts to build a winning and unified coalition to retake the House in 2022.”While Ryan rode out of office in early 2019 with no achievements to his name and abysmal approval ratings after overseeing one of the biggest losses for the GOP in the 2018 midterms, his successor now House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has taken a wildly different approach to the leadership position. McCarthy, along with Trump, helped the GOP win back a net 15 seats in the 2020 congressional elections—defying all the odds and so-called experts. As such, McCarthy enjoys record-high approval ratings among the GOP base—and is the highest rated GOP congressional leader in a generation in polling.As such, it’s not all bad news for the GOP and its base. With party leaders such as McCarthy and most of the rest of his team in the House leadership—from Whip Steve Scalise to National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) chairman Tom Emmer to Republican Study Committee chairman Jim Banks—embracing Trump’s positive populist policy vision, the GOP expects a bright future in the 2022 midterm elections. As Breitbart News has reported, McCarthy and these other leaders are already making moves to get the Republican Party reorganized after the 2020 elections and focused. McCarthy has made it a point to work with Trump—even traveling to Mar-a-Lago to meet the former president to discuss 2022 and 2024 races.Ryan, meanwhile, has been—like Cheney and the nine other sitting House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump—antagonistic his whole career towards Trump. Back in 2017, Breitbart News published audio of a call during the 2016 presidential campaign in which Ryan lambasted Trump. “I am not going to defend Donald Trump—not now, not in the future,” Ryan said in that call.He has followed through on that promise to consistently and repeatedly attack and undermine Trump. Ryan, upon leaving Congress, joined the board of Fox News—a move for which Trump criticized Ryan and Fox News. Fox News took serious shots at Trump during the 2020 campaign including at the first presidential debate which Chris Wallace moderated.In addition to Ryan’s consistent undermining of Trump, Cheney has likewise been a thorn in Trump’s side for some time. After her impeachment vote, the House GOP Conference convened to discuss removing her as conference chair over not just her anti-Trump move but the fact she did not inform the conference of her decision ahead of time—thereby hurting House GOP Conference members. While she survived that push to oust her, Cheney’s repeated use of her position to engage in a personal crusade has isolated her from Republican rank-and-file members. For instance, when GOP leaders gave her another chance to be a leader instead of using her position to crusade against Trump, Cheney at a House GOP leadership press conference instead decided to use her position to force her personal anti-Trump agenda forward and attack Trump ahead of his CPAC speech. McCarthy, in contrast, defended Trump speaking at CPAC.Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is now facing challenges from state Sen. Anthony Bouchard and a newly announced candidate state Rep. Chuck Gray. Polling in the race shows Cheney in serious trouble, and likely headed for an eventual loss. Republicans across the party have repeatedly attacked her by name, and ripped her aggressively in interviews and speeches at CPAC. Her standing in the party is diminishing quickly, much like Ryan’s did after a year plus as Speaker during Trump’s presidency.PoliticsDonald TrumpFundraiserHouse of RepresentativesKevin McCarthyLiz CheneyOn the HillPaul Ryanwyoming.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
80,"President Joe Biden personally promised union labor leaders his support for natural gas despite canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline’s permit his first day in office, Mark McManus of United Association General told E&E News in a story published Thursday.The meeting’s agenda included the coronavirus relief package and infrastructure plans, according to McManus, one of the nine union leaders who met Biden in the Oval Office on February 17.“I brought up natural gas specifically to him, we spoke about pipelines … and he says, ‘I’m all for natural gas,'” McManus told E&E News.Natural gas emits less carbon dioxide than other fossil fuels.Publicly, Biden has pushed an agenda promising 100 percent clean energy by 2035.Republicans and union bosses united to condemn Biden’s executive order canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline.Before the Oval Office meeting in February, President Richard Trumka of AFL-CIO, one of the U.S.’s most prominent labor unions, said he wished Biden “hadn’t done that on the first day.”Another executive order temporarily halted new oil and gas leases on federal land while the White House conducted a “rigorous review” of all existing fossil fuel leases and permitting practices.In an effort to maintain support from the labor unions, the Biden administration is keeping close ties with unions directly affected by the energy orders. Biden’s Cabinet is hosting behind the scenes meetings with United Association, a pipefitter’s union that relies on work from fossil fuels that can not be replicated with renewable energy.McManus said, according to the report, “the administration had arranged calls between his union and Biden’s nominees to lead the Energy, Labor and Transportation departments as well as the Environmental Protection Agency,” noting that “some nominees had prioritized calling the pipefitters before senators.”But labor leaders asserted they were not consulted in the decision to shut down the Keystone Pipeline.McManus said he feared Biden’s Keystone order would be symbolic of hostility to pipelines, but in the February meeting, Biden assured union leaders his administration would assess pipelines on a case-by-case basis.EconomyEnvironmentPoliticsEmissionsgreen energyGreen New DealJoe Bidennatural gasUnions.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

83,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and former Vice President Mike Pence are tied for “second choice” in a hypothetical 2024 Republican matchup, a survey from GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio found.Former President Trump continues to dominate among the hypothetical 2024 GOP field with 51 percent support, followed by Pence (nine percent), DeSantis (seven percent), and former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley (six percent).However, voters were separately asked to choose their “second choice” to vote for in the Republican Primary for president. The results showed both DeSantis and Pence tied, garnering 22 percent support each. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) came in third with 19 percent. No other candidate, which included former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (R), Haley, Gov. Kristi Noem (R-SD), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), Gov. Larry Hogan (R), and former Gov. Chris Christie (R), saw double-digit support.Notably, Pence leads in a scenario absent of Trump, garnering 19 percent support. DeSantis follows with 17 percent, but that is within the survey’s +/- 2.7 percent margin of error. Cruz, Haley, and Romney follow with 13 percent, 8 percent, and 5 percent, respectively.Fabrizio said, at this point, it is “clear” former Trump’s supporters will “gravitate towards” candidates such as Pence, DeSantis, and Cruz if he chooses not to run.“No question at this juncture that President Trump would dominate the 2024 field with no potential challenger even breaking onto double digits,” Fabrizio said, according to Politico.DeSantis’s rise, particularly, comes as he continues to lead the way in championing an open and free state as many blue states continue to keep coronavirus restrictions in place.“There are not a whole lot of Floridians who are itching to move from Florida to lockdown states, but there are thousands and thousands of people who are seeking to leave the lockdowns behind for the greener pastures in Florida,” the Republican governor said during this week’s State of the State address.“We have long been known as the Sunshine State – but, given the unprecedented lockdowns we have witnessed in other states, I think the Florida sun now serves as a beacon of light to those who yearn for freedom,” he added.This week, Texas and Mississippi announced they, too, will lift mask mandates and other business restrictions in their respective states.Politics2024Donald TrumpFloridaMike PenceRon DeSantis.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall.

88,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate.

89,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

A group of 12 Senate Democrats led by Dianne Feinstein of California sent a letter to Biden urging him to nominate a permanent director to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, and empower that person to enact a raft of executive gun control measures.CD notes that Biden is open to some executive action for gun control but appears wary of going too far with such options.However, he makes clear he is open to a wide range of gun control legislation should Congress pass it and send it to his desk.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

91,"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said that “there is no place for racist imagery” when asked to respond to the ongoing controversy about Dr. Seuss, whom the city has honored in the past.The company that handles Dr. Seuss’s books withdrew six of his books from publication this week over concerns about early caricatures, and the left has been critical of Dr. Seuss for preaching racial tolerance without concern for “structural power imbalances.”Breitbart News asked Garcetti about the issue during a press briefing on Thursday night.Of course, there are images that are blatantly racist that have no place in 2021. And you can’t just look at a book and say, “Hey, 99% of this is great,” and there is a blatantly racist picture of somebody who is presumed to be Chinese or African. So, I know there is this whole back-and-forth about whether people are canceling folks. This is not about canceling. This is about standing up against blatant racism where we see it, and just making sure that that no longer is part of our canon. And there’s lots of ways to work around that. People can take pages out, or change them — in fact, I think, a long time before this, it’s not a 2021 event, I think there was even a word changed in a Dr. Seuss book that made it a less offensive term.  I’m not going to prescribe how it gets resolved, but there’s no place for racist imagery, racist language, in 2021 for our children.Garcetti offered a hopeful assessment of L.A”s prospects as coronavirus cases declined and vaccinations increased, saying there was “light at the end of the tunnel.”He said his favorite Dr. Seuss book was Yertle the Turtle.Joel B.

While we need to continue infection prevention practices, this decrease is also a positive sign of the impact vaccinations have in our communities.While visitors will be able to reconnect with their loved ones soon, the facilities themselves will be responsible for a more specific time.

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights. (This matches conservatives' view that transgenderism also attacks heterosexuality & health). So what is more important for progressives?

94,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
95,"Lawmakers are demanding to know why the Capitol Police is now requesting that the approximately 5,000 National Guard troops remain in the nation’s capital for another two months.Local and federal law enforcement authorities requested National Guard assistance in the wake of the January 6 Capitol building breach and asked them to remain through the January 20 inauguration. Their numbers reached as high as over 26,000 in January.Their mission is slated to end March 12, but on Thursday, lawmakers revealed there was a request by Capitol Police for the National Guard to remain another 60 days.Senate Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said in a statement he is “outraged” they are being asked to stay without clear and specific information about why.“I’m outraged that U.S. Capitol Police have requested to keep the nearly 5,000 National Guardsmen at the Capitol Complex for another two months without presenting clear and specific information. I haven’t been satisfied with any explanation Congress has received at numerous briefings that all these personnel, resources and barbed wire are needed,” he said.“The Capitol Police have clearly stated that no specific credible threat exists — and what’s more, they haven’t provided the Department of Defense with any of the information needed to justify this request,” he added.Inhofe noted that keeping the Capitol Complex safe has always been a federal civilian law enforcement responsibility.“We can and should make improvements to how the Capitol Police protect the building, and there are plenty of options available to us, such as changes to the U.S. Capitol Police force structure, availability of a non-military quick reaction force and mobile fencing,” he said.He added:What this solution should not look like is keeping the National Guardsmen here indefinitely, as has been rumored. This is not their job or their mission — and the image this would paint on the world stage is concerning. I look forward to working with law enforcement agencies and my colleagues to improve Capitol security and get our Guardsmen back home to their families.Last month, the Pentagon disclosed that the National Guard mission to protect the Capitol through mid-March would cost taxpayers $487 million. That figure will rise the longer soldiers stay.Rep. Michael Waltz (R-FL), a National Guard colonel and Green Beret, has consistently asked for a briefing from the Pentagon on why National Guard troops are being asked to stay in D.C.He said in a statement Thursday, “Speaker Pelosi continues to play politics behind closed doors regarding our security on Capitol Hill and lawmakers have been left in the dark for too long.”“Before any extension for National Guard presence is finalized, lawmakers should be briefed on the latest intelligence threat assessments to determine the necessity of keeping our servicemembers away from their families and fulltime jobs,” he said.“If more security is needed, it should by our Capitol Police with better planning and intelligence, not drawing from National Guardsmen and women that are needed for other missions such as vaccine distribution, natural disaster and overseas deployments,” he added.Some Democrats also expressed concern about the request.Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), a former intelligence and Pentagon official who revealed the request in a tweet on Thursday, tweeted that it was “critical” that Congress be briefed on decisions being made.“Whether an extension has been requested or the mission is indeed terminating on March 12, it’s critical that members of Congress get a briefing on what’s behind these decisions,” she said.Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.PoliticsCapitol PoliceElissa SlotkinJim InhofeMichael WaltzNational GuardPentagon.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
96,"The world still has no idea where and when the coronavirus pandemic began, according to scientists behind an open letter published Thurday calling for yet another World Health Organization (W.H.O.) investigation into the deadly pandemic.The two dozen scientists said Beijing had refused to provide key data samples to the investigation team, while pressure from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may have limited the scientific independence of the Chinese team that was part of the joint mission.“At this point we are no further advanced than we were a year ago,” Professor Nikolai Petrovsky, an expert in vaccines at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, and one of 26 global experts who signed the open letter as seen by Reuters.In January a W.H.O. investigative team visited hospitals, food markets and research institutes in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the coronavirus was identified, in search of clues.The mission became politically charged as it drew criticism for relying on CCP assistance and eschewing independence in favor of following strict Beijing guidelines.It began work a month after Wuhan declared itself free of the virus and any traces of its impact.Wuhan, China, party time! https://t.co/CEIZg2dhPo— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 21, 2020Team members later acknowledged China was reluctant to share vital data that could show coronavirus was circulating months earlier than first recognised.According to Reuters, the open letter said the W.H.O. mission “did not have the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation” into all theories about the origins of coronavirus.“All possibilities remain on the table and I have yet to see a single piece of independent scientific data that rules out any of them,” said Petrovsky.At a press briefing to mark the end of the W.H.O. visit to Wuhan, mission head Peter Ben Embarek appeared to dismiss theories the virus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan.But Petrovsky countered, saying it “doesn’t make any sense” to rule anything in or out, adding the aim of the open letter was “to get an acknowledgement globally that no one has yet identified the source of the virus and we need to keep searching.”“We need an open mind and if we close down some avenues because they are considered too sensitive, that is not how science operates,” he said.Former U.S. President Donald Trump led early criticism of China’s bungled handling of the pandemic, singling out the close alliance between the W.H.O. and China as an impediment to the global understanding of the viral threat:Calls for the investigation began as far back as April last year with China at first denying any culpability for the origins of coronavirus while ignoring calls for a full investigation.Then in May a leaked intelligence report by the Five Eyes — Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA — found the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had destroyed evidence on the outbreak of its virus, a result of which caused the “endangerment of other countries.”Even as the W.H.O. team wound up its visit to China earlier this year, Beijing was denying any responsibility for the outbreak and even pointed to the United States as a potential origin location despite no scientific evidence suggesting the possibility, as Breitbart News reported.AsiaLondon / EuropePoliticsChinaChinese Communist PartycoronavirusDonald TrumpWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
97,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980. After his speech, the Republican nominee won a standing ovation and the endorsement of the 35,000-member union. (AP Photo/Charles W. Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
98,"President Joe Biden spoke with President Alejandro Giammattei Falla of Guatemala promising to develop a “humane and effective” plan for migrants traveling from his country to the United States.“Both Presidents agreed for their respective teams to meet in the coming weeks to develop an effective and humane plan of action to manage migration,” a readout of the call sent to reporters read.Biden also expressed condolences for the 13 Guatemalan migrants who were shot and killed in Northern Mexico in January and had their bodies badly burned. A dozen state police officers in Mexico have been charged in the killings.President Biden also promised to help Guatemala by “combating corruption, promoting economic opportunity, and enhancing civilian security” which the White House described as the “root causes” of migration from Guatemala to the United States.Biden’s call with the Guatemala president proves he is willing to return migration back to normal, after canceling President Trump’s agreement with the country to require migrants to apply for asylum in their own countries.During his presidential campaign, Biden repeatedly blamed the United States for failing to help countries like Guatemala improve their economic conditions so few migrants would want to leave their country for the United States.A growing number of migrants from Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have resumed their journey north after President Biden vowed to roll back President Trump’s efforts to block migration into the country.In January, a caravan of an estimated 6,500 migrants began pushing through the Guatemalan southern border for the United States, according to Guatemala officials. ImmigrationPoliticsborderdiplomacyGuatemalaJoe BidenMexicoMigrant Crisis.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
100,"Several prominent Democrats expressed disappointment and frustration after several Democrats joined Republicans in the Senate in rejecting Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.While the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the $15 minimum wage hike could not be included in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure, Sanders, as well as his far-left allies, attempted to pave a way to make the hike a reality.Seven Democrats, as well as an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, joined Republicans in rejecting the effort on Friday.

101,"Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) is demanding an apology from Democrats and journalists who falsely claimed that he incited the Capitol riot with his speech at the “Save America Rally,” noting that evidence had shown the violence was pre-planned.Brooks gave what was described as a “fiery” speech on January 6:Brooks never called for violence, though he used strident language, such as “The 2020 election is behind us. Today is a time of choosing, and tomorrow is a time for fighting.”He said Americans would learn, by their votes on the Electoral College results, which Republicans preferred the perks of office to the principles of freedom. He never suggested disrupting the proceedings.Instead, he focused on the 2022 and 2024 elections, donning a cap that read “Fire Pelosi.” He added: “Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.”“Are you willing to do what it takes to fight for America?” he asked the crowd — referring, in context, to the next elections.Numerous media outlets and Democrats claimed that Brooks had encouraged violence, quoting his remarks out of context.In a statement Wednesday, Brooks said:As a former prosecutor, I understand the difference between speculation and evidence. Soon after the January 6 Capitol attack, I urged letting the investigations of the Capitol attack play out before drawing conclusions about what happened. The Fake News Media (looking to increase their ratings, readership, and profits), Socialist Democrats (looking to capitalize politically on the tragic events), and RINO ‘Surrender Caucus’ Republicans (looking to improve their past dismal showings in GOP primaries) refused to heed my advice. With a reckless disregard for the truth, they pushed the false narrative that demonstrators were whipped into a fervor by Save America Rally speeches at the Washington Mall Ellipse. They maliciously took statements out of context that I made in my Save America Rally speech and intentionally distorted them to make it seem like I encouraged violence. I did no such thing. President Donald Trump did no such thing.Media attacks on Brooks included the New York Times, who used Brooks’s “kicking ass” line to link hm to the Capitol riot. However, Brooks noted, they did not wait for the facts, which showed that the Capitol riot was pre-planned, and which have yet to produce any evidence that rioters were incited by a speech, or that they had links to any members of Congress.Brooks continued:The media and publishers have a duty to uncover and report the truth. In this instance they acted with a complete disregard for the truth by reporting scurrilous, slanderous and libelous accusations against myself and President Trump with no due diligence to uncover the truth, and with malice toward my good name. Federal investigations and Congressional committee hearing evidence establishes the Capitol attack was preplanned and coordinated. The attack was in no way, shape or form spontaneous. America now knows the Capitol attack was not caused by speeches at the Ellipse Save America Rally because the criminals who attacked the Capitol planned and prepared for them days and even weeks before the Ellipse speeches were even given. Any good faith examination of the facts related to the Capitol attack would have led one to quickly discover the attack was preplanned. Sworn law enforcement testimony and findings confirm just that.Democrats introduced a resolution to censure him, claiming that “his words helped spark chaos, destruction, injuries and death.” The Associated Press reported the story if the resolution had actually passed: “Mo Brooks won’t apologize despite resolution for his censure.”(The sponsor of that resolution, Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), is now under fire for allegedly conducting at least $671,000 worth of stock transactions without proper disclosures.)Now Brooks is demanding an apology, though he also says he does not expect one to be forthcoming. His statement continued:In order to restore my name against the malicious attacks, I demand that each and every Socialist Democrat, Fake News Media outlet, and RINO ‘Surrender Caucus’ Republican who sullied my good name by accusing me of inciting violence, publicly apologize and retract their statements. If any of these defamers are honorable and honest, they will do just that. However, for obvious reasons, I will not hold my breath awaiting their apology. Socialist Democrats, their Fake News Media allies, and RINO ‘Surrender Caucus’ Republicans must be held accountable for their defamation, slander and lies. The evidence is overwhelming and vindicates me and President Trump. The Capitol Attack was preplanned and coordinated by militant elements of various political groups. These were not peaceful protestors. No one saw the scale of the attack coming (not even the Capitol Police, with all of their intelligence resources). And, it was not the spontaneous result of my rousing political rally speech that occurred hours before and a mile and a half away, a speech, I might add, that contributed to the Alabama Republican Party recently honoring me with the title of a “rare true statesman.”During the Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, lawyers for the defense produced video evidence of Democrats using fiery, strident language identical to that used by Trump and other speakers at the “Save America Rally.”Joel B.

104,"The United States Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruled on Thursday that the burden of proof under federal immigration law falls on illegal aliens when they are trying to escape deportation.In a 5-3 decision, where Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself, a majority on the Court ruled in the case Pereida v. Wilkinson that it is incumbent on illegal aliens who are in deportation proceedings to prove they have not committed a crime of moral turpitude, thus making them eligible to avoid deportation.The case involved Clemente Avelino Pereida, an illegal alien from Mexico who has been in the U.S. since 1995 and has a wife and children — one of which is a U.S. citizen and another who is enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.Pereida was charged and convicted in Nebraska of criminal impersonation for providing a fraudulent Social Security Number to work illegally. The Department of Justice (DOJ) can provide relief from deportation for illegal aliens in cases where a crime of moral turpitude was not committed.Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority with Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice John Roberts, said Pereida had failed to prove he was not convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and thus was not eligible to avoid deportation.Gorsuch wrote:The INA expressly requires individuals seeking relief from lawful removal orders to prove all aspects of their eligibility. That includes proving they do not stand convicted of a disqualifying criminal offense. [Emphasis added]…Under the INA, certain nonpermanent aliens seeking to cancel a lawful removal order must prove that they have not been convicted of a disqualifying crime. The Eighth Circuit correctly held that Mr. Pereida failed to carry this burden. Its judgment is affirmed. [Emphasis added]Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan dissented in the case. For the dissent, Justice Breyer wrote that Pereida should be eligible to avoid deportation, arguing that criminal impersonation is not a crime of moral turpitude.“The relevant documents, in this case, do not show that the previous conviction at issue necessarily was for a crime involving moral turpitude,” Breyer wrote.The case is Pereida v.

106,"As the Senate prepares to debate the COVID-19 Relief bill, Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) observed the bill provides $400 billion that contains no protections for ensuring it will not be used to fund elective abortion.Daines tweeted a video of his review of some of the features of the measure, which passed the House Friday, referring to it as the “liberal wish list” of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY):.@JoeBiden, Pelosi and Schumer’s “COVID-19 relief package” is nothing more than a 628 page liberal wish list. Let’s dig in to some of Nancy Pelosi's greatest hits. It’s not pretty. pic.twitter.com/1azoepEIWX— Steve Daines (@SteveDaines) March 4, 2021“Here’s one that will get your blood pressure up,” said Daines, who heads the Senate Pro-Life Caucus. “$400 billion that has no protections to ensure we don’t have taxpayer dollars spent for abortions.”He explained Democrats removed the language of the Hyde Amendment that has prohibited taxpayer funding of abortions in appropriation bills.“$400 billion that could be used to fund abortions paid for by United States taxpayers,” the senator emphasized.In a floor speech in the House prior to the vote on the bill, co-chair of the House Pro-Life Caucus, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), also called the exclusion of the Hyde Amendment “a radical departure from all previous COVID-19 relief laws,” and one that “mandates taxpayer funding of abortion-on-demand.”As Catholic News Agency observed, GOP Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA), Virginia Foxx (NC), and Jackie Walorski (IN) attempted to insert an amendment with the Hyde Amendment language into the measure – one that was cosponsored by 206 House members.The House Rules Committee, however, refused to allow a vote on that amendment.Smith pointed out that Joe Biden once agreed that Americans should not be forced to pay for abortions:Mr. Biden once wrote to constituents explaining his support for laws against funding for abortion by saying it would “protect both the woman and her unborn child… I have consistently—on no fewer than 50 occasions—voted against federal funding of abortion” he said” … those of us who are opposed to abortion should not be compelled to pay for them.”I agree.In an op-ed at the Washington Times, Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action, also emphasized only nine percent of the bill’s funding is actually slated to address the public health issues related to the coronavirus pandemic.Additionally, almost half of the funding in the measure will be held back from distribution until 2022, at the earliest, a time when the pandemic could largely have already subsided.“A serious relief bill has devolved into a liberal wish list that, of course, funds the abortion industry,” McClusky asserted, explaining how taxpayers would foot the bill for the abortions of others:Several healthcare-related grants and subsidies in the legislation allow taxpayer dollars to subsidize and directly pay for abortions and healthcare plans covering abortion. These include, but are not limited to, rural healthcare grants, educational grants, funding for the Child Care Stabilization Fund, money allocated to COBRA healthcare plans, testing grants, and massive bailouts for failing state governments.McClusky noted that the “particularly problematic” portion of the bill lies in the Democrat-state bailouts, where $350 billion places no restrictions on states and localities from using taxpayer funds to pay for elective abortions.“Under the current guidelines, liberal states like New York and California, which are likely going to receive the lion’s share of the bailout, can funnel millions to abortion giants like Planned Parenthood if they choose,” he observed.Both the Hyde Amendment and the Helms Amendment, which has barred foreign policy expenses from financing abortion, are ignored in the COVID relief bill, McClusky said.“Taxpayer dollars allocated in the latest relief bill should be used to help American business owners struggling to keep their dreams alive,” he asserted. “The relief bill shouldn’t be used to exploit the crisis and double-down on extreme abortion policies that hurt the poor, marginalize women, and end innocent human life.”FaithHealthPoliticsabortion on demandChris Smithcoronavirus pandemicCOVID-19 reliefHelms AmendmentHyde AmendmentPlanned ParenthoodSteve Dainestaxpayer funding of abortionTom McClusky.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) to the proposed coronavirus relief package passed out of the House last week would ensure that stimulus checks are not awarded to illegal aliens living in the United States, Breitbart News has exclusively learned.Senate Democrats opened debate on the $1.9 trillion relief package without any GOP support, and it will need to go back to the House for approval if the Senate passes the legislation.Included in the package are $1,400 stimulus checks that currently could go to illegal aliens if not explicitly blocked. Cruz, in an amendment announced on Friday, is seeking to prevent illegal aliens from getting stimulus checks, which his office said would save American taxpayers nearly $8 billion.“Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants,” Cruz said in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” Cruz said. “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In the package’s current form, illegal aliens could secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

110,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) March 5, 2021Malinowski made about 90 financial trades in total, most of which were individual stocks, according to trade records his office disclosed.The congressman was mostly a buyer as the stock market tanked in March 2020 — 15 of the 22 trades the congressman said he made that month were purchases.Federal records indicated that Malinowski also made dozens of other stock trades during 2019 but failed to publicly disclose them within the legally required 30- to 45-day disclosure window — or ever file periodic transaction reports for them.Malinowski disclosed these 2019 stock trades in August as part of an annual personal financial-disclosure report that all members of Congress must file.Malinowski campaigned in 2019 on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics and increase transparency to ensure regular people — not corporations or special interests — have the strongest voices in Washington.”Since he entered Congress in 2019, Malinowski has sponsored several bills regarding financial transparency and political money. The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

112,"The Pentagon called the most recent rocket attacks on an Iraqi base where U.S. forces are stationed “a troubling development” but said there is no desire for escalation.“Certainly, this is a troubling development and not what anybody wanted to see, no question about it,” Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said about the attacks. He confirmed that an American contractor sheltering in place from the attacks suffered a heart attack and died.He said Iraqi authorities are investigating the attacks and said, “if there is a need to further respond, we will do that … in a manner of our own choosing.”He added, “Nobody wants to see the situation escalate.”The Biden administration may now be on the verge of a military tit-for-tat with Iranian-backed Shia militia in Iraq who have now conducted at least three rocket attacks on bases where U.S. troops and contractors are based.The first rocket attack came on February 15. Fourteen 107mm rockets launched at Erbil Air Base, killing one non-U.S. contractor and injuring nine, including an American service member and four American contractors.KRG are leading investigation. Further information will be released as it becomes available.— OIR Spokesman Col.

For updates see @SecMedCell https://t.co/7bx0qeRztn— OIR Spokesman Col. Wayne Marotto (@OIRSpox) February 22, 2021As pressure mounted on President Joe Biden to respond, the administration refrained from attributing the source of the attacks and said Iraqis were investigating them with assistance from the U.S.Three days later, on February 25, President Joe Biden authorized airstrikes in Syria, hitting nine structures that were being used by the Iran-backed Shia militia groups believed to have carried out the rocket attacks in Iraq.The Pentagon said the next day the airstrikes sent an “unambiguous, clear message to anyone in the region about what the stakes are if you’re going to continue to conduct attacks on our people.”The airstrikes were also meant to deter future attacks, Kirby said. He said:Our desire was to remove [the facilities] from their inventory and to send a strong message about future attacks. Clearly, we want there to be a deterrence message here delivered straight to them about the repercussions of going after our people and our Iraqi partners and our facilities inside Iraq. Now, we’ll have to see. But that was the intent.However, on March 3, there were more rocket attacks on an Iraqi base hosting U.S. troops.10 Indirect Fire rockets and Iraqi Security Forces are investigating.— OIR Spokesman Col. Wayne Marotto (@OIRSpox) March 3, 2021Kirby acknowledged the U.S. strikes were intended to send a signal about “how seriously we take our responsibilities to protect our people.”Although the Pentagon is not yet directly attributing the latest rocket attacks for the American contractor’s death, they raise the question of whether the Biden administration’s response was adequate and how it may now respond — particularly as it seeks to enter a nuclear negotiation with Iran.Politico reported that Biden chose the “middle option” from a broad range of military options.Republicans in Congress slammed Biden’s response as inadequate.“Iran did not get the message that harming Americans will have consequences. The mullahs in Tehran will not stop until they’re held directly responsible for American deaths at the hands of Iran-backed militias,” Rep. Mike Waltz, a National Guard colonel and Green Beret tweeted.Iran did not get the message that harming Americans will have consequences.

The Iranian regime seems intent on attacking Americans at the same time the Biden admin wants to give Tehran sanctions relief,” Hagarty tweeted.“Yesterday’s attack is an example of why it is crucial not to relieve sanctions pressure on the Iranian regime unless the regime ceases its terrorism and other threats to Americans,” he added.Yesterday’s attack is an example of why it is crucial not to relieve sanctions pressure on the Iranian regime unless the regime ceases its terrorism and other threats to Americans.— Senator Bill Hagerty (@SenatorHagerty) March 4, 2021Kirby said Wednesday he still hoped that the U.S. airstrikes would have a “deterrent effect” and declined to say what could come next.“Nobody wants to see this escalate into, as you described it, a tit-for-tat. That’s not in our interest. It’s not in the Iraqi people’s interest,” he said.Kirby avoided pointing the finger at who could be behind the rocket attacks but acknowledged that the rocket attacks “coincides with our past experience” with past attacks from Iranian-backed Shia militia groups, although he called them “Shia-backed militia.”Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.PoliticsAl AsadIranIran Nuclear DealIraqJohn KirbyPentagon.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
113,"The Democratic Socialists of America — an organization that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) belongs to — has called on Democrat New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign following claims by three women that he sexually harassed them.Cuomo, who is in his third term in office, is now getting pushback from people who share his leftist worldview but seemingly draw the line on sexual misconduct.The New York Post reported on the development:“In light of the multiple allegations of sexual harassment by Governor Cuomo, the NYC Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America is calling for the immediate resignation and impeachment of Governor Andrew Cuomo. We stand with Charlotte Bennet [sic], Lindsey Boylan, and Anna Ruch, who have spoken out about Governor Cuomo’s harassment,” the group said in a statement issued on Tuesday, referring to the three women who have spoken out.“Someone so comfortable with abusing his power should not be in leadership of our state,” the statement continued. “It is abundantly clear that Cuomo’s endemic pattern of abuse and bullying have disrupted and interfered with democratic processes in our state. The people of New York deserve better.”The DSA’s New York chapter issued the statement days after Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), whose district covers parts of the Bronx and Queens, called Boylan and Bennett’s accounts “extremely serious and painful to read,” and demanded an independent probe.Also this week the left-wing Working Families Party, which backed 2018 New York mayoral candidate Cynthia Nixon before backing Cuomo in the general election, also are calling for Cuomo to step down. A statement from the group read:Andrew Cuomo’s reign of fear, harassment, and intimidation cannot continue. We were horrified to learn of the Governor’s pattern of sexual harassment. We have been equally disturbed by the Governor’s response: he did not deny any of Charlotte Bennett’s specific allegations, failed to take any personal responsibility for his actions, and instead blamed his victims.We are calling on Governor Cuomo to resign immediately because he is unfit to serve the people of New York.The Post reported on others on the left who are calling for Cuomo to quit, including New York City Democrat Mayor Bill de Blasio, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-NY), and Democrat state Sens. Gustavo Rivera, Alessandra Biaggi, Jessica Ramos, and John Liu. State Assembly members Jessica González-Rojas, Ron Kim, and Tom Abinati also have turned against Cuomo.Cuomo has apologized but denies the claims and has not publicly indicated any intention of stepping down. Meanwhile on Thursday Cuomo announced he has hired an attorney to represent his executive office against charges that his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in high mortality rates in nursing homes, according to Reuters.Reuters also reported Cuomo has not hired a attorney for the sexual harassment claims.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comHealthPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-CortezAndrew Cuomobill deblasiocoronavirusDemocratic Socialists of AmericaNursing Homessexual harassmentWorking Families Party.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

C’mon guys,” she urged.The boys remained silent as another girl raised her hand to speak.“All right, looks like the women are the strong ones,” the first lady joked.The girl spoke about the importance of students learning not to be selfish and learning to control their actions by masking and social distancing to protect other people.Biden agreed.“It’s not just about your health,” she asked. “It’s about your neighbors, your teachers, those around you, we have to keep everybody safe and that’s why everybody has to mask, follow the protocols.”The first lady then interrupted a student to ask her what she was reading, to which she replied, “a book.”“A book,” Biden laughed. “OK.”She asked another student what she was reading and she showed her the cover of the book “The Fault in Our Stars.”“Oh yes,” Biden replied. “Gosh.

116,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

117,"A “porch pirate” bill making package theft a felony is headed to the Georgia Senate floor after passing the House on Wednesday.This week, a bill turning package theft from a misdemeanor to a felony flew through the Georgia House with a 101-67 vote. So-called “porch pirates” could face stiff penalties and even prison time for stolen deliveries.House Republican Rep. Bonnie Rich, one of the bill’s sponsors, celebrated the victory, saying it would “protect hard-working and law-abiding Georgians in their own homes.” In a Facebook post following the vote, Rich wrote:Answering the call from citizens across the state to take action against the proliferation of porch piracy, I worked with the United States Postal Inspector to craft state legislation that recognizes the brazen nature and mindset of a criminal who is willing to approach the door of a victim’s home and commit a crime.Not everyone is cheering, however. Critics say the potential consequences do not fit the crime. On Wednesday, Democrat Rep. Josh McLaurin tweeted a picture of himself and Rep. William K. Boddie Jr. with a message of resistance. “Will treasure this one. Rep. [Boddie] and I went to the well today to speak against excessive criminal penalties / ‘tough-on-crime’ posturing,” he wrote. “Proud to fight alongside my friend William.”After the bill passed on Thursday, McLaurin doubled down on his resistance — suggesting Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp should veto the bill if it makes its way to his desk. “Georgia shouldn’t be in the business of making new felonies to address annoyance or inconvenience,” McLaurin said. “It’s not in line with our state’s efforts at reform. If the Senate passes the porch piracy bill that just passed the House, [Kemp] should veto it. That conversation starts now.”Georgia Republicans are not the only ones making the case for a stronger response to package theft. In February, representatives for Tennessee and California made headlines for similar escalation.

Brian Jones said at the time, “we need to protect them.”CrimePoliticsPre-ViralBrian KempCaliforniaGeorgiaporch piratesTennesseeTheftUSPS.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
118,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
119,"Wisconsin Democrats are denouncing a GOP-authored state bill that would protect young Americans from the intrusion of transgender ideology into their sports and games.“When code words like ‘fairness’ and ‘leveling the playing field’ are brought forth in these bills, these are dog whistles for discrimination and exclusion,” Democratic Rep. Lee Snodgrass declared as she announced the Democrats’ opposition to the protection bill. She continued:We’ve learned under four years of ex-President Trump that when Republicans want to stir up their base, they seek forms of bigotry, stoke fear, and perpetuate false narratives about marginalized groups. When you are fed a steady diet of Fox News narratives, wedge issues, and other attacks [become] lazy fast lanes to the support for your cause.The Wisconsin “Protecting Women in Sports Act” bill was introduced on March 2 by GOP Rep. Barabra Dittrich. The GOP controls the state House and Senate, but the Democrats hold the governor’s office. A statement from Dittrich’s office said:Now, in a fractured, well-meaning attempt at inclusion, women’s achievements have once again been put at great risk of loss. Biological females are losing opportunities at titles, records, scholarships, and even participation. Additionally, by ignoring the scientific, biological fact that males have higher bone density, greater muscle mass, and often greater height, women are being put in physical danger of greater injury in competition …Parents and athletes throughout my legislative district who have devoted countless hours to supporting fair competition and athletic excellence have come to me asking, “Representative, what are you going to do about this?Amid Snodgrass’s invective, Dittrich has multiple independent polls, science, and health studies on her side:As the chair of the legislative LGBTQ caucus,  I am appalled at the legislation introduced by @RepDittrich today which seeks to prohibit transgender youth from participation in sports of their identified gender pic.twitter.com/KouxGa6wJ0— Rep. Lee Snodgrass (@RepSnodgrass) March 2, 2021Snodgrass argued that children will be victimized by the GOP effort to protect girls’ sports from males who declare themselves to be women:Just like the attempted bans prohibiting transgender folks from using the bathroom of their choice was not about bathrooms, proposed legislation prohibiting transgender youth from sports participation is not about sports. Bills like the ones introduced today not only discriminate against trans youth in ways that compromise their health, social and emotional development, and safety, they also raised a myriad of concerns about privacy.CDC data shows that 2 percent of high school students identify as transgender. Like their peers, these students have a variety of interests and passions, and they wish that they wish to pursue, including sports participation. And youth sports has shown to develop self-esteem, critical skills, and lifelong friendships, all things that trans youth should benefit from not being discriminated against experiencing.When code words like “fairness” and “leveling the playing field” are brought forth in these bills, these are dog whistles for discrimination and exclusion.While sports may be binary, for now, humans are not. We must allow students the respect of sports participation in the gender with which they identify.  Protection of emotional health and well-being of students does not stop when the bell rings and classes are over. It carries over to the courts, the fields, the tracks, and bills like this one that are being proposed today place minor children in harm’s way with false claims of inequality.We’ve learned under four years of ex-President Trump that when Republicans want to stir up their base, they seek forms of bigotry, stoke fear, and perpetuate false narratives about marginalized groups. When you are fed a steady diet of Fox News narratives, wedge issues, and other attacks [become] lazy fast lanes to the support for your cause.Trans youth matter. Trans lives matter. And yes, transgender participation in sports matter. Thank you.Snodgrass added in subsequent tweets:At her presser, Rep. Dittrich, wearing pearls no doubt for clutching, smiled as she pretended this legislation is about anything but codifying bigotry and discrimination, perpetuating false narratives and stoking fear. All this to leverage wedge issues to fire up a Trumpian base.If these bills do not die a rightful death in committee, they surely will be vetoed by @GovEvers, under whose leadership the Pride flag has flown for the first time in Wisconsin history.Snodgrass portrayed Dittrich’s sports-protection bill as a partisan jab, but the polls — and social-media comments — show that many Democratic voters favor the protections.“I am a Wisconsin resident and I support this bill,” tweeted activist Lauren Adams. “Many of us left-leaning women do, because Title IX is NOT a left/right issue! @senator_melissa and @Samba_Madison @RepSambaBaldeh I voted for you and I support this bill. It is not bigotry to have women’s sports.”GOP legislators have introduced popular bills in more than 20 states to protect girls’ sports.Deep-pocketed transgender groups, as well as the ACLU and other progressives, are lobbying and litigating against the child-protection bills.This is June Eastwood, a male athlete that identifies as female, winning the #NCAA  Big Sky Women's Championships.

120,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980.

Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
121,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
122,"H.R. 1, if enacted into law, would make American elections resemble those in the former Soviet Union, said Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), on Thursday’s edition of SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.Brooks said, “H.R. 1 is the worst piece of legislation relating to elections in the history of the United States of America. It does more to undermine our republic than any legislation I have ever seen or heard of, even looking back in the history books. By way of example, it registers 16- and 17-year-olds. It registers people automatically from multiple different sources like drivers licenses, social security cards, [or] any number of government sources.”“If you move from one address to another, you’re going to get registered twice,” he continued. “Someone like myself, if it’s Morris Jackson Brooks Jr. at one place, but Morris Jay Brooks Jr. at another, you get registered twice. Brooks warned that H.R. 1, named the For the People Act, will facilitate voter fraud if enacted as law.“It’s going to be massive voter fraud,” he held. “In short, the Democrats have ignored and undermined the Commission on Federal Election Reform report in 2005 — a bipartisan commission report by Jimmy Carter on the one hand and James Baker on the other hand — and have expanded the very worst of the things that the report said we needed to avoid.”LISTEN:Brooks stated, “If you’re talking about non-citizens voting in American elections. H.R. 1 is going to make it much easier, because it makes it a criminal offense for a poll worker to deny a non-citizen voting at the polls. That’s craziness, but that’s what they do with this legislation by tying the hands of our poll workers, who will be fearful of being prosecuted if they challenge a non-citizen who is trying to vote in an American election.”“On another level, the bipartisan report from 2005 says we need to minimize mass mail-out of [ballots], [and] minimize absentee voting, because that is where fraud is most likely to occur,” Brooks added. “What do the Democrats do? They expand it dramatically. The exact opposite of what we should be doing.”Brooks remarked, “There are dozens of provisions in this legislation that undermine the sacredness and the accuracy of the elections, and what we saw in a few places in the country in 2020 with the massive voter fraud that was occurring in those places would now become commonplace throughout the United States.”“In sum, the reliability the trustworthiness of American elections under H.R. 1 would be akin to those in the old Soviet Union, or in Cuba, or in Venezuela, or North Korea. Sure, you can vote, but your vote doesn’t count.”Marlow assessed, “It also makes a permanent Democrat majority. The Republicans would never win another election again if this gets passed.”“We don’t steal elections.

124,"President Joe Biden joked that Indian-American people were taking over the United States during a call with a NASA team on Thursday.Biden spoke about Indian-Americans as he talked with Dr. Swati Mohan, an Indian-American scientist who played a role in helping land a rover on Mars last week“It’s amazing. Indian of decent Americans are taking over the country,” Biden said. “You, my vice president, my speechwriter Vinay.”Vice President Kamala Harris’s mother immigrated to the United States from India. Biden’s speechwriter Vinay Reddy is also an Indian-American from Ohio.Biden has a history of awkward statements on the growing population of Indian-Americans.In 2006, Biden spoke about the rise of Indian immigrants in his state of Delaware.“In Delaware, the largest growth in population is Indian-Americans moving from India,” he said. “You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin’ Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent. I’m not joking.”During his call with the NASA team at the White House, Biden appeared to lose track of his instructions during the video call.“Am I supposed to speak now?” he asked, looking confused to a member of his staff during the call.NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory director Michael Watkins continued speaking as Biden looked around.“Now am I supposed to speak? Or is Swati supposed to say something? I was told I was supposed to speak with Swati,” he said.Watkins ultimately spoke to Biden, prompting the president to grin.“You restored a dose of confidence in the American people. They’re beginning to wonder about us,” Biden said.He praised the team for completing their mission, giving hope to the American people during the coronavirus pandemic.“You did it the most American way, you believed in science, you believed in hard work and you believed there wasn’t a darned thing you couldn’t do if you put your minds together,” he said.Biden recalled hearing a “head of state” who said that America was no longer able to do great things because of their failure to control the coronavirus.“We can land a rover on Mars, we can beat a pandemic, and with science, hope, and vision there’s not a damn thing we can’t do as a country,” he said.As he ended the call, Biden accepted an invitation to visit the NASA headquarters in person.“I’m like a poor relative, Mike.

Strong on Energy Independence, the Military, our great Vets and the Border, John has my Complete and Total Endorsement!– President Donald J.

He told Shannon Bream:I know that common sense isn’t legal in Washington, D.C. But I think a fair-minded rational person would ask Congress to vote to file a declaratory judgment action to ask the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of impeaching a president who isn’t president before we put the country through this. And I’ll just leave it at that and thank you for your time.”In August, Kennedy appeared on FNC’s Sunday Morning Futures to criticize President Joe Biden, calling him a “walking dead man politically, if you didn’t debate Trump.”This will be Trump’s third endorsement since leaving office. As the 2022 midterms are taking shape, Trump began screening candidates who are eager to continue his MAGA policies and keep the “America First” agenda.Trump has received dozens of requests from prospective candidates who wish to earn his support, and he is fielding them as he sees fit. Trump has rejected meetings with former South Carolina governor and 2024 hopeful Nikki Haley and with some House and Senate GOP candidates vying for his ear.Formal meetings with prospects could begin as early as March, according to a report. Trump has refocused on the movement he began, now that the Senate impeachment trial fully acquitted him, leading the America First agenda into battle against the “business as usual” crowd in Washington, DC.

126,"A recent poll conducted by WPA Intelligence showing Josh Mandel leads the Ohio Republican Senate primary with 38 percent, a 27 point lead over his closest competitor.Josh Mandel is the former Ohio state treasurer and a GOP candidate for U.S. Senate next year. The current Senator, Rob Portman (R-OH), announced that he would retire at the end of his term.The poll was conducted on behalf of the Club for Growth PAC in Ohio from February 1-3. The poll shows Mandel is the front runner for a hypothetical Senate primary, receiving 38 percent of the vote. Rep. Steve Stivers (R-OH) is in second place with just 11 percent of the vote. There are three other likely candidates in the single digits, and 39 percent of the voters still undecided.Early polling is likely based significantly on the name ID. Mandel has previously appeared on a statewide ballot in three different elections.WPA Intelligence asked 509 likely Republican primary voters in Ohio. All of the interviews were conducted by live telephone. The methodology shows the “sample was selected from the Ohio voter file and stratified by geography, age, gender, and vote history to ensure a representative sample of the likely primary electorate. The survey has a margin of error of +4.4% at the 95% confidence level.”In January, Mandel spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle about what Ohio needs right now. Mandel explained: “I think the key is keeping the Trump coalition together. I feel very strongly that the Trump coalition is made up of working people, not country club Republicans, and I think the whole country club Republican set, the establishment Republicans, the Harvard elite, they look down on the people of Ohio.

134,"The number of migrant youth daily referred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for release into the United States has surged nearly 600 percent since President Trump was in office, newly released data reveals.Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs), as Breitbart News has extensively reported, apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border have increased tremendously over the last month, where now federal shelters are estimated to be at 93 percent capacity. The UAC program takes migrant youth and places them into HHS custody until they are released to a sponsor in the U.S.Likewise, President Joe Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has continued holding UACs in federal facilities originally intended for adult border crossers despite legal requirements that the migrant youth be turned over to HHS within 72 hours, Breitbart News exclusively reported.Data released on Thursday reveals the extent to which the Biden administration has increased the UAC pipeline into the U.S. as a result of ending the Remain in Mexico policy, canceling cooperative asylum agreements with Central America, and restarting the Catch and Release process.The data finds that in the first week of January, when the Trump administration still had controls in place at the southern border, DHS officials were referring about 47 UACs to HHS every day. Today, DHS officials are referring about 321 UACs to HHS every day — a more than 580 percent increase.At the same time, HHS is boosting its release of UACs to sponsors. The data shows that while about 90 UACs a week were released to sponsors in the U.S. by HHS in late January, today an average of 174 UACs are being released every day by HHS.The data comes as the Biden administration seeks to transform controls at the U.S.-Mexico border into rapid processing sites where border crossers and migrants are quickly processed by federal immigration officials and then released into the nation’s interior.To alleviate the appearance of a surge of illegal immigration at the southern border, Breitbart News exclusively reported, the Biden administration is looking to release border crossers further into the U.S. interior rather than the standard where releases occur in U.S. border communities.The Biden administration is expecting to massively expand the UAC pipeline into the U.S. by an increase of at least 290 percent over this year. In 2020, about 30,000 UACs arrived at the southern border, but administration officials estimate they will welcome about 117,000 UACs this year.More than 87 percent of UACs in HHS custody are between 13 and 17-years-old, while more than 71 percent are boys. The most common destinations for UACs are in Harris County, Texas; Dallas County, Texas; Davidson County, Tennessee; Queens County, New York; Suffolk County, New York; Kings County, New York; Prince George’s County, Maryland; Palm Beach County, Florida; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Los Angeles County, California.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

139,"Rep. Elaine Luria (D-VA) flip-flopped on her national minimum wage position after saying an increase would hurt small businesses on the campaign trail.As a candidate, Luria (pictured) opposed changing the federal minimum wage, saying it “could cause risk” to small businesses, while favoring a localized minimum wage hike.At a candidate’s forum in May 2018, Luria argued against an immediate rise in the minimum wage, warning it “could cause risk to my business and other businesses.” Luria further explained, “A gradual raise in the minimum wage indexed with inflation is essential, we need to look at that based off of different areas of the country that have different costs of living.”Despite her campaign position, in 2019, the newly sworn-in congresswoman became an original co-sponsor of fellow Virginia Democrat Bobby Scott’s legislation to raise the minimum wage. The Raise the Wage Act was a Pelosi-backed bill to increase the hourly minimum wage from $7.25  to $15 nationwide, regardless of the local cost of living.In January, Luria was again an original co-sponsor of the Raise the Wage Act. The bill’s Senate counterpart was introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).In 2019, Luria opted against supporting fellow Democrat Rep. Terri Sewell’s (D-AL) PHASE-in $15 Wage Act. According to Sewell’s press release, the bill “would allow the entire country to meet and exceed a $15 minimum wage, but at different times depending on how quickly an area can absorb the wage increase.”A Congressional Budgeting Office (CBO) report found that the wage hike would “lift some families out of poverty” but “other low-wage workers would become jobless”:For most low-wage workers, earnings and family income would increase, which would lift some families out of poverty. But other low-wage workers would become jobless, and their family income would fall—in some cases, below the poverty threshold.The bill would also phase out the lower minimum wage option applied to teenagers during their first 90 days with a new employer, as well as a lower minimum wage for persons with disabilities.EconomyPoliticsBobby ScottCongressional Budget Office (CBO)Elaine Luriaminimum wageRaise the Wage ActTerri SewellVirginia.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

The act essentially strips states of their power in conducting federal elections by imposing limits on how states maintain their voter registration rolls and overriding state ID laws.“Additionally, the Act’s regulation of congressional elections, including by mandating mail-in voting, requiring states to accept late ballots, overriding state voter identification (“ID”) laws, and mandating that states conduct redistricting through unelected commissions, also faces severe constitutional hurdles,” they warned, identifying the act’s limitations on voter ID laws as “perhaps” the “most egregious” portion of the measure.Ultimately, state leaders said the act takes “a one-sided approach to governing and usurps states’ authority over elections” — a fact they believe will not instill confidence in the elections moving forward.“Around the nation, the 2020 general elections generated mass confusion and distrust—problems that the Act would only exacerbate,” they wrote, warning that they will “seek legal remedies to protect the Constitution, the sovereignty of all states, our elections, and the rights of our citizens,” in the event of the bill becoming law.PoliticsFor the People ActH.R. 1Steve Scalise.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
141,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

142,"Democrats have postponed a floor vote on President Joe Biden’s massive amnesty and population-expansion bill because of “dismal” support among Democrats, according to Politico.Instead of a March vote, Democrats say their huge bill will be sent through the committees while supporters try to build support in time for an April vote, according to Politico, which added:Proponents of the Biden bill, meanwhile, are still furiously working the phones to get their colleagues on board. That group, led by California Reps. Linda Sánchez, Judy Chu and Zoe Lofgren, has also lined up meetings with influential groups across the caucus, including the Blue Dogs on Tuesday and progressives on Thursday. Sánchez and Lofgren, along with other top Democrats, also spoke to the New Democrat Coalition late last month.Democrats in swing districts are looking to make some changes to the bill, Politico reported. One token change in favor of the E-Verify employment system was suggested by Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ):“Yes, I support what’s in the bill. I think we would be in a stronger position to get it enacted if we eventually ended up where, I think, the middle ground is,” Malinowski said. “I think for both solid political, practical reasons and moral reasons, those two things should go together.”In the meantime, Democrats will try to pass two other major amnesty bills as soon as next week.One bill would amnesty more than two million migrants brought to the United States as children. Some GOP members are expected to support the bill.The second bill would amnesty one million illegal migrants who were hired by the U.S. agriculture sector. The bill would also allow farm companies to import many more cheap temporary workers that would sideline local Americans, reduce corporate spending on high-tech labor-saving machines, and shrink payrolls and tax receipts in many rural towns. The agriculture sector amnesty may win support from more than 20 Republicans.Biden’s bigger bill would amnesty at least 11 million people and then deliver roughly 24 million additional people to Americans’ national labor market, their housing markets, schools, and colleges.The huge population expansion would force up real estate prices and rents and push many blue-collar Americans out of expensive cities.The bill would also sideline American graduates by allowing Fortune 500 companies to hire an unlimited number of foreign graduates, put them to work for 10 years, and pay them with slices of Americans’ citizenship.The Biden bill would also put several million migrants on a fast track to the voting booths in 2024.The Politico article also noted that Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us advocacy group is conducting polls to persuade Democrats that it is safe to go back into the amnesty waters:During a session at the House Democratic Caucus’s virtual retreat on Wednesday, advocates shared new polling conducted for the immigrant rights groups FWD.us and America’s Voice, which showed that 63 percent of voters would be “upset” if protections for undocumented immigrants didn’t pass. The online survey of 1,200 voters who participated in the 2020 election was conducted Feb. 20-26.After the Senate Democrats passed the 2013 “Gang of Eight” amnesty in 2013, they lost five seats in the 2014 Senate elections — and nudged Donald Trump toward a White Hosue run in 2016.In reality, amnesty and labor migration are deeply unpopular outside the Democrats’ base of white progressives and college graduates.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.Biden's DHS opens the 'OPT' door wider for many foreign college graduates to take starter jobs & careers from new US graduates. That's a reversal from Trump, when his deputies quietly tried to help American grads get the jobs.  #H1B, #OPThttps://t.co/Y3o9PIgpTj— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 4, 2021 EconomyImmigrationPoliticsagricultureAmnestyDACAe-verifyFWD.usGang of Eight amnestygreen card giveawayPopulation.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
143,"House Democrats passed H.R. 1, the so-called “For the People Act,” on Wednesday.

144,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

148,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep.

Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980. After his speech, the Republican nominee won a standing ovation and the endorsement of the 35,000-member union. (AP Photo/Charles W. Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

150,"Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R), under pressure from Democrats and President Joe Biden, held a press conference Thursday and announced she will extend the statewide coronavirus mask mandate for five weeks.“As of Tuesday, Alabama’s seven-day average for new COVID-19 cases was 778 cases per day,” Ivey told the small crowd gathered to hear her remarks at the state Capitol. “That’s an 82 percent drop from the high reached on January 10 and the lowest new average for daily cases since June. … We are definitely in the indication that we are moving in the right direction.”She added:Even with this positive news, however, both Dr. Harris and I are both convinced that we need to get past Easter and hopefully allow more Alabamians to get their first shot before we take a first step that some states have taken to remove the mask order altogether and other restrictions. We’re not there yet, but goodness knows, we’re getting closer.Ivey had previously extended the state’s safer at home” order, which included a mask mandate, in January. That extension was set to expire on Friday, but under pressure from health officials and Democrats in the state, Ivey extended the order.According to Ivey, the “new modified order” will ease up restrictions and “keep our mask order in place for another five weeks through April 9. But let me be abundantly clear: after April 9, I will not keep the mask order in effect.”Ivey’s announcement comes one day after President Biden criticized the governors of Mississippi and Texas for lifting their statewide mask mandates, describing it as “neanderthal thinking.”Ivey also stated she has “respect” for those who believe imposing a mask mandate on residents in the state is a “step too far in government overreach.”Ivey’s decision to give in to Democrat demands comes after she was planning to scrap the mandate this week. Sources with knowledge of the matter told Breitbart News Wednesday she was going to get rid of it, and Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth issued a statement calling on Ivey to eliminate it now. Nonetheless, Ivey’s decision to extend it only until April 9 — and her pledge to never extend it again under any circumstances beyond that point — is a sort of a win for conservative critics of the mask mandates, as that date still falls within Biden’s first 100 days. This means Alabama will join other states in flouting the new president’s recommendations.Ivey said at the press conference summer camps will be allowed to resume normal operations this year. She also stated she is “going to lift restrictions on seating limits at restaurants.”Ivey said she will be “raising the number of visitors of caregivers from 1 to 2 to accompany their loved one during a stay at a hospital or nursing home.”Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.HealthPoliticsScienceAlabamacoronavirusCOVID-19Face MasksKay Ivey.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
151,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

All ladies deemed worth of the honor by the gentlemen receive 10 points for every signature at the end of the day. The New York Post reported on the criticism that led to the lesson being nixed:Male students were also reportedly given advisories — including referring to girls as “milady” and showing “courtly courtesy as they assist ladies who may have dropped an article by picking it up for them,” according to a subsequent tweet.Boys were also told not to use vulgarity or complain and to rise when females entered or exited a room.Twitter reactions varied — with some speculating that the assignments were supposed to demonstrate regressive gender roles of the period. But most respondents found the material unacceptable no matter the intent. The school eventually canceled the concept outright.“This assignment has been reviewed, and despite its historical context, it does not reflect our district and community values,” Dr. Anita Herbert, superintendent of the local district told Fox News. “The matter has been addressed with the teacher, and the assignment was removed.”Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comEducationPoliticschivalrycourtingDatinggentlemenladiesMedievalschool curriculumTexas.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
157,"Democrats voted against his amendment to the proposed coronavirus relief package that would have stopped American taxpayers’ money from going to illegal aliens in $1,400 stimulus checks, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Saturday.Sen. Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall. As a result, more Americans would be cut off from payments,” the article concluded.ImmigrationPoliticsPre-ViralcoronavirusIllegal Aliensstimulus checksTed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Every business that wants to be open should be open,” he said.President Biden sharply criticized the decision, accusing Abbott of engaging in “Neanderthal” thinking.“The last thing — the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that, in the meantime, everything is fine, take off your mask,” Biden said. White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended his remark on Thursday.“How does comparing someone to a Neanderthal help convince them to change course and get on board with your public health message?” a reporter asked, prompting Psaki to emphasize the word “behavior.”“The behavior of a Neanderthal, just to be very clear,” Psaki said. “The behavior of.”Florida has also remained open under Gov.

159,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate.

160,"Alabama state legislatures voted 23-4 to pass legislation protecting minors from life-altering hormone treatments and “gender reassignment” surgery — actions embraced by transgender activists who consider gender a choice not a biological fact.Republican State Senator Shay Shelnutt sponsored the legislation.“Children aren’t mature enough to make these decisions on surgeries and drugs,” Shelnutt said. “The whole point is to protect kids.”The Daily Wire reported on the development:Democrats and pro-transgender activists were reportedly outraged by the passage of the bill. When faced with the criticism that Republicans were “infringing” on the ability of people to make their own decisions, Shelnutt noted that the state bans minors from other substances, like alcohol and tobacco. The report quoted Biden’s executive order, specifically drawing attention to how it “mandated allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports.” The order stated, in part:Every person should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear, no matter who they are or whom they love. Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports. Adults should be able to earn a living and pursue a vocation knowing that they will not be fired, demoted, or mistreated because of whom they go home to or because how they dress does not conform to sex-based stereotypes. People should be able to access healthcare and secure a roof over their heads without being subjected to sex discrimination.“All persons should receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation,” the order continued.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comHealthPoliticsScienceAlabamaGender Reassignment Surgeryhormone therapyminorsstate lawmakersTransgender.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
161,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

Spencer Cox currently has no plans to do the same, under pressure from President Joe Biden and Democrats.Asked by Breitbart News whether Gov. Cox had plans to lift the statewide mask mandate or ease restrictions put in place following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Jennifer Napier-Pearce, adviser and director of communications for Gov. Cox, said, “Not at this time.”“Gov. Cox and state health experts developed a plan to reduce restrictions based on infection rates, hospitalizations, and percent positivity,” Napier-Pearce added.Earlier this week, Texas Gov.

163,"Appearing Thursday on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) tampered down expectations of mounting a possible campaign for the White House in 2024.A partial transcript is as follows: HUGH HEWITT: So Congressman, before I go to your anti-lockdown act, which is overdue and very timely, and I want to talk about it, Mike Pompeo got asked by Sean Hannity last night if he’s running in 2024. So I’ve got to ask you. Have you ruled out a presidential run in 2024?CRENSHAW: I’d say yeah, pretty much. It doesn’t seem very tempting.HEWITT: You’re kidding me. People are expecting you to run.CRENSHAW: Yeah. I don’t think so. I don’t know. It’s not tempting. It’s also four years away. I don’t think, I think we’re tripping all over ourselves trying to figure out who’s going to be on the ticket in four years. And it’s a lot, a lot…HEWITT: Do you know why that is? It has the feel, Congressman, of an end, it has the feel of W. after two terms and Obama after two terms where you know that the incumbent won’t be in the race. And so the race starts very early, because you’re not running against an incumbent with the uphill that it matters. It’s not 2012, and it’s not 2004. People assume Joe Biden won’t be running again. That’s why there’s speculation.CRENSHAW: Yeah, that’s a pretty fair assessment. You know, I think there could still be speculation, but I think you’re right. I mean, I think Joe Biden would probably agree with you, too. It certainly seems that way. You know, I just don’t put a bunch of thought into it. We’re all getting asked this a lot, like who’s the leader now, who do we follow. Follow yourself.HEWITT: Yeah, I always frame it this way. Have you ruled it out? Because if you’ve ruled it out, that’s great, and if you haven’t ruled it out, that’s fine, too, but it keeps people without saying who’s the leader, because I think it’s silly to predict leaders at this point. I mean, a meteor could hit the United States by 2024.REP. CRENSHAW: Yeah. Well, right, but you see a lot of people, like, is Trump still the leader. I mean, that’s the real question, right? Is Trump still the leader? And I say well, I mean not technically, no. Who’s the leader of the Democrats before Biden was president? Was it Pelosi? Was it Schumer? You know, it’s not clear. It’s not meant to be clear. I think there’s a lot of pushing and pulling from either side of the party. And I think everybody needs to chill just a little bit and let it happen as it will, because then something will emerge.

164,"House Speaker Pelosi (D-CA) on Thursday celebrated the House passing H.R. 1, which the GOP warns will federalize state elections and lead to greater distrust in the U.S. election system, branding it as key to curbing “misinformation” on Democrat priorities such as climate change and gun control.“We are so pleased with the actions taken by the House of Representatives last night,” Pelosi told reporters at her Thursday press conference, stating that lawmakers made a “giant step for democracy.”The Speaker claimed that the legislation will “protect the right to vote” by removing “obstacles of participation” — a likely reference to the measure’s federal takeover of state voting procedures, particularly overriding state voter ID laws.“H.R. 1, For the People, the first 300 pages were written by John Lewis to remove voter suppression tactics from our political system. Some of the rest of it was written to protect the integrity of our electoral system, the physical infrastructure of our elections,” Pelosi said, contending that the measure reduces the role of special interest money — something she seems to believe will help advance her party’s initiatives, from climate change to gun control:What’s exciting about it is it restores confidence that people have that their vote and their voice is as important as anyone’s. That yes. We can address the climate crisis if big, dark special interest money is not suffocating the airwaves with misinformation about how to protect the planet. We yes can have background checks passed in the whole Congress of the United States to protect our children if big, dark special interest gun lobbying money is not sucffucoating the airwaves. And yes, we can have lower cost of prescription drugs. The list goes on and on. We can ‘Build Back Better’ for the people in every zip code as we said in our caucus yesterday.Countless Republicans have warned against H.R. 1 due to the impact it would have on states and their primary role in conducting federal elections for House and Senate and presidential elections. Twenty state attorneys general sent a letter to House and Senate leadership prior to the measure’s passing, highlighting the bill’s many “vulnerabilities” and constitutional red flags.As Breitbart News reported:H.R. 1, they continued, “implicates the Electors Clause” by regulating the elections for president and vice president. The state leaders also highlighted the “severe constitutional hurdles” the measure faces due to its “regulation of congressional elections, including by mandating mail-in voting, requiring states to accept late ballots, overriding state voter identification (“ID”) laws, and mandating that states conduct redistricting through unelected commissions.”The attorneys general identified the measure’s limitations on voter ID laws as, perhaps, the most “egregious” portion of the act, noting that a majority of states have some form of a voter ID law.The state leaders warned that they will “seek legal remedies to protect the Constitution, the sovereignty of all states, our elections, and the rights of our citizens” if the bill does, in fact, become law.Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) is among GOP lawmakers who spoke most forcefully against the bill following its passage, stating that Americans should be “outraged” by House Democrats passing the proposal:Every single American should be OUTRAGED by this:Democrats just voted to ban voter ID nationwide and force every state to permanently expand mail-in voting.— Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) March 4, 2021PoliticsFor the People ActH.R. 1Nancy PelosiSteve Scalise.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
165,"Twenty attorneys general signed a letter addressed to House and Senate leaders pleading against H.R. 1, which the Democrat-led House passed on party lines late Wednesday evening, deeming it unconstitutional as it sets what they described as “alarming mandates,” leading to the federalization of state elections.The House passed H.R. 1, of the “For the People Act of 2021,” Wednesday night, earning praise from Democrats across the board. Hours prior to its passage, 20 attorneys general, led by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita (R), sent a letter addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). H.R. 1 “betrays several Constitutional deficiencies and alarming mandates that, if passed, would federalize state elections and impose burdensome costs and regulations on state and local officials,” they wrote, detailing the Elections Clause of Article I of the Constitution and the Electors Clause of Article II, which gives states the primary role in conducting federal elections for House and Senate, and an even bigger role in presidential elections.“The Act would invert that constitutional structure, commandeer state resources, confuse and muddle elections procedures, and erode faith in our elections and systems of governance,” the attorneys general wrote, asking lawmakers to consider the measure’s many “vulnerabilities.”H.R. 1, they continued, “implicates the Electors Clause” by regulating the elections for president and vice president. The state leaders also highlighted the “severe constitutional hurdles” the measure faces due to its “regulation of congressional elections, including by mandating mail-in voting, requiring states to accept late ballots, overriding state voter identification (“ID”) laws, and mandating that states conduct redistricting through unelected commissions.”The attorneys general identified the measure’s limitations on voter ID laws as, perhaps, the most “egregious” portion of the act, noting that a majority of states have some form of a voter ID law:Yet the Act would dismantle meaningful voter ID laws by allowing a statement, as a substitute for prior-issued, document-backed identification, to “attest[] to the individual’s identity and . . . that the individual is eligible to vote in the election.” This does little to ensure that voters are who they say they are. Worse, it vitiates the capacity of voter ID requirements to protect against improper interference with voting rights. Before the advent of voter ID laws, partisans stationed at polling places could challenge voters based only on suspicions about identity, a process that prompted concerns about voter intimidation. Robust voter ID laws, however, require all voters to present photo identification, i.e., objective, on-the-spot confirmation of the right to vote that immediately refutes bad-faith challenges based on vaguely articulated suspicions. Fair election laws treat all voters equally. By that standard, the Act is not a fair election law.The state leaders also highlighted the potential issues with nationwide automatic voter registration, limitations on how states manage their voter rolls, and the call for states to “undertake congressional redistricting by way of so-called ‘independent’ commissions.”Overall, the act “takes a one-sided approach to governing and usurps states’ authority over elections,” the letter read:With confidence in elections at a record low, the country’s focus should be on building trust in the electoral process. Around the nation, the 2020 general elections generated mass confusion and distrust—problems that the Act would only exacerbate. Should the Act become law, we will seek legal remedies to protect the Constitution, the sovereignty of all states, our elections, and the rights of our citizens.Signers include the attorney general from several states, including Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia.PoliticsAttorney GeneralFor the People ActH.R. 1Todd Rokita.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
166,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

167,"The Arizona Department of Education wants its teachers to promote racial “equity and diversity” through an “anti-racist” program that promotes the idea that white babies and toddlers are racist.Provided for teachers is an “equity and diversity” toolkit. Included in this toolkit, is the wild-eyed insanity that your white baby is racist.Look at this garbage…SCOOP: The Arizona Department of Education has created an ""equity"" toolkit claiming that babies show the first signs of racism at three months old and that white children ""remain strongly biased in favor of whiteness"" by age five. Let's review the resources in the toolkit.  pic.twitter.com/g4Sk6X0VuO— Christopher F. Rufo ⚔️ (@realchrisrufo) March 2, 2021And this naked racism is aimed directly at white parents.For example, one recommended piece of reading linked in the toolkit is titled “How White Parents Can Talk to Their Kids About Race.” It says, “White parents should begin addressing issues of race and racism early, even before their children can speak. Studies have indicated that infants as young as 3 months old can recognize racial differences.”It warns, “Avoiding the topic rather than actively countering it with anti-racist attitudes and actions, simply opens the door for children to absorb bias from the world around them.”For babies aged  — no joke — 0-2, this same article stresses that “White parents should make sure that their children see them interact in close, warm, intimate, trusting, and caring relationships with individuals whose race and ethnicity differs from their own.”Additionally, there’s the “importance of creating a home environment that challenges broader societal messages privileging whiteness, whether it’s through board books with characters of color, artwork in the house or even the people invited over.”This sounds like satire, but it’s not a joke. This is what the Arizona Department of Education wants you to teach babies and children. But only white babies and children. For it is white babies who are the problem — white babies and white toddlers and white parents.So what we have here is the Arizona Department of Education teaching and spreading blatant racism, teaching children that whites are so awful and evil, unless there’s a concerted intervention, their babies and toddlers will grow up racist.Naturally, another piece of recommended reading in the toolkit is “Why Teaching Black Lives Matter Matters,” which means “teaching second-graders about Black Lives Matter.”So Arizona wants its teachers teaching second-graders that Black Lives Matter, a full-blown domestic terrorist group, is a good and noble thing.Listen up… You have to homeschool. This evil racism is not going away.

168,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
169,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980.

Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
170,"ORLANDO, Florida — Democrats seek to use language to control the narrative and shape perception — something they have done in pushing their radical proposals, from H.R. 1 to the Equality Act — Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) warned during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Saturday.Appearing at CPAC, Boebert spoke about the Democrats’ radical policy proposals — from the Equality Act, which passed in the House last week, to H.R. 1, which passed in the House Wednesday evening. At the root of these proposals is the Democrats’ grander attempt, she said, to use language to control the narrative and shape perception.“If they control then language, they control the narrative. And if they control the narrative, they control perception, and right now in America, it seems that perception is reality,” she said, stressing that it is up to the Senate to hold the line as the House continues to advance House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) radical proposals, such as the Equality Act, which she forcefully stood against in a fiery floor speech last week.“Democrats truly have traded the truth for a lie. The truth is, there are two genders. You can’t just make up how many genders we have. … This Equality Act who is it equal for? Who is it providing equality to? Certainly not women. I’m a woman. I have five nieces, and what about my nieces who now have to look behind their backs to make sure that there isn’t some confused man creeping in the bathroom trying to catch a peek at them?” she asked.“Is it equal for the parents who are at risk of having their child taken from their custody because they refuse to inject their child with hormone blockers?” she asked, explaining that she is “tired” of Republicans remaining on defense on the issue.“Is that really what they [Democrats] want? They want our children to mutilate their bodies before they’re even adults and make these harsh life-altering decisions? We need to go on offense about this. There Equality Act is not equal for any American in the United States,” she said.H.R. 1, which she dubbed the “For the Swamp Act,” is another radical proposal that must be stopped, Boebert insisted.
“We have H.R. 1 and the Democrats, they call this the ‘For the People Act.’ No. It’s the ‘For the Swamp Act.’ This is something that will federalize our elections. It’s a D.C. takeover of our elections,” Boebert explained. “This goes right back to them controlling the language. They act like it’s something that’s great for you.  … They act like all of these things are wonderful for the American people, and they’re not.”“Pretty much, if the title of a bill sounds wonderful, run. Run, it’s terrible,” she explained. “But the ‘For the People Act,’ ‘For the Swamp Act,’ you know, this actually has tax dollars that will pay for politicians’ campaigns. It’s disgusting. No tax dollar should go to a campaign.”Pelosi and the Democrats, she said, are making “terrible decisions,” and it is “time the American people take a stand and take our country back.”“We need the Senate to hold the line, and the Senate is America’s hope right now, so we need people all over contacting their senators, calling them. Those phone calls matter. The letters matter. We have logs of who calls in, and it makes a difference when those numbers start to grow on certain topics. So we need people engaged,” she added.The Colorado congresswoman also criticized the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal overwhelmingly backed by Democrats, noting that, once again, Democrats are using language to “make Republicans just look like mean, bad people.”“But we know that there’s still $1 trillion that’s already been passed and approved that’s unspent. Let’s spend that $1 trillion before loading up a brand new bill full of pork,” she said, asking why art institutions are getting “millions of dollars when the Americans people are sitting at home waiting on a $1,400 check.”“Progressives are incentivizing Americans to vote for Democrats because they think they’re someone going to get some sort of bonus from it. Maybe $2,000 checks,” she said. “Well, no. We’re getting a president who’s bringing us back into endless wars, and just making money out of thin air.”PoliticsCPACFor the People ActH.R. 1Lauren BoebertOn the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
171,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
172,"A report released last month by the Empire Center for Public Policy undermines claims by the New York State Department of Health that Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D-NY) controversial March 25 order requiring nursing homes in the state to admit coronavirus-positive residents had no impact on nursing home coronavirus death rates.In that report, titled, “COVID-positive Admissions Were Correlated with Higher Death Rates in New York Nursing Homes,” the Albany, New York, based think tank concluded, “The admission of coronavirus-positive patients into New York nursing homes under March 25 guidance from the New York State Department of Health was associated with a statistically significant increase in resident deaths.”Cuomo’s controversial March 25, 2020, guidance was in effect until May 10, 2020.“Statewide, the findings imply that COVID-positive new admissions between late March and early May, which numbered 6,327, were associated with several hundred and possibly more than 1,000 additional resident deaths,” (emphasis added) the Empire Center study found .Cuomo’s policy was particularly damaging in upstate New York nursing homes, the study noted:The effect [of Cuomo’s March 25, 2020 guidance] was more pronounced upstate—possibly because the pandemic was less severe in that region at the time, so that even a single exposure would have had a larger impact on the level of risk.Among nursing homes outside of New York City and its suburbs, each positive admission was associated with 0.62 additional deaths (MOE plus or minus 0.17), and any number of positive admissions was associated with 9.33 additional deaths per facility (MOE plus or minus 2.6).Also in the upstate region, facilities that admitted at least one positive patient during this period accounted for 82 percent of coronavirus deaths among nursing home residents, even though they had only 32 percent of the residents.“I do think that this policy [implemented on March 25, 2020 by the Cuomo administration] made things worse. It was a bad situation to begin with. It was going to take an awful lot of lives regardless,” Bill Hammond, co-author of the report and a Senior Fellow for Health Policy at the Empire Center for Public Policy told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Wednesday.“It sure seems to be politically motivated,” Hammond said of Gov. Cuomo’s efforts to withhold nursing home COVID-19 death data, an effort that was stymied on January 28 when New York Attorney General Letitia James dropped a bombshell report “which found Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration had ‘undercounted’ the number of coronavirus-related deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50 percent.”Then in February, a judge ordered the New York State Department of Health to release nursing home data requested by the Empire Center for Public Policy in a Freedom of Information Act request.“He’s defensive on this. He’s said a number of misleading things about the nature of the policy. He’s pretty egregiously misstated the data,” Hammond said of Cuomo’s responses.Kaiser Health News, (KHN), the news arm of the Kaiser Family Foundation reported on Tuesday that Gov. Cuomo’s claims about the effects of his March 25, 2020 guidance have been highly misleading:Cuomo frequently touts how well New York stacks up against other states in preventing nursing home covid deaths. In September, he said New York ranked 46th out of 50 states, a claim we examined and found to be Mostly False. A key problem is that until recently the New York totals didn’t include deaths of nursing home residents that occurred in hospitals.State comparisons are tricky. But most other states, perhaps all of them, do include hospital deaths in their covid nursing home totals, said Priya Chidambaram, a senior policy analyst at KFF, the Kaiser Family Foundation. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)“New York’s decision to pull out the hospital-based deaths was not based on standard practice,” she said, noting that federal rules for reporting covid nursing home deaths require that states include off-site deaths in hospitals.“That number was low as it was because they were not reporting the full count,” Hammond said of Cuomo’s September claim that KHN rated “mostly false.”“It was pretty disingenuous. It undermined his credibility. They still have not backed off on their claim that New York State did a wonderful job handling COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes.  The other explanations they’ve given about why they withheld data make no sense,” he added.Hammond also addressed the explosive admission by Melissa DeRosa, Secretary to Gov. Cuomo, made to Democratic lawmakers in early February, that the Cuomo administration withheld nursing home data to avoid scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice.“The DeRosa explanation, I think it was a strategy to convince the Democratic state legislators on the call not to make more of a fuss,” Hammond concluded.As a consequence of these revelations, public opinion appears to be turning against Cuomo’s credibility on this issue, as the Hill reported Monday:More than seven in 10 voters say New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) was aware of the true number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and concealed the figures, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll.Seventy-one percent of registered voters in the Feb. 24-26 survey said Cuomo was aware of how many residents had died in the state’s nursing homes during the pandemic but concealed the accurate figures. Twenty-nine percent said they didn’t think he was aware of the discrepancy.The survey results follow allegations that Cuomo’s administration purposely reported a lower number of nursing home deaths. The accusations are now the subject of an investigation by the FBI and U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.The governors of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are under fire for controversial nursing home policy decisions that critics say fueled coronavirus deaths in those facilities.On March 25, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) ordered nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for COVID-19, as the New York Post reported:An executive at the unnamed Queens nursing home says that the facility was coronavirus-free until Gov. Andrew Cuomo forced facilities in the state to accept coronavirus patients on March 25. . . Though not all 50 states are currently providing complete data, a huge percentage of the 83,231 COVID-19 deaths in the United States, as of 5 p.m. eastern on Tuesday, May 12, were among residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities.The Henry J. Kaiser Foundation has assembled nursing home/long-term care facility COVID-19 mortality data from the 33 states that report that data, and calculates that, as of May 7, nursing home and long term care facility residents accounted for 38 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in those states. The percentage of coronavirus deaths from nursing homes appears to be increasing as the pandemic drags on.The Kaiser Family Foundation currently reports as of March 3 that 35 percent, or 171,813, of the estimated 515,899 deaths from COVID-19 since the pandemic began are from residents of long term care (LTC) facilities.HealthPoliticsScienceCOVID-19Gov.

173,"The National Guard has been asked to stay in Washington, DC, for another 60 days, a National Guard source confirmed to Breitbart News after Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) stated Thursday afternoon that she was hearing from contacts about the request.Slotkin, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and former Pentagon official, said she had heard from contacts at the National Guard that Capitol Police asked them to extend their mission for 60 days and that the Guard is “soliciting states to send contributions.”“No one likes seeing the fortress-like security around the Capitol. And no one wants to again have a security problem in and around this symbolic place,” Slotkin wrote on Twitter:No one likes seeing the fortress-like security around the Capitol. And no one wants to again have a security problem in and around this symbolic place.— Rep. Elissa Slotkin (@RepSlotkin) March 4, 2021Slotkin added, “But whether an extension has been requested or the mission is indeed terminating on March 12, it’s critical that members of Congress get a briefing on what’s behind these decisions.”The Pentagon as recently as Tuesday said it had no additional requests from law enforcement authorities for an extension of the National Guard’s mission to assist federal and local law enforcement, which was slated to end next week, on March 12.However, Capitol Police said on Wednesday they have information regarding a possible plot by a militant group to breach the Capitol on Thursday.The U.S. House of Representatives, in response to the possible event, canceled the remaining week’s agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) wrapped up planned votes late Wednesday. Neither Pelosi’s website nor Twitter specifies if she left town for the weekend.The Senate is still in session, however, attempting to pass coronavirus relief legislation.The National Guard has been surrounding the U.S. Capitol in the wake of the January 6 breach of the building by pro-Trump protesters.Then-Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller authorized 7,000 National Guard forces, and that number was raised to more than 26,000 for President Joe Biden’s inauguration.The number was slated to go down to the mid-5,000s by mid-March, when the mission is slated to end.Republican lawmakers have blasted the continued deployment, which to date has cost nearly $500 million in American taxpayer funds.The deployment has also been a political headache for Democrats — who have argued their presence is needed — after dozens of National Guard troops were photographed being forced to take breaks in House and Senate parking garages by the Capitol building.Most recently, reports revealed that Michigan National Guard members in D.C. were being served meals with undercooked meat and metal shavings.Separately, Democrats are investigating if the Pentagon delayed deploying the National Guard after Capitol Police requested help.Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard William Walker on Wednesday testified that he immediately alerted Pentagon leadership of then-Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund’s request but that Pentagon officials were concerned about the “optics” of having uniformed guardsmen at the Capitol.According to Walker’s testimony, approval eventually came three hours and 19 minutes later from Miller.CrimeLaw and OrderPoliticsCapitol PoliceCapitol riotNancy PelosiNational Guard.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

175,"ORLANDO, Florida — A firearm is the “great equalizer,” particularly for women, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), who rose to fame after successfully getting a permit to carry concealed in Washington, DC, told Breitbart News. She blasted the radical left’s recent push for further gun restrictions, which includes the creation of a gun registry and psychological evaluations for gun owners.“Banning guns is not the answer. H.R. 127 is not the answer,” she said of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s (D-TX) proposal, which calls for the creation of a registry for firearms and ammunition, as well as psychological evaluations for gun owners.“The process for obtaining the license to own a firearm includes a criminal background check, a psychological evaluation, and the passage of a training course,” as Breitbart News detailed:A second, completely separate license would be required to own an AR-15, AK-47, or other firearm designated as “military-style weapons” by the Democrats.HR. 127 would also require that gun license applicants pay $800 to the Attorney General to cover liability insurance for owning a firearm.In the event that an issued license is revoked, the license holder would be required by law to surrender all firearms and ammunition to the Attorney General.“This is the most egregious gun legislation that I have ever seen come through, and once again we need the Senate to hold the line,” the congresswoman said.Boebert made waves after confirming last year her intention to “carry a firearm each day in D.C.” but told Breitbart News it comes down to the American people’s fundamental rights and their ability to protect themselves.The Colorado congresswoman said she first began to carry because she “felt threatened.” A man, she relayed, was beaten to death outside of a restaurant she owns in Rifle, Colorado. The incident prompted her to look at a “different avenue on how to protect” herself, and she took advantage of her state’s open carry laws.“I needed a way to protect the people that were around me. I needed a way to protect my four boys and myself. You and I, we’re petite women, and you know, I don’t know if we could defend ourselves against a potential stronger attacker,” she told Breitbart News, calling a firearm “the great equalizer.”“Talk about women’s rights. Well, don’t take my right away to defend myself. I don’t want to take your right away to defend yourself,” she said, noting that the crime rate in Washington, DC, is exponentially higher than the national average.“I need a way to protect myself. I have my Washington, DC concealed carry permit, but then I also have Speaker Pelosi who has put metal detectors outside of the House chambers. The one place that we were actually threatened, she wants to disarm us and make sure that we aren’t able to protect ourselves,” she said, referring to the January 6 Capitol riot.“Now mind you, she was whisked away to safety on January 6. We were left vulnerable. And so, it’s really unfortunate. And you know that day, I didn’t look over to my neighbors and say, ‘I hope there are enough metal detectors outside.’ No,” she said, adding that some members were breaking furniture so they would have a weapon if they needed it.When asked to identify her go-to firearm of choice, Boebert named her Glock 43.“It’s petite. It’s reliable. I started carrying a Glock because I wore it in the restaurant, and it kind of gets dirty with food and everything spilling, and so, I know that my Glock is going to be really reliable in a situation like that,” she said. “And, of course, it’s easy to disassemble and clean.”“My Glock 43 is definitely my go-to,” she added.Notably, House Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) said that the Democrats’ current push for gun control is only the beginning of their efforts.2nd AmendmentPoliticsgun controlGunsLauren Boebert.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
176,"Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack revealed Wednesday he will respond to demands for racial equity in agriculture by initiating a commission on discrimination.The equity commission will take the lead on addressing longstanding discrimination that has shut out black producers from federal assistance that kept many farmers in business over the years.Vilsack admits in an interview with Politico that’s just the start.“I think the key here is to understand the comprehensive nature of the work that needs to be done. It isn’t just one single program or one single mission area that needs to be examined. It’s all of USDA,” Vilsack said.“Here’s the challenge: We’re not only dealing with the specific issues of discrimination, but we’re dealing with the cumulative effect of that discrimination over a period of time,” he added.Advocates for small and medium-size farms and “farmers of color” worry the Biden administration’s big plans on the warming of the globe “could inadvertently worsen inequality by diverting more taxpayer dollars to the largest landowners in the U.S. — a group that is overwhelmingly white and has already received billions in direct payments in recent years,” according to Politico.“There is no doubt that as we structure and design this program, if we are to have a carbon bank, it has to work for farmers of all sizes,” Vilsack said. “It has to work for farmers in all parts of the country. It can’t just be designed for a particular subset of American agriculture if it’s to be successful.”Vilsack has also been working behind the scenes with lawmakers to help craft the $5 billion in debt relief and other assistance for black farmers in the coronavirus relief package H.R. 1319 (117) — provisions sponsored by Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA), the winner of the George Senate runoff against former Sen.

180,"An investigation into Baltimore City schools revealed, in one high school in which hundreds of students are failing, a student who passed only three classes in four years actually ranks near the top half of his class, with only a 0.13 grade point average.Project Baltimore, which investigates the Baltimore area’s public schools system and reports regularly on FOX 45 News, focused Monday on the case of Tiffany France’s son, who attends Augusta Fells Savage Institute of Visual Arts in west Baltimore.France’s son is 17 years old, but just found out he has been moved back to ninth grade because he has passed only three classes in four years.Calls to Shut Down City School Where 0.13 GPA Ranks Near Top Half of ClassCalls are mounting for a Baltimore City Public Schools high school to be investigated and shut down immediately. This, after an alarming Project Baltimore investigation found hundreds of students are failing at the west Baltimore high school.https://foxbaltimore.com/news/project-baltimorePosted by WBFF FOX 45 on Tuesday, March 2, 2021France, however, said she thought her son was doing well and only discovered his failed classes in February. She explained she assumed her son was doing well, because, even though he had apparently failed most of his classes, he was still being promoted each year.According to his transcripts, France’s son failed Spanish I and Algebra I, but was still promoted to Spanish II and Algebra II. Similarly, he failed English II but was still passed on to English III.“I’m just assuming that if you are passing, that you have the proper things to go to the next grade and the right grades, you have the right credits,” said France who, according to the news report, is a single mother with three children and three jobs.Project Baltimore discovered that, in his first three years at the school, France’s son failed 22 classes and was late or absent 272 days.“I feel like they never gave my son an opportunity, like if there was an issue with him, not advancing or not progressing, that they should have contacted me first, three years ago,” France said.“He’s a good kid. He didn’t deserve that,” she added. “Where’s the mentors? Where is the help for him? I hate that this is happening to my child.”According to Project Baltimore, a City Schools administrator, who asked to remain anonymous, said the school system failed France’s son because the procedures and interventions that have been established to help students who are falling behind or are chronically absent, were not put into action in this case.The administrator said:I get angry. There’s nothing but frustration. We see on the news the crime that occurs, the murders, the shootings, we know that there are high levels of poverty in Baltimore. Things like this are adding to that. His transcript is not unusual to me. I’ve seen many transcripts, many report cards, like this particular student.Baltimore City Schools CEO Dr. Sonja Santelises reportedly sent Project Baltimore the protocols for failing and absentee students, which include that school records can be accessed through a campus portal and that a student’s absence triggers an automated call to the family’s number.Santelises also sent a statement saying the school conducted home visits and that France visited the school.France, however, denies any of these things happened.Project Baltimore continued:What the statement does not address, is why France’s son was promoted despite failing classes. It doesn’t discuss his class rank, or the 58 other students with a GPA of 0.13 or lower. But it does say North Avenue is “reviewing actions that impacted student outcomes” at the school prior to this year.According to the report, France has removed her son from Augusta Fells and enrolled him in an accelerated program at Francis M. Wood in west Baltimore, from which, if he performs well, he could graduate by 2023.The results of the report led to calls for an investigation into Augusta Fells.C4, or Clarence Mitchell IV, and Bryan Nehman, co-hosts of the C4 and Bryan Nehman Show on WBAL Radio, demanded action Tuesday.“I believe it’s violating the constitution rights of the children,” said C4, according to Fox 45 News. “There is no way in the world you can look at what is being reported by Project Baltimore and say, they are providing those children with a thorough and efficient form of public education.”“This school needs to be shut down,” Nehman added. “If we have half the kids in the school that are below a .13. Not a 1.3, people. A .13; that school needs to be shut down. It’s not doing its job.”EducationPoliticsSocial JusticeBaltimore City Schoolspublic schools.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

All ladies deemed worth of the honor by the gentlemen receive 10 points for every signature at the end of the day. The New York Post reported on the criticism that led to the lesson being nixed:Male students were also reportedly given advisories — including referring to girls as “milady” and showing “courtly courtesy as they assist ladies who may have dropped an article by picking it up for them,” according to a subsequent tweet.Boys were also told not to use vulgarity or complain and to rise when females entered or exited a room.Twitter reactions varied — with some speculating that the assignments were supposed to demonstrate regressive gender roles of the period. But most respondents found the material unacceptable no matter the intent. The school eventually canceled the concept outright.“This assignment has been reviewed, and despite its historical context, it does not reflect our district and community values,” Dr. Anita Herbert, superintendent of the local district told Fox News. “The matter has been addressed with the teacher, and the assignment was removed.”Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comEducationPoliticschivalrycourtingDatinggentlemenladiesMedievalschool curriculumTexas.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
182,"Democrats voted against his amendment to the proposed coronavirus relief package that would have stopped American taxpayers’ money from going to illegal aliens in $1,400 stimulus checks, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Saturday.Sen. Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall. As a result, more Americans would be cut off from payments,” the article concluded.ImmigrationPoliticsPre-ViralcoronavirusIllegal Aliensstimulus checksTed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
183,"The president of the United States is not only flooding America with illegal immigrants, he’s flooding America with illegal immigrants sick with the coronavirus.To begin with, the very idea that our own president would brazenly break the law to flood our country with illegals is insane enough. The idea that our own president would flood our country with illegals during an economic recession when social services are already strained, is even more insane. But what kind of sociopath allows illegals (or anyone) into our country when they’re infected with a deadly virus reportedly responsible for the deaths of more than a half-million Americans?From the looks of it, at least right now, and thanks primarily to former President Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, America seems to finally be crawling out of the hell of the China Virus. Things could change with a mutated strain or with colder weather this fall, but as of now, deaths and infections are in decline. What’s more, Texas and Mississippi are feeling good enough about things to end their business restrictions and mask mandates.People are feeling hopeful that we might finally be at the beginning of the end of this thing, and what has that sociopath Joe Biden decided to to…?His Fraudulency is calling anyone who wants to ease restrictions “neanderthals” and, apparently because there’s not enough coronavirus in America, he’s importing the virus directly from Mexico.Why is Biden not being impeached?How is it not an impeachable offense? How is it not a violation of the Constitution to 1) open our borders to illegals, ignoring our laws, and 2) allow illegals infected with a deadly virus into our country?Let me tell you what I think’s going on here…The Democrat party’s desire to replace us Deplorable Neanderthals with compliant immigrants — legal and illegal — is just too tempting to put on hold, even during a recession, even during a pandemic.Secondly, call me cynical, but after five years of Democrats locking us down, lying about Russia collusion and fire extinguisher murders; after five years of Democrats trying to overturn the 2016 election, championing and funding the domestic terrorists in Black Lives Matter, and blacklisting anyone who disagrees, I think Biden is deliberately importing the virus.The truth is the truth is the truth, and the truth is that Democrats don’t want the pandemic to end.Think about it… This virus primarily kills Republicans (older people) and gives Democrats what they desire more than anything else: unconstitutional emergency powers to micromanage our lives, lock us down, make their mega-corporate donors richer, kill small business, twist children into something embittered and ignorant with anti-science school closings, and pervert our voting laws in a way that legalizes cheating.I’m sorry, but only evil people behave the way Democrats do. And only sociopaths import a virus from a foreign country.If someone else has an explanation, I’m all ears.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

184,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
185,"A report by the Washington Examiner’s Byron York outlines January’s Capitol rioters were armed with bear spray, not guns.York notes readers and news watchers may have the impression rioters had guns, as the riots are frequently described as an “armed insurrection.” In fact, York did a data search to find the phrase “armed insurrection” was used “2,339 times since January 6” to describe the riots.However, he points out “the armed insurrectionists did not use any firearms.”What York did find is that “a small number” of those taking part in the riots “did indeed have baseball bats or bear spray, and a few used flagsticks or even, in one case, a crutch as weapons to assault Capitol police.”AOC on Capitol riot: ""We came close to half of the House nearly dying on Wednesday."" https://t.co/I4nAcMDVUS— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 11, 2021Bear spray, crutches, etc., but no guns.York recounted a line of questioning Wednesday between Sen.

But I don’t want to speak on behalf of Metro and Capitol Police. But to my knowledge, none.JOHNSON: So nobody has been charged with an actual firearm weapon in the Capitol or on Capitol grounds?SANBORN: Correct.

186,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) March 5, 2021Malinowski made about 90 financial trades in total, most of which were individual stocks, according to trade records his office disclosed.The congressman was mostly a buyer as the stock market tanked in March 2020 — 15 of the 22 trades the congressman said he made that month were purchases.Federal records indicated that Malinowski also made dozens of other stock trades during 2019 but failed to publicly disclose them within the legally required 30- to 45-day disclosure window — or ever file periodic transaction reports for them.Malinowski disclosed these 2019 stock trades in August as part of an annual personal financial-disclosure report that all members of Congress must file.Malinowski campaigned in 2019 on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics and increase transparency to ensure regular people — not corporations or special interests — have the strongest voices in Washington.”Since he entered Congress in 2019, Malinowski has sponsored several bills regarding financial transparency and political money. The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

187,"I was honored to speak at this past weekend’s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which saw thousands of Americans gather to hear former President Trump and other conservative leaders.Judicial Watch is one of the nation’s most widely supported conservative groups and a fan favorite at CPAC. This is for good reason, as we address the rule of law crisis so many here in DC would rather avoid, as you’ll see in my CPAC remarks below:Judicial Watch is your watchdog in Washington – Hillary Clinton knows who we are, and President Trump knows who we are. I’m not sure what Joe Biden knows, but millions of patriots across the nation know and support our heavy lifting to expose and stop government corruption.Judicial Watch is famous for using the Freedom of Information Act to figure out what the government is up to. No one has done more to uncover government corruption – from Benghazi to Clinton emails to Obamagate to the Biden family racketeering scandal.The rule of law protects the high and low. But the corrupt Deep State and its partisan allies subvert the rule of law. They aimed high by targeting President Trump with illicit spying and contemptible abuses of his civil rights.President Trump is a crime victim.Who was behind the worst corruption scandal in American history? Obama, Biden, Comey, Brennan … you know the rest.And when Trump raised questions about this conspiracy and Biden corruption the corrupt DC Establishment was so panicked that they tried and failed to remove him from office with their first sham impeachment.Remember the abuses of Trump are also about distraction – protecting Biden, Clinton, and other Swamp leaders from accountability for any misconduct and crimes.Let’s talk about the new president. No other president in recent American history has been so compromised by credible corruption allegations. There is significant evidence that directly implicates President “Big Guy” Biden in criminal activity tied to Hunter Biden’s rackets in Ukraine and China and other countries.Big Media and Big Tech, which seem to be nothing more than left wing advocacy groups, censored or covered this up for years, and the Justice Department and FBI, true to form, focused on protecting Biden while targeting Trump.When it comes to exposing and uncovering government corruption, the DOJ and FBI are part of the problem – and have done more to undermine the confidence of the American people in the rule of law than just about anyone. Those institutions were irredeemably compromised under the Obama administration and spent most of the Trump administration either trying to destroy Trump at the behest of the Clinton/Obama/Schiff cabal or trying to cover up the real corruption that it should have pursued but never did.The failure of the Justice Department to hold any significant person accountable for Obamagate crimes is a scandal. Gosh, Biden is giving promotions to some of his Obamagate co-conspirators!John Durham was appointed almost two years ago and there has been little evidence of a serious criminal investigation of those implicated in Spygate abuses of Trump and other innocent Americans, such as General Flynn.And the FBI and Justice Department had Hunter’s laptop for years but did nothing but protect the Biden clan. Why, for example, is there not yet a special counsel for Biden corruption? We had the corrupt appointment of Mueller to investigate non-crimes to harass President Trump but nothing yet for President Biden.I call on the Justice Department to immediately appoint a special counsel to investigate Biden corruption.And let me say this to Special Counsel Durham – reports are nice but prosecutions are better!Judicial Watch isn’t waiting on a Biden special counsel or a Durham report.Judicial Watch, not Congress nor the dishonest media, first uncovered that Hunter Biden flew to China at least five times while his father was vice president. A Judicial Watch federal lawsuit also uncovered that the Obama State Department noted the Russians were trolling then-Vice President Biden’s “anti-corruption” activities in Ukraine because he was compromised by Hunter’s Burisma corruption.And then there is the Obamagate scandal. Much of what we know about this Obama/Biden scandal is a result of our unrelenting lawsuits and pressure. Heck, who needs an IG when you have Judicial Watch! And it was reconfirmed last year that targeting Trump was all about protecting Hillary over her emails!Even as Clinton cronies and enablers are in the Biden White House, we’re supposed to forget Clinton’s email crimes. Judicial Watch remembers. America remembers and still wants justice.By the way, it is now official. We can impeach former presidents and government officials. So, should we now impeach Obama, Hillary Clinton, Comey, Brennan, Susan Rice, and all the rest? And maybe we can have congressional impeachments! Schiff, Pelosi, Omar, and Swalwell!The Pelosi impeachments of President Trump are about election interference. The Left, with the help of their allies in Big Tech, want to be able to interfere with our elections and smear, jail and censor anyone who objects.The Left didn’t want to remove Trump because he incited violence. He didn’t and they don’t care about violence as they endorse and use it regularly. They wanted to abuse impeachment to undermine an effective leading opposition voice.The Left uses the pretext of COVID to rush through, sometimes contrary to law, long-sought changes in election rules that saw tens of millions of ballots and ballot applications being mailed to voter roll lists that are notoriously inaccurate.The tsunami of mail in ballots conveniently led to chaos in many key states on Election Day. By the way, federal law sets an Election Day, not an Election Week or an Election Month or an Election Winter.On Election Day, President Trump had the votes to win the presidency. These vote totals were changed because of unprecedented and extraordinary counting after Election Day.Judicial Watch has long warned of the chaos and increased risk of fraud from recklessly mailing 100 million ballots and ballot applications. Our most recent research using data from just before the election, revealed that 353 U.S. counties had 1.8 million more registered voters than eligible voting-age citizens. In other words, the registration rates of those counties exceeded 100% of eligible voters.In Pennsylvania, our litigation to clean up dirty voting rolls uncovered 800,000 “extra” names on the rolls.This maladministration of the elections, to put it charitably, undermined American’s confidence in the fairness of our elections and has significantly weakened Biden’s presidency. Let’s be clear. The Left ruined the election.How to fix this mess? Restore the rule of law on elections.One thing we aim to do is “get the receipts” about the 2020 election. Judicial Watch has 105 open record and Freedom of Information Act requests pending on the election.Another thing to do is clean up the rolls. Dirty voting rolls can mean dirty elections!A Judicial Watch federal lawsuit settlement is already resulting in LA County cleaning up to 1.5 million names from the rolls! And we’re in federal court now to clean up the rolls in Pennsylvania, Colorado, and North Carolina. And more lawsuits are coming, believe you me!And let me be clear, voting by mail should generally be ended. Vote by mail makes it nearly impossible to detect or even to pretend to prevent fraud. This security gap undermines confidence in the elections. Unless you’re putting your life on the line in Afghanistan or have some other emergency reason, the law should require you to vote in person – after your citizenship and eligibility has been verified and after you show your secure photo ID! And no ballot harvesting!Let me say this, if elections are not secure and are conducted in violation of the Constitution, many Americans will not vote in them. Secure elections conducted according to law will increase voter turnout!Can we have a debate on this? Not if Big Tech gets its way.Big Tech’s ban of President Trump for his blowing the whistle on the election is all about helping the Left.Neither Section 230 nor any other law allows Big Tech to lie to the public and shareholders about their dishonest censorship of conservative Americans. This is basic business fraud that should be investigated by law enforcement.But at the saying goes: you can trust the Communists – to be Communists.Sure enough, Communist and leftist partisans now seek to effectively criminalize those who advocate for free, fair, and secure elections. Big Tech’s censorship of former President Trump and other conservative leading voices provides cover to the Left’s broad and governmental attack on the God-given rights of tens of millions of Americans.If you want an example of how the Left views your First Amendment rights – take a look at the miles-long, barbed wire fence around the US Capitol.Don’t worry, Judicial Watch has Congress covered. We sued the Pelosi Congress for Capitol riot emails and video. We want to know what Pelosi and Schumer are hiding.Speaking of fences and walls, let’s talk about the border. Biden is seeking open-borders amnesty by hook or by crook, with zero regard for public health and safety – or rule of law.Biden would nationalize sanctuary policies that are not only illegal but deadly dangerous. He has launched the most significant attack on immigration law in American history.I could think of an article of impeachment or two for Biden’s outright refusal to enforce the law against illegal alien criminals and his policies that aid and abet human smuggling and child trafficking on the border! Biden is worse than Obama on lawless executive amnesty – and in just one month has caused a humanitarian and public health disaster on our Mexican border.What should be done?End sanctuary policies – both nationally and locally. Judicial Watch is in court in California and Maryland to challenge sanctuary policies that abuse taxpayers and harm the public safety.And just say no to amnesty! Even talking about amnesty increases illegal immigration!I think I’ve come up with a simple solution for the immigration crisis. President Trump knew this, too. Enforce the law!And, again, only citizens should vote. And we should change the laws to require you to prove your citizenship in order to register to vote.There is a way forward for conservatives.Here is the truth: The Biden administration is corrupt but weak. His party barely controls Congress. President Biden has a personal corruption problem, has obvious health challenges, must manage internal warfare between his party’s corrupt corporate wing and its rising Communists, and his moral claim on the presidency is rejected by a massive number of voters.But there are many loser Republicans who also have contempt for our concerns about Swamp corruption, election integrity, our borders, and accountable and constitutional government.So, it is Judicial Watch to the rescue. We know what to do. Sue them! Demand answers! Tell the truth! Protect citizens under the law! Defend the Constitution! Expose corrupt politicians of both political parties!As George Washington said, “Truth will ultimately prevail where pains is taken to bring it to light.”Again, Judicial Watch is your watchdog in Washington. We go to bat for you. We represent you. We defend you. We fight for you in court against those who would deny Americans their divine birthright – the rule of law.Thank you and God bless America!The video is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqpn1fxotKkTom Fitton is president of Judicial Watch, a nonprofit government watchdog.PoliticsCPACFreedom of Information Act (FOIA)Judicial Watchrule of law.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

But in recent years, critics have said some of his work was racist and presented harmful depictions of certain groups.In “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street,” a character described as “a Chinaman” has lines for eyes, wears a pointed hat, and carries chopsticks and a bowl of rice. (Editions published in the 1970s changed the reference from “a Chinaman” to “a Chinese man.”) In “If I Ran the Zoo,” two characters from “the African island of Yerka” are depicted as shirtless, shoeless and resembling monkeys.A school district in Virginia said over the weekend that it had advised schools to de-emphasize Dr. Seuss books on Read Across America Day, a national literacy program that takes place each year on March 2, the anniversary of Mr. Geisel’s birth. “Research in recent years has revealed strong racial undertones in many books written/illustrated by Dr. Seuss,” according to the statement by the district, Loudoun County Public Schools.Many schools across the country have routinely celebrated Seuss’ birthday and his books for children as part of Read Across America Day on March 2Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comPoliticsSocial JusticeDr. SeussJesse Jacksonracism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
189,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights. (This matches conservatives' view that transgenderism also attacks heterosexuality & health). So what is more important for progressives?

DeWine to fully open Ohio,” Mandel said in a phone interview. “That means removing the statewide mask mandate, removing all restrictions on businesses, and require that all schools open for in-person instruction.”Mandel, who issued a press release earlier on Wednesday and was even more scathing in his interview with Breitbart News, lit into DeWine—a fellow Republican—claiming DeWine is not following science but instead caving to a woke leftist mob of politically correct Democrats, and his refusal to open the state entirely and ditch the masks like other Republican governors have is an encroachment on Ohioans’ freedom. Mandel said DeWine’s actions empowered large multinational corporate conglomerates engaged in cancel culture while they penalized small businesses and families in Ohio.“What Gov. DeWine did was trample on the freedoms and liberties of everyday Ohioans,” Mandel, who recently spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, told Breitbart News. “He and the health director Amy Acton, who saw herself as like a mini-Fauci, their numbers and predictions were dead wrong. They used faulty numbers and bad math to completely trample on the freedoms and liberties of moms, dads, and Ohio small business owners. One of the things they did that made my blood boil was they shut down family-owned small businesses but allowed these woke politically correct conglomerates like Target and Walmart and Costco to stay open. In my mind, the companies like Target, Walmart, and Costco—who are embracing cancel culture, embracing wokeness, and sticking it to the little guy—they’re the enemy. We as conservatives, we should be standing up for small business owners and moms and dads, not these multinational conglomerates who are trying to jam political correctness and wokeness and cancel culture down our throats. On top of that, the far left purports to care about black lives and racial injustice, but in my mind the greatest racial injustice of our lifetimes is going on right now, where the politicians, bureaucrats, and teachers unions won’t let inner city kids go back to school. In our urban areas in Ohio and throughout the country there is unfortunately a higher percentage of fatherless households and a lot of single moms in these areas are working extra hard to be fantastic parents and put food on the table and these DeWine shutdowns screwed them over the worst.”Mandel also said that the lockdowns and shutdown and mandates across America the past year have been “all about power” and not about science or public health, as he noted that many of the models on the pandemic that public health officials nationally and in various states have used to craft policy have proven incorrect.“They [the lockdowns and mandates] were all about politicians and faceless bureaucrats exercising power over the people,” Mandel said. “The way the framers of the Constitution envisioned America was a nation in which government would be limited in size and scope and the citizenry would have power over the government. Unfortunately, people like squishy establishment Republicans like Mike DeWine and others flipped that upside down and they took the big hand of government and invaded the liberties and freedoms we enjoy as Americans. On the math, this Amy Acton lady—she was like the Fauci of Ohio, the mini-Fauci. Her numbers were not even in the ballpark of accurate, but that did not stop the media and the politicians in Ohio from trotting her out to be a hero. They made her out to be a hero. In reality, she was a complete failure and she was dead wrong and DeWine based his shutdowns on her bad math.”Mandel’s criticisms of DeWine come as states like Texas and Mississippi join a dozen plus others with announcements this week they are abandoning mask mandates entirely and moving to reopen their states’ economies 100 percent with no public health restrictions. Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Tate Reeves of Mississippi made their announcements earlier this week and join a slew of other states nationwide—all led by Republicans—in ditching the mask mandates and lockdowns. The other states, including South Dakota and Florida—whose governors, respectively Kristi Noem and Ron DeSantis, have commanded tons of media attention for resisting lockdown pressure—have fared about as well as any state with onerous restrictions. According to reports from establishment media outlets, though, the moves by Texas and Mississippi surprised Democrat President Joe Biden’s administration, angering the newly elected president for their open willingness to flout his recommendations this early into his term.Biden had been calling for Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days. But now, less than halfway into that, several states are openly defying Biden—essentially defenestrating the president and his authority, demonstrating his fecklessness. As Breitbart News reported earlier on Wednesday, Alabama is expected to join the charge next, and establishment media outlets predict more GOP governors around the country will undercut Biden in the coming days and weeks.Biden, in response, lambasted the two states—Mississippi and Texas—that did not vote for him in the presidential election in November as following “Neanderthal thinking.” Biden accusing his political opponents and critics of being primitive and subhuman has not helped his cause, as Alabama sources told Breitbart News that the governor’s move to lift the state’s mask mandate—expected at a Thursday press conference—is in large part because of Biden’s disrespect for American voters.Nonetheless, more establishment-leaning GOP governors like Ohio’s DeWine are caught in the middle trying to defend highly unpopular–and frankly questionable-at-best in terms of effectiveness–policies like economic restrictions and mask mandates while Biden accuses other Republicans of being Neanderthals.In a lengthy response to Mandel—and to Biden’s Neanderthal comment—sent to Breitbart News on Wednesday afternoon, DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney claimed the state is keeping its restrictions in place until more Ohioans get vaccinated.“Ohio’s goal is to save as many lives as possible while we distribute vaccine to those who want it,” Tierney said. “We are moving closer to a stage where, when all Ohioans who want a vaccine can get one, it will be the vaccine stopping the virus spreading instead of mitigation efforts such as masks and social distancing stopping the virus from spreading. Until we hit that critical mass of vaccinations, we need to keep up COVID mitigation protocols to stop the virus from spreading and infecting those who could die from the virus before they can get a vaccine if they want one. The good news is that we keep getting great news on vaccine supply. Pfizer and Moderna are ramping up production; Johnson and Johnson is now available, and they have announced an additional manufacturing partner to help produce more of their vaccine. There is light at the end of the tunnel in terms of hitting that critical mass of vaccinations, but we are not there yet, and we have not progressed far enough into the vaccination phases to know exactly when we will hit that point. As we get closer to offering vaccines to any Ohio who wants one, we will be closer to knowing what dates this might be. Until then, we need to keep using masks and social distancing to prevent the virus from spreading until we get to the point where it is the vaccine stopping the virus from spreading.”Tierney’s statement also criticized Texas for previously setting capacity limits on restaurants, and also claimed that Ohio never closed churches or houses of worship at all.“I will also add that Ohio has been a leader in opening early after the White House’s and CDC’s stay at home period last year. Despite assertions to the contrary, Ohio never closed churches or houses of worship,” Tierney said. “Unlike Texas, Ohio never set capacity percentage limits upon restaurants; restaurants can accommodate as many customers as can be socially distanced amongst parties. Ohio has been a leader in returning K-12 students to in-classroom learning opportunities. Ohio’s economy is recovering, and unemployment is going down, and this is in part to keeping the spread of the virus low. Wearing masks and social distancing is helping keep the virus low and protecting not only Ohioans, but Ohio’s economy.”Nonetheless, the building anger against restrictions and mandates is clear, and people like Mandel are demanding that DeWine change to reflect new information and approaches championed by other governors like DeSantis, Noem, Abbott, and Reeves.“There are models around the country that Gov. DeWine could follow,” Mandel said. “I’m not even asking him to be a leader. I’m just asking him to be a follower and do what other states have done, and unfortunately he is following mini-Faucis around the country and liberal woke politically correct organizations instead of doing what’s best for the people in this state. If I were to look at a model governor who’s handled the shutdowns best, it’s Gov. Ron DeSantis down in Florida. While governors around the country were giving into the peer pressure and the groupthink, Gov. DeSantis had the guts to attack them, to stand up for what he thought was right, and at the end of the day the math and the economics proved out that he was in fact right. The liberal media hates facts. What the liberal media loves is hyperbole and sensation, but when you offer the liberal media facts, they start to hyperventilate and they get triggered. The facts are that Gov. DeSantis was the best governor in America on this issue and I also want to applaud what Gov. Abbott in Texas and Gov. Reeves in Mississippi did yesterday by opening up their states. I’m calling on Gov. DeWine today to do the same. Gov. Noem has been a real champion on this and I applaud Gov. Noem for being the tip of the spear and her leadership on this as well.”What’s more, Mandel understands that what these other governors are doing is a deviation from what the Biden White House is pushing for—and he thinks DeWine needs to get with the program and follow suit. Mandel does not care what Biden is saying or advocating for, and he thinks Biden is a mess not worth listening to.“I think Biden is lost in the sauce,” Mandel said. “He is listening to horrible advice based on bad math with complete disregard to our constitutional freedoms and liberties. It gets me motivated and charged up to see governors like Kristi Noem and Greg Abbott and Ron DeSantis and Tate Reeves really leading the charge to take on the Biden Administration on this. Unfortunately here in Ohio we have this squishy establishment governor in DeWine who’s acting like Biden instead of acting like a conservative. Listen, when Republicans act like Democrats, I always lead the charge to take them on, because there’s no room in the Republican Party for establishment squishes.”Mandel is one of several GOP U.S. Senate candidates in Ohio next year for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH). The other major declared candidate at this time is former Ohio GOP chairwoman Jane Timken, but businessman Mike Gibbons and author J.D. Vance are reportedly considering bid, as well as possibly several members of the Ohio GOP congressional delegation. A recent Axios report noted that Timken almost had received an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, but Trump ended up decided to hold off on backing her for now and let the primary process play out a bit.Mandel, who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 2012 against Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH)—and was again briefly a candidate against Brown in 2018 but dropped out of the race in the primary—is clearly trying to position himself as a hard-charging conservative against the GOP establishment that undermined Trump.“As state Treasurer, I was John Kasich’s worst nightmare,” Mandel told Breitbart News. “When Kasich was acting like a Democrat on Obamacare, Common Core, and taxes, I took him on, and I was the lead combatant in trying to stop him from jamming those liberal policies down our throats. I’m doing that now with Gov. DeWine. It’s not lost on me that Gov. DeWine is not happy with me. But I don’t care. The reason I’m running for the U.S. Senate is to stand up for the freedoms and liberties of individuals, not to make friends in Columbus or Washington.”HealthPoliticscoronavirusCovidFloridaGreg AbbottJoe BidenJosh MandelKristi Noemlockdownsmask mandateMike DeWineMississippiOhioOn the HillRob PortmanRon DeSantisschoolsSenateSouth DakotaTate ReevesTexas.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
191,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
192,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says President Joe Biden is “recklessly releasing” illegal aliens into the state of Texas after they have tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus.A report by NBC News this week confirmed that Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is releasing border crossers into the U.S. interior who then are testing positive for the coronavirus. Even after border crossers test positive, they are not required to quarantine.Abbott, in a statement on Wednesday evening, wrote that the Biden administration “must immediately end” the Catch and Release policy.“The Biden Administration is recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities,” Abbott wrote in a post. “The Biden Admin. must IMMEDIATELY end this callous act that exposes Texans & Americans to COVID.”The Biden Administration is recklessly releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants who have COVID into Texas communities. The Biden Admin. must IMMEDIATELY end this callous act that exposes Texans & Americans to COVID.— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) March 3, 2021In Brownsville, Texas, DHS is sending border crossers into the community where local health officials then must test them. Regardless of a negative or positive test result, the border crossers are allowed to continue traveling into the U.S. interior — many heading to Maryland, New Jersey, and North Carolina.Since Brownsville officials started testing released border crossers, about 6.3 percent or nearly 110 have tested positive for the coronavirus and are sent on their way.Similarly, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) called Biden’s Catch and Release policy an “anti-America First and anti-science” iniative.“Illegal aliens with COVID-19 are being caught and then released into the United States,” Brooks wrote in a post. “This is anti-America First and anti-Science. Socialist Dems have built a wall around the Capitol to protect themselves, but won’t protect you!”Illegal aliens with COVID-19 are being caught and then released into the United States.

In a Harvard/Harris poll conducted last month of nearly 1,800 registered voters, 67 percent said border crossers should be returned to Mexico — as they were under the Remain in Mexico policy that Biden ended — while just 33 percent said they should be released into the U.S. interior.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

194,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980.

Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
195,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

197,"WASHINGTON, DC — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in his first major foreign policy speech Wednesday highlighting the Biden administration’s goals, promised not to rely on “costly military interventions” to promote democracy, an approach the secretary said has not worked.Blinken proclaimed:We will not promote Democracy through costly military interventions or by attempting to overthrow authoritarian regimes by force. We have tried these tactics in the past. However well-intentioned, they haven’t worked. They’ve given democracy promotion a bad name, and they’ve lost the confidence of the American people. We will do things differently.To support democracy across the globe, Blinken proclaimed that the State Department “will use the power of our example. We will encourage others to make key reforms, overturn bad laws, fight corruption, and stop unjust practices. We will incentivize democratic behavior.”Biden has vowed to lead with diplomacy to deal with today’s threats, Blinken said, noting that “Americans are rightly wary of prolonged U.S. military interventions abroad.”The secretary added:We’ve seen how they’ve often come at far too high a cost, both to us and to others. When we look back at the past decades of our military involvement in the world, especially in Afghanistan and the Middle East, we must remember what we’ve learned about the limits of force to build a durable peace; that the day after a major military intervention is always harder than we imagine; and how critical it is to pursue every possible avenue to a diplomatic solution.…Of course, we will never hesitate to use force when American lives and vital interests are at stake. That’s why President Biden authorized an airstrike last week against Iranian-backed militia groups targeting U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. But in that case – and in future cases when we must take military action – we will do so only when the objectives and mission are clear and achievable, consistent with our values and laws, and with the informed consent of the American people. And we’ll do it together with diplomacy.The Pentagon cited the U.S. Constitution and United Nations international law as the source for Biden’s legal authority to carry out the recent airstrikes against Iran-backed Shiite militias, including some deemed terrorist groups by the Trump administration.After promoting diplomacy over military force, Blinken acknowledged that China poses a challenge to the international system, noting that the ties between U.S. and China are the world’s “biggest geopolitical test” of the century.The Biden administration would “manage” ties with communist China “from a position of strength,” Blinken asserted.
U.S. officials would continue to compete, collaborate, and be “adversarial” with China, if necessary, said the secretary.Blinken highlighted examples of why he believes promoting peace through military force is a fool’s errand that sounds similar to military action taken during the Obama-Biden administration.Soon after taking office, Obama escalated the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, resulting in the highest number of casualties under any president.Trump attempted to end what he described as the endless wars against terrorism, namely in Iraq and Afghanistan to avail.Nevertheless, soon before leaving office, he reduced the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan to a historically low 2,500 troops in each country.The Trump administration used a historic airstrike campaign against the Taliban and, to a lesser extent, its top source of funding — labs for making opium into heroin — to help pressure the group to join the peace pact table with the U.S. and the Kabul government.Biden administration officials say they are reviewing the February 2020 U.S-Taliban deal, which calls for a complete withdrawal of foreign troops by May 1, 2021.The Biden administration is reportedly considering extending the U.S. military presence beyond May, prolonging America’s longest war.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAfghanistanAntony BlinkenBarack ObamaIraqJoe BidenLibyaSyriaU.S. Secretary of State.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

202,"ORLANDO, Florida — Former Georgia Rep. Vernon Jones (R) condemned the Democrat Party, which he left in January, for being unaccepting of “independent-thinking black men” like himself, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News this past weekend.Jones, speaking during an exclusive interview while attending the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, first recalled what he described as a “frightening” encounter last year with Black Lives Matter protesters and then railed into his former party for being unwelcoming toward him because of his views.Following former President Donald Trump’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last August in D.C., Breitbart News captured protesters — some of whom were affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement — harassing Jones, shouting obscenities such as “you’re a fucking disgrace” and “you house [N-word]” at him as he and a female companion made their way through the street.Jones said “it was a very frightening experience” and that he “was caught completely off guard.”“I’m like, ‘Wait a minute, but I’m black. If black lives matter, I’m not a black life? Are you targeting me just because of my choice, my First Amendment freedom of speech, who I decide I want to support? And you’re supposed to be about some kind of social justice? Wait a minute, the height of hypocrisy. No, you’re thugs. You’re criminals,’” Jones said.He described police encircling him and the woman he was with to protect them during the run-in with the protesters. “They literally put their lives on the line for me, and how they were treating those police officers, including some of them being African American. So this is not about black lives matter,” Jones assessed. “It had nothing to do with this.”Asked if the experience motivated him to leave the Democrat Party, Jones countered, “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me,” adding that the present-day party is unrecognizable compared to the party he had joined 30 years ago.Jones broke from his party last year to support Trump in the 2020 presidential election and attributed his endorsement largely to Trump’s support for black Americans, citing the administration’s “overwhelming” financial support for historically black colleges and universities, record low unemployment rate for black Americans prior to the mass coronavirus shutdowns, and criminal justice reform in the signing of the First Step Act.Georgia Democrat Party chair and now-Rep. Nikema Williams (D-GA) lambasted Jones when he publicly made his endorsement last April, calling him an “embarrassment” to the Democrat Party for choosing “to stand with the racist president.”Jones announced in January that he would officially switch to the Republican Party.Moments ago, I announced that I am officially joining the Republican Party. Now more than ever, the Republican Party is in desperate need of leaders that know how to fight. I know how to fight.— Vernon Jones (@RepVernonJones) January 6, 2021The Georgia Republican quipped to Breitbart News, “I like to say I brought a grand new party to the grand old party — brand new ideas, brand new opportunities, brand new people.”“The left, they are horrified by independent-thinking black men like me because we don’t believe that just because we’re black that we should vote for Joe Biden, because we don’t believe just because we’re black we don’t know how to get on the Internet and find out about COVID,” Jones said in reference to a comment Biden made last year when he said in a Breakfast Club interview that “if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black” and this year during a town hall when Biden suggested minorities do not know how to “get online” to access information about coronavirus.“Now Joe Biden said those things in ’20 and ’21. Where’s the left? Why is there not an outcry? Can you imagine if President Trump had said something like that? It’s just double standard,” Jones said. “So it was no question. That so-called ‘big tent’ the Democrat Party has, it’s only for folks for the left. Not for independent-thinking blacks or African Americans.”He added, “This identity politics?

Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall. As a result, more Americans would be cut off from payments,” the article concluded.ImmigrationPoliticsPre-ViralcoronavirusIllegal Aliensstimulus checksTed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
204,"President Joe Biden blamed former President Barack Obama on Wednesday for underselling the administration’s 2009 stimulus spending bill.“[T]he economists told us we literally saved America from a depression,” Biden boasted in his remarks during the House Democratic Caucus Virtual Issues Conference on Wednesday night.At the time, Obama put Biden in charge of preventing waste in the massive $787 billion spending program.“To you, he’s Mr. Vice President, but around the White House, we call him the sheriff,” Obama said at the time.Biden expressed regret Obama undercut his attempt to promote the success of the stimulus program.“[W]e didn’t adequately explain what we had done,” Biden said. “Barack was so modest, he didn’t want to take, as he said, a ‘victory lap.'”Biden continued criticizing Obama during his remarks, warning Democrats not to make the same mistake with his newly proposed $1.9 trillion spending package.“I kept saying, ‘Tell people what we did,'” Biden recalled. “He said, ‘We don’t have time. I’m not going to take a victory lap.’ And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.”Biden said his massive spending package was overwhelmingly popular with Americans.“We never had anything this urgent and this ambitious that was so widely embraced,” he said.He predicted a long future of political success for the party if the spending package was passed and promoted by Democrats.“I know parts of this — and everything else we seek to do — are not easy, but people are going to remember how we showed up in this moment, how we listened to them — to them — not special interests; to them — and how we took action,” he said.PoliticsBarack ObamaJoe BidenWhite House.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
205,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
206,"The Transportation Department’s Inspector General made public on Wednesday a report that cites repeated examples of former Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao allegedly using her staff and her office to help benefit her family and their business operations and revealed that staff members at the agency had raised ethics concerns.Elaine Chao is Sen. Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) wife, who notably resigned the day after the Capitol riot.The inspector general’s investigation detailed a series of instances in which Elaine Chao reportedly directed her staff to spend federal government time and resources to help with matters related to a family shipping company and her father.“A formal investigation into potential misuses of position was warranted,” Mitch Behm, the department’s deputy inspector general, said on Tuesday in a letter to House lawmakers, accompanying a 44-page report detailing the investigation and the findings of wrongdoing.The report indicated “Chao had used her staff to make extensive arrangements in 2017 for the planned trip to China, which was canceled just before her planned departure after ethics concerns were raised.”The Chao family company, Foremost Group, was responsible as of 2019 for a large portion of orders at one of China’s biggest state-funded shipyards and has secured long-term charters with a Chinese state-owned steelmaker, Breitbart News found. Foremost’s ships carry bulk cargo such as iron ore and coal, focusing on shipping those commodities to China.The investigation noted the trip was scheduled to include stops at locations in China that received financial support from her family’s company and also a meeting with “top leaders” in China that was scheduled to include her father and sister but not other members of the Transportation Department staff.The investigators also found that Chao repeatedly asked agency staff members to help “do chores for her father, including editing her father’s Wikipedia page, promoting his Chinese-language biography,” and directing two staff members from the transportation secretary’s office to send a copy of her father’s book “to a well-known CEO of a major U.S. corporation” to ask if he would write a foreword for the book.Apparently, staff members for Elaine Chao’s office were assigned in 2017 to check with the Department of Homeland Security on “the status of a work permit application for a foreign student studying in the U.S. who had received a scholarship from a Chao family foundation,” the report said.The student, according to the report, had interviewed Elaine Chao’s father, James Chao, at the New York headquarters of the family’s shipping company in order to share James Chao’s experience “with Chinese millennials.”Transportation Department staff members were given the job of arranging details for James Chao’s trip to China in October 2017, including asking, through the State Department, for China’s transport ministry to arrange for two cars for the six-person delegation, which included Chao’s younger sister, Angela Chao, who had succeeded their father as head of the family shipping company, and Angela Chao’s husband, the venture capitalist Jim Breyer.Elaine Chao’s trip to China that year was abruptly canceled after news organizations wondered about the makeup of Elaine Chao’s delegation, the New York Times wrote.Breitbart News reported in 2019 that Chao and her husband, Mitch McConnell, have directly benefited from the Chao family business. As Breitbart News senior contributor Peter Schweizer recounts in his book Secret Empires, Chao’s father — Mitch McConnell’s father-in-law — gave the Washington power couple a “gift” (the term used on McConnell’s financial disclosure forms to report this transaction) of between $5 to $25 million in 2008.According to the New York Post, the “gift” had a major impact on the couple’s net worth: “In 2004, current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, current U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, had an average net worth of $3.1 million. Ten years later, that number had increased to somewhere between $9.2 million and $36.5 million.”As New York magazine noted, “in many of the videos James Chao brags about his daughter’s government work and contacts. In one video he describes talking with Trump on Air Force One. ‘The president spent several minutes with me,’ he said. ‘We were talking about business.’”AsiaCrimePoliticsChinaCorruptionElaine ChaoForemost GroupMitch McConnellpublic corruptionSecret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and FriendsSecretary of Transportation.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
207,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) March 5, 2021Malinowski made about 90 financial trades in total, most of which were individual stocks, according to trade records his office disclosed.The congressman was mostly a buyer as the stock market tanked in March 2020 — 15 of the 22 trades the congressman said he made that month were purchases.Federal records indicated that Malinowski also made dozens of other stock trades during 2019 but failed to publicly disclose them within the legally required 30- to 45-day disclosure window — or ever file periodic transaction reports for them.Malinowski disclosed these 2019 stock trades in August as part of an annual personal financial-disclosure report that all members of Congress must file.Malinowski campaigned in 2019 on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics and increase transparency to ensure regular people — not corporations or special interests — have the strongest voices in Washington.”Since he entered Congress in 2019, Malinowski has sponsored several bills regarding financial transparency and political money. The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

208,"The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed H.R. 1, otherwise known as the “For the People Act,” which Republicans warn will compromise election integrity and ultimately lead to the federalization of U.S. elections.The Democrat-led House passed the legislation on party lines, 220 to 210. A summary of the bill notes that it “expands voter registration (e.g., automatic and same-day registration) and voting access (e.g., vote-by-mail and early voting)” and imposes limits on removing voters from voter rolls.Republicans have warned that the Democrat legislation would vastly reduce the power of the states to control and operate elections at the local level.“If this bill passes, it puts in all these terrible provisions,” Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Heritage Foundation’s Election Law Reform Initiative and a senior legal fellow of the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, said during a January appearance on Breitbart News Daily.“It’s a federal micromanagement of the election process, and everything that folks on the left want to reduce the integrity [and] the security of the election process is in there,” he continued.“If you’re a state like Alabama or Texas that has a voter ID law, you might as well forget it, because this federal law would override all state voter ID laws so they’re now unenforceable,” von Spakovsky added.Speaking to Breitbart News on Tuesday, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) warned that the “Socialist Democrat Election Fraud Enhancement Act” would do “great damage” to the nation’s election system by taking power away from the states.“The socialists seek to mandate no-fault absentee ballots, which are the tool of choice for vote thieves. They seek to eliminate the photo identification requirement and, by the way, when the federal government does it, that eliminates all state laws to the contrary,” Brooks said.“It, to a very large degree, federalizes and micromanages the election process administered by the states. It implemented, as I mentioned, some of the worst changes in election rules that occurred during the 2020 election,” the Alabama congressman continued. “It requires states to restore the ability of felons to vote the moment they’re out of prison, regardless of uncompleted parole, probation, or restitution requirements or what states may believe is the appropriate restoration of voting rights for convicted felons.”Rep. Lauren Boebart (R-CO) also warned against the legislation during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News last week.“We have H.R.1 and the Democrats, they call this the ‘For the People Act.’ No. It’s the ‘For the Swamp Act.’ This is something that will federalize our elections. It’s a D.C. takeover of our elections,” Boebert said. “This goes right back to them controlling the language. They act like it’s something that’s great for you.  … They act like all of these things are wonderful for the American people, and they’re not.”“But the ‘For the People Act,’ ‘For the Swamp Act,’ you know, this actually has tax dollars that will pay for politicians’ campaigns. It’s disgusting,” she added. “No tax dollar should go to a campaign.”As Fox News reported, “A major pillar of the legislation is setting up a new public financing system for congressional and presidential elections to incentivize small-dollar donations”:The legislation would establish a 6:1 match for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200.For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in public funds for a total contribution of $1,400.Other Republicans forcefully spoke out against the bill following the passage:Every single American should be OUTRAGED by this:Democrats just voted to ban voter ID nationwide and force every state to permanently expand mail-in voting.— Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) March 4, 2021H.R. 1, the “For the Politicians Act,” would allow public funds to be used to finance politicians’ reelection campaigns.

209,"President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the Department of Justice (DOJ) as Attorney General, Merrick Garland, is still refusing to say whether he supports decriminalizing illegal immigration.Last month, during a Senate confirmation hearing, Garland was asked by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) if he supported criminally prosecuting illegal entry to the United States and if prosecutions of illegal aliens would continue under his watch.Garland responded by saying he had not “thought about that question” and “I just don’t know” in reference to whether the DOJ would keep prosecuting illegal aliens.“I don’t know what the current program even is with respect to this … so I assume that the answer would be yes, but I don’t know what the issues surrounding it are,” Garland said.In written responses to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Garland has yet to say if he would back decriminalizing illegal immigration, as many Democrats have previously suggested, by making it only a civil penalty rather than a criminal penalty.“As I said at the hearing, I haven’t thought about that question,” Garland wrote in response to Cotton’s question. “The President has made clear that we are a country of borders with a concern about national security. I don’t know of a proposal to decriminalize, but still make it unlawful to enter. Since the hearing, I have not had time to think further about the question.”Democrats are trying to expedite Judge Garland’s confirmation vote. I’m blocking them because Judge Garland has refused to answer basic questions, including whether illegally entering the country should remain a crime. pic.twitter.com/Cv2FHF6VwV— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 3, 2021When Cotton asked if an illegal gang member or assailant who has been ordered removed from the U.S. by a federal immigration judge should be deported, Garland likewise refused to answer the question.“The process of removal after proceedings in immigration court is governed by the immigration laws,” Garland wrote in response to both scenarios. “I have not studied those laws, or the practical issues involved in the removal process, in detail.”Judge Garland could not answer whether an illegal alien who assaults a U.S. citizen and is ordered by a court to be deported should be deported. pic.twitter.com/sriRhiNM7W— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 3, 2021Cotton said he is blocking Garland’s nomination, which has already been advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a 15 to seven vote. Seven Senate Republicans opposed Garland’s nomination advancement out of committee while four Senate Republicans joined Democrats in support.“Ensuring the Senate has time to debate these issues and get answers is the same thing that Senate Democrats did for Bill Barr,” Cotton wrote. “We’re not going to have one standard for Trump’s nominees and another for Biden’s.”Ensuring the the Senate has time to debate these issues and get answers is the same thing that Senate Democrats did for Bill Barr. We’re not going to have one standard for Trump’s nominees and another for Biden’s.— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) March 3, 2021In addition to his refusal to answer questions surrounding the DOJ’s role in federal immigration matters, Garland told senators he was unaware that the Mexican drug cartels use the nation’s asylum system to traffic their members and drugs into the U.S.“I had not known about this and I will certainly look into this problem,” Garland said when asked about the cartels’ gaming the asylum system.For years, the DOJ has charged thousands of illegal aliens with illegal entry. Between fiscal years 2016 and 2019, U.S. attorneys charged more than 83,400 illegal aliens with illegal entry. In that same time period, U.S. attorneys charged nearly 232,000 illegal aliens with misdemeanor improper entry and more than 14,550 with alien smuggling.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

210,"The majority of Americans appear to disagree with the left’s vehement pursuit of overhauling school sports, rejecting the prospect of allowing transgender students to participate on sports teams of the gender they identify with rather than their biological gender, a Rasmussen Reports survey released Tuesday found.“Do you favor or oppose allowing transgender students to participate on the sports teams of the gender they identify with?” the survey asked 1,000 American respondents.A majority, or 54 percent, opposed the idea, followed by 32 percent who favored it and 14 percent who indicated they remained unsure.Those sentiments, however, are sharply divided on party lines. Fifty-two percent of Democrats favor allowing transgender students to participate on teams based on their gender identity, compared to 17 percent of Republicans and 24 percent of those unaffiliated with either major party. In contrast, 77 percent of Republicans oppose — a sentiment embraced by 33 percent of Democrats and a majority, or 57 percent, of independent voters.The survey also asked, “Is the addition of transgender athletes to girls’ and women’s sports likely to change those sports for the better or the worse?”Fifty-three percent said it will change sports for the “worse,” followed by 20 percent who said it will have no impact. Fourteen percent said they were not sure, and 13 percent said it will be for the better. Even a plurality of Democrats, 32 percent, said it will change sports for the worse.The survey, taken February 24-25, has a margin of error of +/- 3 percent.The results follow the House passing the Equality Act last week, 224-206.“The left will lay down the rights and security of millions of Americans, particularly young women, at the altar of gender ideology,” Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) said in a fiery floor speech last week, warning that the left will not cease until there is “complete and total compliance” with their definition of gender.“I can think of no better description of the so-called Equality Act, or inequality act, than this.

211,"Foreign nationals gathered at the United States-Mexico border this week to demand President Joe Biden’s administration release them into the interior of the country, as they have done with thousands of other border crossers.On March 2, about a hundred foreign nationals from Mexico, Central America, Haiti, and Cuba protested near San Ysidro, California in Tijuana, Mexico where they requested the Biden administration allow them into the U.S.Wearing t-shirts with Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign logo and the words “Please let us in!” the group of foreign nationals held signs that read “Biden — please let me enter.” In interviews with AFP, some of the foreign nationals said Biden ought to allow them to enter the U.S. while they await their asylum claims as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has done with others.“We want an answer from your president, we want someone to come out and give us an answer,” one of the protesters told nearby U.S. federal immigration officials.(GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)(GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)(GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)(GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)(GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)(GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)(GUILLERMO ARIAS/AFP via Getty Images)As Breitbart News has reported, the Biden administration has been releasing thousands of border crossers into the U.S. every week. In the case of 25,600 migrants who were enrolled in the Remain in Mexico program, which Biden ended, the United Nations is facilitating releases of migrants into the country.Most recently, reports confirmed that border crossers released into American communities are testing positive for the Chinese coronavirus and still do not have to adhere to quarantine requirements. Instead, after testing positive, border crossers can continue traveling into the U.S. interior.The massive restart of the Catch and Release program, as a result of Biden ending the Remain in Mexico program and cooperative asylum agreements with Central America, is driving a flood of illegal immigration to the southern border. This year, DHS officials are expecting to welcome at least 117,000 Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) into the U.S.Biden’s restart of Catch and Release has garnered significant opposition from most Americans. When asked if border crossers should be returned to Mexico or released into the U.S. interior, 67 percent of Americans told Harvard/Harris pollsters that they should be returned to Mexico — including 54 percent of Hispanic Americans and 68 percent of swing voters.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

212,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen.

213,"Millions of Americans remain under business restrictions, mask mandates, and quarantine requirements as foreign nationals testing positive for the Chinese coronavirus are traveling freely into the United States interior.This week, as President Joe Biden’s administration continues releasing thousands of border crossers into the U.S. interior after restarting the Catch and Release program, a report by NBC News confirmed that at over 100 border crossers released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have tested positive for the coronavirus.Most notably, towns along the U.S.-Mexico border are being forced to test border crossers after they are released by DHS because the agency has no testing requirements. Even after border crossers test positive, they are not required to quarantine and continue traveling into the U.S. interior as many are doing.“On the way, we were wearing a mask all the time, gel, washing our hands. Really, I don’t feel anything,” a released border crosser who tested positive told NBC News. The Honduran national continued traveling to North Carolina after finding out she had coronavirus.So far, the positivity rate for released border crossers in Brownsville, Texas, is 6.3 percent. The positivity rates for border crossers released in El Paso, Texas, and San Diego, California, are not known.On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki seemingly confirmed, again, that the administration continues to have no testing or quarantine requirements for border crossers being released into the U.S. interior.“Isolating, quarantining is a part of what our recommended health guidelines are and certainly part of what happens at the border when there are symptoms that are displayed and when testing is done,” Psaki said during a press briefing.In comparison, millions of Americans remain under strident restrictions and the Biden administration has slammed states such as Texas, Mississippi, and Florida for fully opening without restrictions.More than 30 states in the U.S. continue to have mask mandates, where Americans are required to wear masks in public places. Most states still have capacity limits on indoor spaces, limiting the number of customers and often hours that a business can operate in one day.In a state like California, for instance, out-of-state residents are advised not to travel to the state and at least two counties continue to require out-of-state residents to quarantine for 10 days when they do travel to the regions.Screenshot via the New York Times.Screenshot via the New York Times.Screenshot via the New York Times.Maryland, similarly, requires out-of-state travelers to get a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of their travel or undergo a 10-day quarantine after arriving in the state. New York continues to have low capacity limits on certain businesses it deems “non-essential” as well as mandatory masks in public.Washington, D.C., with some of the harshest lockdown orders, has continued to impose a 25 percent capacity limit on restaurants and limiting the number of people in an indoor gathering to 10 people. Nightclubs and libraries in Washington, D.C. remain closed.In Virginia, bars and restaurants must be closed by midnight.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), one of the first governors to get rid of all restrictions and limit local governments’ ability to impose restrictions, previously noted the Biden administration’s openness to the world’s migrants while advocating lockdowns for Americans.“It is a huge contradiction, and you can’t square wanting open borders for illegal aliens but then also restricting U.S. citizens from traveling around the country as they see fit, and I think the American people see the hypocrisy in that,” DeSantis said last month.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

214,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
215,"Penn State Dickinson Law Professor Martin Skladany is calling on Democrats to adopt a national “reverse primarying” strategy by temporarily switching party affiliation and infiltrating the Republican Party in order to defeat a “Trumpist GOP” which would otherwise “continue to win elections” and “maintain power.”Skladany’s proposal appeared in an opinion piece published in the Hill on Tuesday titled “Raid the Republican Party to Save the Party,” and opens by discouraging Democrats from awaiting an anticipated GOP self-destruction.“Democrats’ instinct after winning the White House and Congress in 2020 might be to stand back and let the Republican Party slowly self-destruct,” Skladany writes, but warns a “Trumpist GOP would continue to win elections, maintain power over certain states, and could regain control of the Senate or House in 2022.”Skladany calls on Democrats and independents to engage in “reverse primarying” to alter election results, claiming that “saving the Republican Party — and the rule of law” is equally their responsibility.“Democrats and independents need to cross over and vote in Republican primary elections. Such ‘reverse primarying’ could ensure that the general election at least would be a choice between candidates who believe in the sanctity of elections and good governance,” he adds. Skladany explains how his proposition would eradicate “the danger of extremism” through the efforts of non-Republicans. “Raiding a party’s primary is typically done to scupper a rival party in the general election by voting for their more extreme candidate. I propose the opposite: increasing a moderate Republican’s chances by cutting the far right off at the knees,” he explains. Noting that “some Republicans who value facts are defecting from their party, rather than fighting to take it back,” Skladany calls to “hobble” those he deems “extremists and conspiracy-theorists” within the Republican Party.“Even if Democrats could win every election — which they can’t — it is in their collective national interest to hobble far-right extremists and conspiracy-theorists in the GOP,” he writes. Skladany dismisses concerns the reverse could be applied to Democrats. “Should Democrats care if the same policy is applied to their party? No,” he writes, explaining, “Both moderate and left-leaning Democrats believe in democracy and the will of the people, even if there are sharp policy distinctions between them.” Furthermore, Skladany writes, “Any Republican at heart who registered as a Democrat might vote for more left-wing candidates to attempt to sink Democrats’ chances of success in the general election, yet this concern is likely not as important as the need for Democrats to ensure they don’t lose our freedoms through having despotic Republicans win elections.”Skladany suggests that non-Republicans “solidify the moderate Republican wing in many states” by asking to vote in a GOP primary or mailing in a form to change their party affiliation and then “go right back to voting for Democrats in the general election.” Admitting the scheme appears “drastic,” Skladany claims many Republicans do not respect the rule of law or are fearful to speak out.“This strategy may sound drastic,” he writes. “But the Republican Party is stuck with many politicians who apparently hold no fealty to the rule of law or some who may fear for their lives if they break with the charade they helped create.”Skladany presents several ways for Democrats “who recognize that the danger of Trumpism remains” to proceed. “They can attempt to change right-wing media, or try to sway extreme Republican voters and politicians directly through labor-intensive, one-on-one modes of communication,” he writes. “Or, they can assist moderate Republicans in taking back their party.”Skladany continues by calling on moderate Republicans who “truly want to end the widespread falsehoods and disregard for the rule of law” to “get on board.” Such a rush of “blue GOP voters” could lead to moderates winning Republican primaries in 2022, according to Skladany, which “could create a virtuous cycle that re-centers the right-wing news media and re-instills the protection of democracy within most of the [Republican] party.” Noting “serious concerns” about whether the GOP can be saved, Skladany concludes by reiterating that “non-Republicans now need to lend a vote.” The essay comes as the media has launched an all-out assault against Republicans, depicting them as Nazis and fascists.An essay published in the far-left Salon on Monday claimed the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was geared around completing the transformation of the Republican party into an “overtly authoritarian — even fascist — party” while accusing Republican voters of encouraging and supporting both racism and fascism.On Friday, the publication accused Republicans of resembling “good Germans” of the Nazi era — wishing to believe they are decent people while hiding behind “fictions of plausible deniability for the evils committed by their leader” —  and described today’s conservatism as seeking “friendly fascism” masked in an appeal to return to “traditional values.”Earlier this week, actress Rosanna Arquette threatened to boycott Hyatt hotels for hosting CPAC, which she described as a “fascist Nazi convention,” over the weekend, while fellow actress Alyssa Milano, among many on the left, floated a wild and baseless conspiracy that CPAC organizers deliberately fashioned the main stage to resemble a Nazi symbol.Hey Hyatt hotels. Highly inclusive ,does not mean hosting  people who are NOT  highly inclusive ,hosting a fascist Nazi convention is the antithesis of inclusiveness .you have made a grave error in judgement .the imminent Boycotts you are going  to feel for years to come.— ✌🏼rosanna arquette (@RoArquette) February 28, 2021Last month, after the Senate acquitted former President Trump of inciting the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, left-wing Hollywood celebrities lashed out at the 43 Republicans who voted to acquit, referring to them as “traitors” and “fascists.”Follow Joshua Klein on Twitter @JoshuaKlein.MediaPoliticsextremistsGOPRepublican Primaryright-wing mediaTrumpism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
216,"Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-GA) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Wednesday that the House Democrat majority has proven they are “happy to trample on Americans’ rights” with legislation to curb gun rights, religious freedom, and other liberties Americans hold dear.Ferguson, the chief deputy GOP whip, spoke to Breitbart News as Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Democrats are looking to pass several leftist bills in the following weeks. This includes H.R. 1, a bill that would radically transform America’s electoral system, a $15 minimum wage increase, several gun control measures, and the PRO Act that would act as a carveout to labor unions and threatens franchise businesses and the millions of workers they employ.Ferguson said that this reveals the Democrats’ “totalitarian” mindset.“House Democrats have proven that they are happy to trample on Americans’ individual rights, that they have no desire to compromise, and they are in a totalitarian mood. Republicans recognize this, just like every other American, we’re feeling the oppressive weight of the federal government right now, and there are way too many Americans who know that their government is against them right now,” the Georgia conservative told Breitbart News. “That has been very unifying for the House Republican Conference. We’re standing up for what’s right in this country, and that’s individual freedoms, a strong American economy, strong national defense, the things that really matter. But more importantly, people are furious that their individuality is being taken away from them.”Ferguson, also a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, lamented that Democrats would spend $350 billion to aid mostly fiscally-irresponsible state and local governments.He said, “They’re really not interested in helping Americans; they’re interested in helping themselves. If you look at where the dollars are going, you’re bailing out failed blue states; the funding formula for how the money is being allocated for the blue state bailouts. If your state that has managed well kept your economy open and keep people working and your state going, you’re being punished. If you lock everything down, sending seniors to their deaths in nursing homes, and closing businesses, you’re being rewarded in this bill. And that’s wrong, and it’s not fair.”Although there are reports of moderate Democrats resisting Pelosi’s legislative push, Ferguson said that the country has not seen many Democrats vote against the House leader.“We have not seen very many that have been willing to stand up. There’s a lot of talk; there’s a lot of conversation about being bipartisan and working with the other side; it comes down to votes. And they’re voting with Pelosi, and so what will happen going forward is yet to be seen,” he said.He added that if Republicans took back the House majority, they would work to put Americans’ interests first.“First of all, we would not do the things that Pelosi has done, such as putting a rule in place that says she can simply bring a bill from last Congress to the floor before April 1st without going through committee,” Ferguson said. “Think of all of the new members that have never had a chance to weigh in on the bill; the House is about being responsive to the people, because it’s closest to the people and the folks that have been elected particularly on the Democrat side, they are now showing to their constituents that they are not strong enough to stand up to Pelosi, the voice of their constituents do not have a voice in this process, and we would take the exact opposite approach. We’ll build legislation from the ground with a variety of voices with a new majority that truly has its eyes on putting America first.”Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

217,"Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R), who lifted most COVID-19 restrictions put in place on businesses in his state last week, has reaffirmed that he is committed to ending a statewide mask mandate should hospitalizations and the number of reported cases continue to fall.In an email to Breitbart News, Katie Beck, director of communications for Hutchinson, stated, “The Governor lifted all restrictions last Friday, converting the directives to guidelines. Restaurants can open to 100 percent capacity.”Beck, while noting that directives have now shifted to guidelines, also stated the mandate will remain in effect until the last day of March, but remained optimistic that Hutchinson could end the mandate after he works with health officials in the state to review “COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations” in Arkansas.“The mask mandate will remain in effect until March 31, 2021,” Beck told Breitbart News. “The Governor, in consultation with state health officials, will make a determination on whether to renew the mask mandate based on COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations in the state throughout the next month.”Last Friday, Hutchinson addressed residents in the state and announced the extension of the state’s public health emergency and mask mandate until the end of this month.At the conference, Hutchinson provided viewers with a mask mandate renewal evaluation graphic that highlighted his concerns and the two requirements needed to end the mandate:“If we meet these benchmarks, then the mask mandate will be lifted on March 31,” Hutchinson said during the press conference.Last week, Dr. Jose Romero, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Health, said the state has “shown significant progress with regard to number of cases and number of hospitalizations.”“We will still need to wear our masks, maintain social distancing, wash our hands, those are going to be essential in keeping this pandemic that is affecting our state under control,” Romero said of the restaurants retaining the right to operate at full capacity.According to sources close to the matter, Alabama will soon join several other states nationwide in removing its mandate requiring masks in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Governors in Texas and Mississippi announced earlier this week that they would lift their statewide mandates requiring face masks and allow businesses to return to 100 percent operating capacity.Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.HealthPoliticsArkansasAsa HutchinsoncoronavirusCOVID-19Face MasksJose Romero.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
218,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980. After his speech, the Republican nominee won a standing ovation and the endorsement of the 35,000-member union. (AP Photo/Charles W. Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

220,"Former president and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama hosted several events while in the White House that focused on Dr. Seuss and his iconic children’s books, six of which have been pulled from product because of alleged racist content.“On Read Across America Day, we partner with the National Education Association and mark the birthday of Theodor Geisel, whose beloved Dr. Seuss books still inspire children throughout the world to read,” Obama said in 2009.The former president was speaking to interns in 2015 when he claimed “pretty much all the stuff you need to know is in Dr. Seuss.”“We’re all the same, so why would we treat somebody differently just because they don’t have a star on their belly?” Barack Obama asked the group. “If I think about responsibility, I think about Horton sitting on the egg up in the tree while Lazy Mayzie’s flying off, doing whatever she wants. Know what I mean?”That same year Obama released a presidential proclamation for Read Across America Day, 2015. It said, in part:The works of Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known to us as Dr. Seuss, have sparked a love for reading in generations of students.  His whimsical wordplay and curious characters inspire children to dream big and remind readers of all ages that “a person’s a person no matter how small.”Fox News reported on another occasion when Barack Obama touted Dr. Seuss’ work:In 2018, during an interview with author and philanthropist Dave Eggers, Obama repeated the sentiment while comparing his work as a community organizer to his work as president and explaining how “the nature of human dynamics does not change from level to level.”The former president and first lady also embraced his children’s books on Easter and National Read Across America Day, when schools across the U.S. celebrate reading on Theodor Seuss Geisel’s March 2 birthday to commemorate the popular children’s author.The former first lady also celebrated the holiday by reading to children during National Read Across America Day events over the eight years the Obamas led the White House and as recently as May 2020.The organization in charge of Seuss’s legacy announced its decision to ban its own books in a statement released on Tuesday:Today, on Dr. Seuss’s Birthday, Dr. Seuss Enterprises celebrates reading and also our mission of supporting all children and families with messages of hope, inspiration, inclusion, and friendship.We are committed to action.  To that end, Dr. Seuss Enterprises, working with a panel of experts, including educators, reviewed our catalog of titles and made the decision last year to cease publication and licensing of the following titles:  And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, If I Ran the Zoo, McElligot’s Pool, On Beyond Zebra!, Scrambled Eggs Super!, and The Cat’s Quizzer.  These books portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong. “Dr. Seuss Enterprises listened and took feedback from our audiences including teachers, academics and specialists in the field as part of our review process,” the organization said in an interview with the Associated Press. “We then worked with a panel of experts, including educators, to review our catalog of titles.”Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comPoliticsSocial JusticeBarack ObamaDr. SeussMichelle ObamaNational Education Associationpresidential proclamationracismRead Across AmericaWhite House.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
221,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

227,"A report released Wednesday stated Rep. Tom Reed (R-NY) started to hire staff for a run for Governor of New York, showing he is serious about a 2022 challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).Andrew Cuomo has created an opportunity for Republicans to run for governor. Cuomo’s favorability rating dropped 22 points from last summer, according to a Harvard CAPS-Harris poll. Currently, Cuomo has three ongoing sexual harassment allegations.In an interview with Axios Wednesday, Reed was asked about his recent hirings:“We want to hit the ground running, so we’re talking to people that want to be part of that effort,” Reed told Axios. He quickly added he hasn’t yet made a final decision.“It’s all about making sure when we go — if we go — we’re 100% committed,” the congressman said. “We have been talking to people that want to go along this journey with us if we go down this path.”Reed has been a vocal opponent of Cuomo, both on Coronavirus and his sexual harassment allegations.In February on a call with reporters, Reed said, “Governor Cuomo, your days are numbered, and there’s leadership coming to Albany very soon.”In February, Reed appeared on Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends, calling for President Biden’s Justice Department to investigate Cuomo’s wrongful handling of nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic. Reed said:President Biden, you said you would use your Justice Department in an honorable way, objective way. We’re going to make sure the Justice Department does just that. And we’re going to use those tools of justice to make sure those 15,000 souls that died are going to be heard from and justice will be done.In June, Reed appeared on Fox News Channel’s Fox & Friends to talk about Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Reed said Cuomo:…is a great showboat, when it comes to holding press conferences. but when you look at his record on nursing homes, he ordered the death of at least 10,000 of our parents and grandparents by sending them, coronavirus-positive into the nursing home setting, exposing their residents and exposing the staff of those nursing homes to death by the COVID-19 virus. And I’ll just tell you, justice demands we get to the bottom of it.In May, Breitbart News received an exclusive comment from Reed: “The Governor’s uncertain and contradictory orders to nursing homes over the course of this crisis have been concerning,” Reed said. “It is clear these orders have put the lives of our most susceptible population in harm’s way. An investigation is needed to ensure this never happens again,”Reed is currently a six-term Congressman from New York, where he sits on the House Ways and Means Committee, is a ranking member of the subcommittee on Social Security, and sits on the Subcommittee on Health and Subcommittee on Worker & Family Support.On Tuesday, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) also announced he is “actively exploring” a run for Governor of New York in 2022 against Gov.

228,"Leftists caused a stir last week after spreading a false conspiracy theory that CPAC’s main stage depicted a Nazi symbol, but Design Foundry, the left-wing company that designed it, said it had “no idea that the design resembled any symbol, nor was there any intention to create something that did.”Design Foundry, which designed CPAC’s stage, has worked with left-wing organizations, such as MSNBC, Google, and the Biden Cancer Initiative, according to National Pulse. The outlet added that “of the $7,766.50 spent by Design Foundry workers on federal elections, just $140 – or 1.8 percent – went to Republican candidates.”Journalist Yashar Ali also noted that the firm’s owner is “very liberal and was so excited for Biden’s victory”:2. Also worth noting that many of her employees are liberalSo many of you decided to go after something without any reporting or knowledge about who was responsible for the designAnd before you ding her for working for CPAC, you try having an events business during a pandemic— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 3, 20214. And none of you will admit you got it wrong or apologize because in your minds it means you’re caving into Trump. Now an event company, which is a liberal owned and run small business, is associated with a horrific allegation that is based on conspiracies and no evidence.— Yashar Ali 🐘 (@yashar) March 3, 2021The stage design firm told Forward that it “had no idea that the design resembled any symbol, nor was there any intention to create something that did” and added that the design “intended to provide the best use of space, given the constraints of the ballroom and social distancing requirements.”Further, while the American Conservative Union (ACU) approved the design, the contract stated that the “designs, renderings, drawings, specifications, materials and other documents used or created as part of the proposal are owned by Design Foundry.”Ian Walters, director of communications for the ACU and CPAC, told the outlet that organizers will not use the design firm for future events.“ACU and CPAC have no interest in promoting antisemitism from our stage, whether it’s what happens on the stage or the design of the stage itself,” Walters said.“It’s clear that the company we retained designed a stage that has become an unwelcome distraction. As a result, we will not be using that company’s services going forward at future events,” he added.The main stage became a point of distraction as the event began after leftists took to Twitter, accusing CPAC of deliberately showcasing a Nazi symbol.“This is the stage at CPAC. THEY’RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO HIDE IT ANYMORE,” Alyssa Milano wrote in a post to her 2.9 million Instagram followers. “@hyatt, this is what’s happening in your building. @tedcruz, you stood on this stage”:A post shared by Alyssa Milano (@milano_alyssa)ACU chairman Matt Schlapp quickly dismissed the stage design conspiracies as “outrageous and slanderous”:Stage design conspiracies are outrageous and slanderous.

229,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
230,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) March 5, 2021Malinowski made about 90 financial trades in total, most of which were individual stocks, according to trade records his office disclosed.The congressman was mostly a buyer as the stock market tanked in March 2020 — 15 of the 22 trades the congressman said he made that month were purchases.Federal records indicated that Malinowski also made dozens of other stock trades during 2019 but failed to publicly disclose them within the legally required 30- to 45-day disclosure window — or ever file periodic transaction reports for them.Malinowski disclosed these 2019 stock trades in August as part of an annual personal financial-disclosure report that all members of Congress must file.Malinowski campaigned in 2019 on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics and increase transparency to ensure regular people — not corporations or special interests — have the strongest voices in Washington.”Since he entered Congress in 2019, Malinowski has sponsored several bills regarding financial transparency and political money. The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

232,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) favorability rating has dropped 22 points from last summer, according to a Harvard CAPS-Harris poll.The monthly online poll was conducted February 23-25 and surveyed 1,778 registered voters. The respondents were shown a list of names and asked to “indicate if you have a favorable or unfavorable view of that person or group.” The poll found Cuomo with a national net favorability rating of -11 percent.This is a 22 point decline from the last poll on Cuomo’s popularity in July 2020. Currently, Cuomo is plagued by three sexual harassment allegations.The survey was done after former staffer Lindsey Boylan accused Cuomo of sexual harassment. Boylan, who worked for Cuomo between March 2015 and October 2018 as his deputy secretary for economic development and as a special adviser, claimed he repeatedly harassed her while colleagues did nothing.Another poll released Monday from Hill-HarrisX revealed 71 percent of voters believe that Cuomo deliberately concealed the true number of coronavirus-related nursing home deaths in his state.PoliticsAndrew CuomoHarvard Harris PollLindsey BoylanNew Yorkpolls.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
233,"Alabama will become one of the next states to eliminate a government-imposed mandate that requires people wear masks in public, sources close to the matter told Breitbart News.A source familiar with state deliberations confirmed that as soon as Friday but definitely in the coming days. Alabama will join several other states nationwide in removing its mandate requiring masks in response to the coronavirus pandemic.GOP Gov. Kay Ivey’s office has not yet confirmed what sources familiar with the state’s planning and deliberations are, but a spokeswoman for Ivey told Breitbart News she was never a fan of mandates to begin with—a sign of the coming move.“All along, Governor Ivey has made clear that she prefers personal responsibility to government mandates. We are optimistic that our state is heading in the right direction, and we still have some work to be done. Governor Ivey will provide an update to the people of Alabama soon,” an Ivey spokeswoman said.The governor’s spokeswoman would not deny that she intends to lift the mask mandate on Friday, when the order is set to expire–but would not confirm the news either.While this statement does not confirm outright what Ivey has planned—again, sources familiar with the deliberations confirmed to Breitbart News that she is planning to scrap the mask mandate—this development is significant as it comes on the heels of several other states ditching their own mask mandates.Alabama Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth also released a statement on Wednesday urging Ivey to ditch the mask mandate once and for all:I urge Gov. Kay Ivey to immediately lift the statewide mask mandate and allow citizens and local officials the liberty to make the decisions that best fit their circumstances.See my full statement: pic.twitter.com/OYDN7DrGau— Will Ainsworth (@willainsworthAL) March 3, 2021Ivey could always back down ahead of the forthcoming announcement, and if she does it will be seen as cowering to democrats like President Joe Biden in Washington without following scientific advice and the leadership of other GOP-led states. Alabama Democrats are pressuring Ivey to cave to Biden and keep the mandate:Today AL reaches the grim milestone of 10,000 deaths from COVID-19– now is not the time to let our guard down. Our mask mandate is a small part of keeping Alabamians safe. We urge @GovernorKayIvey to follow CDC guidelines & not let the mandate expire. https://t.co/wTJL4UX4lt— Alabama Democrats (@aldemocrats) March 3, 2021This week, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves—both Republicans—announced they are lifting their states’ mask mandates. They join 14 other states—Florida, South Dakota, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee—in not having mask mandates.These red states’ decisions to ditch previously implemented mask mandates are a rebuke of Democrat President Joe Biden’s push to try to get Americans to wear masks for his first 100 days in office. Biden is not even through half of his first 100 days and already losing the confidence of a growing number of U.S. states rejecting his advice and guidance.In response to the announcements from Texas and Mississippi, Biden lashed out at the White House on Wednesday falsely calling the people in those states subhuman.“The last thing, the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime, everything’s fine, take off your mask, forget it,” Biden said about Abbott’s and Reeves’s moves.One of the sources familiar with Alabama’s forthcoming decision told Breitbart News that Biden attacking the people of Texas and Mississippi is playing a huge role in Alabama’s move to nuke the mask mandate. In other words, this person said, Biden’s attacks on American citizens are backfiring as more and more responsible government leaders across the country reject his authority and are moving away from his recommendations as he shows disdain for Americans from states that did not vote for him for president.“Joe Biden has fewer functioning brain cells than a Neanderthal and continues to listen to clowns like Fauci, who’s been wrong at every turn, but he’s got the nerve to criticize states who abandon mandates that aren’t supported by science?

234,"Book-burning is back.The left has begun to ban the classics, including Homer’s Odyssey, as well as great works of American literature, such as Nathanial Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter.J.K. Rowling, of Harry Potter fame, is off limits for her alleged “transphobia,” and Dr. Seuss’s estate canceled six of his books for “hurtful and wrong” portrayals. (Perhaps Thing 1 and Thing 2 felt objectified.)Somehow, the foundational works of radical Marxism never seem to be on the list of books to be canceled.No reasonable person, and certainly no one claiming intellectual credentials, would argue that Karl Marx’s works should be banned. But some of them certainly satisfy the new criteria.Marx’s essay “On the Jewish Question,” for example, is a staple of college courses on political philosophy, because it summarizes his view of the limits of political freedom, and is easier to digest than his mammoth Capital. Yet the essay is also crudely antisemitic, which is barely mitigated by the fact that Marx himself was Jewish.Here is some of what Marx had to say about Jews (original emphasis):Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew.What is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.Very well then! Emancipation from huckstering and money, consequently from practical, real Judaism, would be the self-emancipation of our time.…The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange.…Once society has succeeded in abolishing the empirical essence of Judaism – huckstering and its preconditions – the Jew will have become impossible, because his consciousness no longer has an object, because the subjective basis of Judaism, practical need, has been humanized, and because the conflict between man’s individual-sensuous existence and his species-existence has been abolished.The social emancipation of the Jew is the emancipation of society from Judaism.National Socialism would go on to attempt to “emancipate” society from the Jews, murdering 6 million.In the constant debate over whether the Founders of the United States, and the liberty they conceived, are to be rejected because some owned slaves, there is little discussion about how a basic text of Marxism is largely an antisemitic screed.There was a time when Marx’s works were banned. But the McCarthy era is to be studied as a cautionary tale, not as a precedent to be followed.Sadly, many of the institutions that once stood up against hysterical anti-communism are leading the “cancel culture” today — starting with the universities, which purport to be safe havens for intellectual inquiry. Instead they have fashioned themselves as a vanguard: what began with Halloween costumes at Yale has engulfed the country.The right thing to do with texts that are tainted by prejudice is to engage with them critically. That was once considered both praiseworthy and interesting.When I was at Harvard in the late 1990s, for example, the campus Hillel House staged a version of Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice that attempted to grapple with some of the antisemitic features of the character of Shylock. The Jewish students understood there was intrinsic merit to the play; they wanted to see if it could still be salvaged.The censors of the left need to be held to the same standard that they use to judge, and to cancel, others — so they can see how absurd censorship is.Some of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement have proudly touted themselves as Marxists, for example; they should be asked if their Marxism led to protests in which synagogues were vandalized in Los Angeles and Kenosha.After all, few of the authors being canceled by the “woke” are as explicitly hateful as Marx, their original inspiration.Joel B.

235,"In 1998, the National Education Association (NEA) — the country’s largest teachers union — linked arms with Dr. Seuss to promote “Read Across America Day.”Education World reported on the first events designed to make reading fun:Those were among the events held on the first ever Read Across America Day, March 2, 1998. Read Across America Day — which also just happens to be Dr. Seuss’s birthday — is sponsored by the National Education Association, and NEA officials estimated that at least half a million educators and millions of children were part of that first celebration. They were joined by celebrities, athletes, governors, mayors, firefighters, politicians, judges, and others.Amid the rush to cancel the works of Theodor Seuss “Ted” Geisel, the NEA at one time could not heap enough praise on the man’s works.“People of all ages love Dr. Seuss,” then NEA president Bob Chase said in 2008, the news site said.“He epitomizes a love of children and learning. Read Across America Day is truly one of the largest celebration of literacy this country has. Dr. Seuss would be proud.”According to the Education World, Chase said, “We are calling for every child in every school in every community to be in the company of a book on Read Across America Day, in celebration of Dr. Seuss’s birthday.”In 2012, the NEA promoted the Dr. Seuss book “The Lorax,” which was being released in theaters as a movie on the same day.“Every year on NEA’s Read Across America Day, the imaginations of children across the country are ignited when they open up a good book,” then NEA President Dennis Van Roekel said, the union reported. “‘The Lorax’ is not only entertaining to read, but it also highlights the importance of protecting our air, land and water. Our students deserve to learn in a safe, healthy environment.”“Dr. Seuss not only teaches kids about taking care of our planet with ‘The Lorax,’ he helps them learn the fundamentals of reading through all of his books,” movie actor Danny DeVito said. “I’m so happy to be a part of Read Across America’s efforts to spread these timeless messages to children throughout the country.”Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

236,"Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) blasted H.R.1, which the U.S. House of Representatives is considering on Wednesday, as the “Socialist Democrat Election Fraud Enhancement Act,” explaining the measure will do “great damage” to the security of America’s election system nationwide.In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday, Brooks highlighted the dangers of H.R.1, which is more commonly known as the “For the People Act.”“I call it the ‘Socialist Democrat Election Fraud Enhancement Act. It will do great damage to the reliability and security of America’s election system,” he said, listing off some of the specific changes the measure would make.“The socialists seek to mandate no-fault absentee ballots, which are the tool of choice for vote thieves. They seek to eliminate the photo identification requirement and, by the way, when the federal government does it, that eliminates all state laws to the contrary,” Brooks said, explaining that it would repeal “who knows how many state statutes that protect the security of our election system.”Overall, the act largely federalizes elections, taking the vast majority of power away from the states.“It, to a very large degree, federalizes and micromanages the election process administered by the states. It implemented, as I mentioned, some of the worst changes in election rules that occurred during the 2020 election. It requires states to restore the ability of felons to vote the moment they’re out of prison, regardless of uncompleted parole, probation, or restitution requirements or what states may believe is the appropriate restoration of voting rights for convicted felons,” he continued.It is essential, Brooks told Breitbart News, for Republicans to stop the “socialist Democrats” from placing in federal law the “very systemic flaws” that occurred during the highly contentious 2020 presidential election.Others, Brooks said, would be “wise” to copy Alabama, which received an “A” rating from the group Concerned Women for America’s election integrity scoreboard for its rules for its requirements for voter identification, handling of mail-in voting, and more.The congressman said the Alabama state legislature has enacted “good laws” on absentee ballots, requiring voters to provide proof of absenteeism, as well as requirements for photo identification, which Brooks said is “probably the number one way to minimize voter fraud.”The Alabama legislature, he added, has done a “very good job” on election integrity measures, overall.“That’s why we’re ranked number one in election security, and we are a model that other states and the federal government would be wise to copy,” Brooks said.Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Heritage Foundation’s Election Law Reform Initiative, has described the measure as an “800-page monstrosity” that would ultimately result in the “federal takeover of the running of elections.”“If you’re a state like Alabama or Texas that has a voter ID law, you might as well forget it, because this federal law would override all state voter ID laws so they’re now unenforceable,” he said during a January appearance on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily.According to Politico, the first votes for H.R.1 are expected to begin between noon at 1:30 Eastern.Breitbart News reported yesterday that a Texas judge and three other people were indicted by a grand jury on 150 counts related to voter fraud during the 2018 Medina County Primary Election.Politicsabsentee ballotselection integrityFor the People ActH.R. 1Hans von SpakovskyMo BrooksOn the Hillvoter fraudVoter ID.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
237,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

238,"President Joe Biden joined the “cancel culture” this week by dropping Dr. Seuss from “Read Across America Day” after left-wing critics complained about the author’s early caricatures and race-neutral beliefs. But Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who leads the Democratic Party in the Senate, is among the many members of his party who have used Dr. Seuss to make political points. In 2013, for example, Schumer used Dr. Seuss to argue for the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.Schumer cited the popular Dr. Seuss book Green Eggs and Ham, which Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) had read aloud on the Senate floor as he attempted to block the implementation of Obamacare. Schumer argued that like the central character in Green Eggs and Ham, who resisted the dish until he actually tried it, Americans would enjoy Obamacare once they were forced to enroll in it:I was also surprised that he used the book Green Eggs and Ham as he read to his daughters. Because anyone who knows that book knows that the moral of that book I: try something before you condemn it. You might actually like it! The main character in Green Eggs and Ham resisted eating green eggs and ham. Maybe if he were a Senator he’d speak on the floor for 21 hours.

239,"Public health officials from President Joe Biden’s administration pleaded Wednesday for Americans to keep wearing masks in states like Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott (R) lifted the statewide mask mandate Tuesday.“Every individual is empowered to do the right thing here regardless of what the states decide,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a briefing with reporters Wednesday morning.Walensky fielded a question about Abbott’s decision to lift the mask mandate in Texas.“I think we at the CDC have been very clear that now is not the time to release all restrictions,” she said.Texas and Mississippi on Tuesday joined a handful of Republican-led states that no longer have statewide mandates to wear a mask.But Walensky argued that the next month or two was “pivotal” to stop the spread of the virus as vaccinations get distributed.Biden officials acknowledged during the briefing that people were getting tired of the coronavirus restrictions, but urged them to keep wearing masks.“Stamina has worn thin; fatigue is winning, and the exact measures we have taken to stop the pandemic are all too often being flagrantly ignored,” Walensky said.Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Andy Slavitt said Biden was “100 percent” behind the advice of Dr. Walensky.“Even though it’s counterintuitive, it’s actually the most important time for people to make sure we run through the tape and finish that up,” he said.HealthPoliticsScienceAndy SlavittGreg AbbottRochelle Walensky.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Andrew Cuomo must resign now.”On Sunday, Cuomo responded to the sexual harassment allegations by stating women “misinterpret” his “banter”:At work sometimes I think I am being playful and make jokes that I think are funny. I do, on occasion, tease people in what I think is a good natured way. I do it in public and in private. You have seen me do it at briefings hundreds of times.

To the extent anyone felt that way, I am truly sorry about that.”The disgraced Cuomo first came under scrutiny in February, however, when one of his top aides admitted that his office withheld the number of New York nursing home deaths related to the coronavirus in an attempt to protect his administration from federal investigation and political consequences.As Breitbart News reported Monday, four Democrat governors enacted nursing home policies similar to those of Cuomo during the pandemic: Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), Gavin Newsom (D-CA), Phil Murphy (D-NJ), and Tom Wolf (D-PA).“As of March 1, 2021, only Cuomo’s office has faced accusations of manipulating the data on nursing home resident deaths by excluding the numbers of those who died after being transferred to hospitals,” Breitbart News reported.PoliticsAndrew CuomoNursing HomesPlanned Parenthoodsexual harassmentUltraVioletWomen's March.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
241,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
242,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980. After his speech, the Republican nominee won a standing ovation and the endorsement of the 35,000-member union. (AP Photo/Charles W. Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
243,"Posing for a White House Christmas photo, the young Senate staffer in his navy-blue suit looks to be the picture of a conventional D.C. politico.Except for one thing: the young man gets his kicks watching men rape infants.“Babies are some of my biggest turn-ons,” he wrote, according to court documents. “Young rape…I love all that.”In case you missed the story, D.C. Metropolitan police arrested 27-year-old Ruben Verastigui in February on federal child porn charges. The Republican operative stands accused of trading and receiving videos of infant rape and inviting others to join him in Washington to sexually assault kids.I should have told you to brace yourself. But to be honest, I’m tired of soft shoeing around this grotesque violence. We should be shouting it from the rooftops. Pedophilia is a national epidemic. And we should leave no stone unturned in a national, nonpartisan campaign to bring its child victims justice.Like everyone reading this, I’d heard about child pornography, child sex trafficking, and incest. We all know it happens, but the extent to which it happens, I had no idea.My blinders came off a few years ago when I started fostering abandoned and abused infants.One was a chubby-cheeked baby with a mop of dark hair; let’s call him Eric.Eric was healthy and strong, unlike many of the babies I’d cared for.“Why is he in the system?” I asked the social worker.“His mother is eleven,” she said.“What about the grandparents?” I asked.“Grandma is the reason the girl got pregnant. Grandma offered her to men for money and gifts.”The social worker shrugged – she’d seen this before – but I stood there with my mouth open. A mother had trafficked her own daughter.I wish this were a unique situation, but we routinely meet these victims in our pro bono Children’s Law Clinic, too. One of the kids we helped rescue was being sold for sex by a close family member, just as had been done to Eric’s mom. Thank goodness for a relative who had the insight to make the phone call that helped save her life.According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, every nine minutes, officers substantiate a claim of child sexual abuse. That’s 150 children each day, and those are only the known, substantiated cases. Children living without either parent (foster children) are ten times more likely to be sexually abused than children living with both biological parents.My four-year-old is scared of green, three-eyed monsters. “Don’t worry, little buddy, monsters aren’t real,” I say as I tuck him into bed. But they are. Real monsters look like us, they socialize and work with us. They coach little league, wait in car lines, and sit next to us in the pews on Sunday mornings. Ruben Verastigui in his polished suit working on Capitol Hill is a monster.Verastigui, like all criminally accused, has a constitutional right to an attorney. He’ll receive due process and have full access to justice with pleadings, filings, and appeals. His rights will be protected at every stage.The double injury suffered by abused children is that they have no such legal rights. At Gen Justice, we believe they should. When infants and kids enter the court cases that define the rest of their lives, they often do it without the attorney representation necessary to guarantee justice. Congress can and should remedy this injustice by requiring lawyers for all child victims.

244,"Day 43 into the Biden presidency, his cabinet is still half-empty because of the slow start in confirmations.President Biden has made 23 nominees to cabinet-level positions. Only 13 of those have been confirmed by the Senate, making just a little over half of the positions filled. This is shaping up to be the slowest start to the naming of cabinet positions in modern history.Among them, “15 core nominees to lead federal agencies, 10 have been confirmed, or about two thirds. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, about a month into their first terms, the previous four presidents had 84% of their core Cabinet picks confirmed,” according to an Associated Press report.The report continued:Matt Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that tracks presidential transitions, said federal departments tend to act more conservatively around decision-making and shifting policies without the top brass in place.“Missing the top person means that it’s pretty difficult to actually address the very big questions and to make big changes,” he said. “And there’s a natural conservatism in place when people don’t know yet what the top person is going to really want.”On Tuesday, Neera Tanden withdrew her nomination for director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Tanden was facing bipartisan opposition from senators because of past comments she made on her Twitter feed.“I am writing to you to withdraw my nomination for Director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Tanden wrote in a statement. “Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities.”PoliticsBiden cabinetJoe BidenNeera TandenOffice of Management and Budget.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
245,"President Joe Biden’s administration still has no strict national quarantine policy for migrants who test positive for the coronavirus, according to the White House.White House press secretary Jen Psaki responded to recent reporting from NBC News showing migrants who tested positive for the virus were not prevented by the federal government from traveling into the United States.She said quarantining migrants who were tested positive was “part of what happens” but did not confirm that a policy had been set.“Isolating, quarantining is a part of what our recommended health guidelines are and certainly part of what happens at the border when there are symptoms that are displayed and when testing is done,” Psaki said.She said that testing migrants for the coronavirus were done at the state and local levels with help from the federal government.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and other Senate Republicans, demanded answers from the Biden administration last month on their release of border crossers without coronavirus testing requirements after Breitbart News pressed White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki.Although state and local officials have demonstrated efforts to get migrants released into the United States tested, it is clear that there is little federal effort to ensure that migrants infected with the virus are quarantined or isolated for a period of time.Cotton accused the Biden administration Tuesday of allowing a “superspreader event” to take place at the border, despite the president claiming that there was no crisis.President Biden's border crisis is a superspreader event. https://t.co/IwphAnqrzn— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) March 3, 2021HealthImmigrationPoliticsbordercoronavirusJoe BidenTom Cotton.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
246,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
247,"A third high-ranking Michigan official has been paid off in exchange for resigning and signing a confidentiality clause, a report revealed.Michigan’s former Unemployment Insurance Agency Director Steve Gray was paid $85,872 in a separation agreement signed in November 2020, M Live reported.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) was asked if any of these separation agreements constitute “hush money.”“I really bristle at that characterization,” Whitmer said. “There are terms to it, and you can’t share every term to it.”Under the agreement, he agreed to resign and “release all claims” against the state in a confidentiality clause.Gray’s severance pay represents pay from November 6, 2020, to June 1, 2021.“Both parties agree that they will not make any statements or take any action disparaging the reputation of the other, whether written or oral,” the separation agreement states, in addition to the confidentiality clause.The agreement is similar to another where former State Health Department Director Robert Gordon was paid $150,000 in exchange for signing a confidentiality agreement requiring him to stay quiet about his abrupt departure.Another high-ranking official, Sarah Etsy, was paid $12,000 in her separation agreement in January. Etsy worked as the senior deputy director for policy and planning administration for Michigan’s department of health and human services.Whitmer claimed there were no improprieties against Gordon when he left, even when she quickly appointed Elizabeth Hertel to take his place.Republicans, who were concerned about these separation agreements, met Tuesday afternoon to discuss the agreements.

248,"Democrats are moving to prioritize radical policy proposals, tackling amnesty, gun control, a $15 minimum wage, and H.R.1, which would ultimately lead to the federalization of elections.According to Politico, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) this week previewed her intention to “turn her chamber the next two weeks into a factory for Democratic priorities.”“They’ll move everything from election reform to a policing overhaul to gun control, plus women’s and union rights and a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers,” the outlet reported.The House is voting on one of their most radical proposals Wednesday,  H.R. 1, or the “For the People Act,” which Republicans warn would federalize elections, stripping states of their power to enact their own statutes requiring photo ID and other basic requirements.“It’s a federal micromanagement of the election process, and everything that folks on the left want to reduce the integrity [and] the security of the election process is in there,” Hans von Spakovsky, manager of the Heritage Foundation’s Election Law Reform Initiative, explained during a January appearance on Breitbart News Daily.“If you’re a state like Alabama or Texas that has a voter ID law, you might as well forget it, because this federal law would override all state voter ID laws so they’re now unenforceable,” he added.Conservatives pushed back against the measure even prior to the contentious and controversial 2020 presidential election, releasing a memo detailing the left’s objectives in the proposal in 2019. The measure, they said:House Democrats have also pointed to their intention of pursuing gun control measures, with House Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) referring to the current effort as merely a “first step.”Far-left Democrats are also pursuing enacting a $15 minimum wage, as well as a series of immigration bills, which has put some moderate Democrats out of ease.“You just can’t say, ‘Yeah, yeah, let everybody in’ — because then we’re affected down there at the border,” Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX), who represents a border district, told Axios.“Nancy Pelosi has driven House Democrats further off the deep end during the Biden Administration and continues to prioritize their socialist agenda over helping people in need,” National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Spokesman Mike Berg said in a statement.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview Tuesday that it is key for Republicans to continue to highlight the radical proposals Democrats chase and embrace ahead of the 2022 elections.“We need to highlight the things that the socialist Democrats stand for. And I believe they’re repugnant to the vast majority of the American citizenry, and as such, 2022 ought to be a landslide year for Republicans in the House and in the Senate,” he predicted, expressing hope that the momentum would carry into 2024.“We [Republicans] just need to let the Democrats do what they’re doing, publicize what they’re doing, fight it, and defeat it when we can, and make sure the public understands how egregious and how radical the socialist Democrat policies are,” he added.2nd AmendmentEconomyPoliticsH.R. 1House Democratsillegal immigrationNancy PelosiNRCC.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

251,"The Republican Governors Association (RGA) is seeking to determine the extent of coordination between Democrat Govs. Andrew Cuomo (NY) and Gretchen Whitmer (MI) on the controversial policy of putting coronavirus-infected patients into nursing homes to recuperate.The group filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with Whitmer Tuesday to obtain communications between the two state executives and their aides.According to the RGA:Last month, it was revealed that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lied to the American people during the COVID-19 crisis. Governor Cuomo and his staff tried to cover up the actual number of those who died because of his policies. He forced nursing homes to accept patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19.Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued a similar directive even though experts warned early on that such policies would put in danger those who required our attention and care. And as The Detroit News pointed out in an Aug. 5, 2020 editorial, Governor Whitmer refused to back down even as other governors changed course. Governor Whitmer even joined forces with Governor Cuomo in an attempt to deflect from their own bad policies by claiming that simply asking for transparency and additional information amounted to politicizing a crisis.Dave Rexrode, RGA executive director, requested “any and all” communications between the two governors and/or their staffs “regarding nursing homes and long-term care facilities” from August 15 to September 15, 2020.In August, the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) sent requests to both governors, as well as two others, seeking data related to coronavirus-linked nursing home deaths.Cuomo and Whitmer issued a joint statement accusing the DOJ of partisan motivations.“This is nothing more than a transparent politicization of the Department of Justice in the middle of the Republican National Convention,” Whitmer and Cuomo, who is embroiled in his own nursing home death scandal, said, according to the Daily Gazette.“It’s no coincidence the moment the Trump administration is caught weakening the CDC’s COVID-19 testing guidelines to artificially lower the number of positive cases, they launched this nakedly partisan deflection,” the duo said.“At least 14 states — including Kentucky, Utah and Arizona — have issued similar nursing home guidance, all based on federal guidelines, yet the four states listed in the DOJ’s request have a Democratic governor,” Whitmer and Cuomo claimed.The Michigan House Oversight Committee held a hearing last week on Whitmer’s policy, and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) refused to answer questions.“We asked them to testify, we asked them last week. We really wanted them to testify, because there are questions that need to be answered. They refused to testify. They sent us this letter instead,” state Rep. Steve Johnson (R) told the committee.The committee chairman indicated the letter claimed MDHHS has “the greatest data out there,” but did not share any of it.“I’m just a simple guy, but in my mind if you have the best data out there, wouldn’t you share it with people?” he asked.Kyle Olson is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Have you determined the exact cause of death and is there a homicide investigation?”Wray responded that the investigation into his death is “ongoing,” but did not say whether the cause of his death has been determined yet:There is an ongoing investigation into his death. I have to be careful at this stage because it’s ongoing… . I certainly understand and respect and appreciate the keen interest in what happened to him. After all he was here protecting all of you and as soon as our information that we can appropriately share we want to be able to do that, but at the moment the investigation is still ongoing.Grassley pressed him further on whether the FBI has determined the cause of death, which Wray sidestepped again.“We can’t yet disclose cause of death at this stage,” he said. “We are not at a point where we can disclose or confirm the cause of death.”Cruz tried again: “You told Senator Grassley the FBI at this point is not in the position to confirm a cause of death. Is there any information that the FBI can share with the American people about what we know of the circumstances surrounding his tragic death?”Wray only said his death could “appropriately” be categorized as a “line of duty death.”“Although I certainly understand and appreciate the keen interest in it for all of the reasons we have discussed at the moment other than to say the Capitol Police is of course categorized it I think appropriately as a line of duty death there’s nothing really that I could share right now,” he said. Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook. PoliticsBrian SicknickCapitolCapitol HillChristopher WrayChuck GrassleyFBITed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall. As a result, more Americans would be cut off from payments,” the article concluded.ImmigrationPoliticsPre-ViralcoronavirusIllegal Aliensstimulus checksTed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
257,"Senate Democrats are preparing to fully underwrite COBRA subsidies for laid-off workers in their version of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which would also aid illegal immigrants, according to a report from Politico.After the House passed the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill on partisan lines, Senate Democrats are now preparing their version of the mammoth legislation.Politico reported that Senate Democrats want to increase the COBRA subsidies to help laid-off workers so that they can continue to stay on their employer-provided healthcare plan rather than shop for a plan on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges.The House version of the legislation allowed for subsidies to pay for 85 percent of COBRA premiums to laid-off workers, including illegal immigrants.The Senate Democrat version would reportedly increase the subsidies to 100 percent of premiums, which would cost roughly $15 billion.Politico wrote that this potential increase in COBRA subsidies resulted from lobbying pressure by unions, employers, and the healthcare industry. The outlet reported:Early in the coronavirus emergency, an unlikely alliance of unions, employers and the health industry banded together to push Congress to subsidize these plans when it looked like the pandemic-related layoffs might seriously dent the lucrative market.The effort went to the back-burner as some jobs recovered and the pandemic closures hit restaurants and the retail industry the hardest — sectors that are less likely to offer workplace insurance. Still, it stayed on the priority list for unions and employers.Republicans in the House offered amendments to stop COBRA subsidies from going to illegal immigrants; however, Democrats blocked their proposals.Rep. Ross Fulcher (R-ID) said in February, “My amendment would ensure that taxpayer dollars – or tax credits for COBRA coverage in this legislation – would only goes to those with lawful immigration status.”WATCH:@RepRussFulcher introduces an amendment to prevent illegal immigrants from getting taxpayer-funded healthcare through COBRA subsidies in Democrats' massive bill. pic.twitter.com/UOQuKCekho— Mark Bednar (@MarkBednar) February 10, 2021WATCH: @repkevinhern introduces his amendment to ensure that illegal immigrants would not be eligible for COBRA subsidies in Democrats' bill. pic.twitter.com/C9kq2w809W— Mark Bednar (@MarkBednar) February 11, 2021Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

258,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
259,"A bipartisan group of U.S. Senators — led by Todd Young (R-IN) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) — introduced legislation Wednesday that would strip President Joe Biden of war powers by repealing both the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for the use of military force (AUMF) in the Middle East.The move comes in response to Biden’s recent airstrikes in eastern Syria, which were launched without congressional approval. The decision to launch the strike followed the shelling of an Iraqi military base that houses U.S. troops. The rocket attack left one civilian contractor dead and nine others wounded. A U.S. service member was among those hurt.“Last week’s airstrikes in Syria show that the executive branch, regardless of party, will continue to stretch its war powers,” Kaine, a member of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement obtained by Politico. “Congress has a responsibility to not only vote to authorize new military action, but to repeal old authorizations that are no longer necessary.”“Congress has been operating on autopilot when it comes to our essential duties to authorize the use of military force,” Young told the news outlet. “The fact that authorities for both of these wars are still law today is illustrative of the bipartisan failure of Congress to perform its constitutionally-mandated oversight role.”Co-sponsors of the bill include: Sens. Chris Coons (D-DE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Mike Lee (R-UT), and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL).Kaine previously expressed frustration with the Biden administration’s decision not to brief Congress on the strike.“The American people deserve to hear the Administration’s rationale for these strikes and its legal justification for acting without coming to Congress,” Kaine said. “Offensive military action without congressional approval is not constitutional absent extraordinary circumstances. Congress must be fully briefed on this matter expeditiously.”State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters during a regular press briefing that Iranian-made and -supplied rockets have been used in many such attacks but wouldn’t say if rockets from Tehran were involved in the Erbil attack, stating they will await the conclusions of Iraq’s investigation before attributing blame.Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told reporters that the United States will respond but reserves the right do so in a time and manner of its choosing.“We will respond in a way that’s calculated, on our timetable and using a mix of tools seen and unseen,” she said. “What we will not do — and what we’ve seen in the past — is lash out and risk an escalation that plays into the hands of Iran by further destabilizing Iraq.”The UPI contributed to this report. National SecurityPoliticsJoe BidenSyriaTim KaineTodd Youngwar powers.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
260,"We asked Facebook’s Oversight Board to end the censorship of former President Trump and allow him back onto the platform. We told its “Oversight Board” that the decision to suspend Trump is an affront to free speech and transparency. The Oversight Board is empowered by Facebook to review and overturn Facebook’s censorship decisions.Facebook and Big Tech censorship of former President Trump is an attack on the free speech of every American. Simply put: Big Tech must stop censoring conservatives in their effort to help Joe Biden.(The censorship isn’t just about Trump. I’ve been locked out of Twitter for six weeks over a tweet previously found not to be in violation of Twitter’s rules.)Here is the Judicial Watch comment:Dear Board Members:Judicial Watch is a non-profit, non-partisan educational foundation, promoting transparency, accountability and integrity in government and fidelity to the rule of the law. It is fair to say that Judicial Watch is the largest government transparency organization in the United States.The Oversight Board should quickly reverse Facebook’s panicked decision to suspend then-President Trump from its platform. The decision is an affront to the First Amendment protections of free speech, peaceable assembly, and the right to petition the government.There is no credible evidence that President Trump either morally or legally incited violence. He was resoundingly acquitted by the United States Senate after the impeachment “prosecutors” failed to produce credible evidence he incited violence. For Facebook to suggest President Trump incited violence and that complaints about the administration of an election could incite violence is a political position aligned with the Left and political opponents of President Trump and his supporters. The “Trump standard” Facebook would set for speech on its platform would, if fairly applied, limits core political speech of every user on every public policy topic. Specifically, Left partisans now seek to effectively criminalize those who advocate for free, fair, and secure elections. Facebook’s ban of President Trump provides moral cover to this attack on the rights of tens of millions of Americans.There is no apolitical process for censoring or even “fact checking” political speech, and Facebook’s policies should reflect this reality – on topics ranging from election reform to, as the Oversight Board previously found, COVID debates. (The Internet and platforms such as Facebook are increasingly seen as a public accommodation. In Washington, DC, restricting access to public accommodations based on political affiliation is prohibited under the DC Human Rights Act.)The brazen deplatforming of President Trump is chilling the speech of other Facebook users, and Internet users generally, who fairly worry about Facebook censoring and deplatforming them.Facebook’s censorship also undermines government and related transparency. Politicians who communicate their views on Facebook are providing transparency and information that otherwise may not be available to voters and citizens. Deplatforming President Trump certainly chills the speech of other politicians and deprives citizens of useful insights about these politicians and government policies.PoliticsTechFacebookfree speechJudicial WatchTech Censorship.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
261,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

262,"Florida, which has received a steady stream of criticism from Democrats and the establishment media for rolling back coronavirus-related restrictions, allowing businesses to open and operate, has fewer new cases of the Chinese coronavirus per capita in the last seven days than New York, a blue state that has continued to embrace some of the most stringent restrictions in the country.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who described the state as an “oasis of freedom” during an appearance at CPAC in Orlando, Florida, last week, promised during Tuesday’s State of the State that he will continue to ensure that the state remains open for business, even as leftists pressure the Sunshine State to put restrictions in place.“Friends, legislators, Floridians, lend me your ears: We will not let anybody close your schools, we will not let anybody take your jobs and we will not let anybody close your businesses!” DeSantis declared during the address.Texas is among the latest states to completely reopen. On Tuesday, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced that he is rolling back the restrictions on businesses as well as the statewide mask mandate, drawing ire from leftists such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).“This endangers the entire country and beyond,” she said upon his announcement.However, leftist critiques may be misguided —  particularly in the critiques of Florida, which has seen fewer new cases of the virus per capita than New York, which Democrats have continued to champion for its response to the virus.According to March 2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, Florida reported 24.7 cases of the virus per 100,000 in the last seven days, or 37,073.CDC data does not include New York City in the Empire State’s overall data. Nevertheless, Florida fares better than both the state, which excludes the city, as well as the city itself.New York State, excluding New York City, has reported 31.4 cases per 100,000 in the last seven days, or 24,290. New York City has reported 48.6 cases per 100,000 in the last seven days, or 28,567.Florida has seen fewer cases per capita in both scenarios and reported over 15k fewer cases in the last seven days than the entirety of New York State, despite rolling back restrictions months ago and never implementing a statewide mask mandate.“There are not a whole lot of Floridians who are itching to move from Florida to lockdown states, but there are thousands and thousands of people who are seeking to leave the lockdowns behind for the greener pastures in Florida,” DeSantis said during his State of the State address.“We have long been known as the Sunshine State – but, given the unprecedented lockdowns we have witnessed in other states, I think the Florida sun now serves as a beacon of light to those who yearn for freedom,” he added.HealthPoliticsSciencecoronavirusFloridaNew YorkRon DeSantis.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
263,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

267,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
268,"Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) revealed Tuesday the moderate wing of the Democrat Party is “not interested” in their leadership’s strategy of passing the hard left’s agenda items without trying to attain Republican support.“We’re not interested in just passing a bunch of partisan bills that sit in the Senate without action,” Gottheimer said. “There’s a feeling among many of us that we’re here to govern. The issues are far too important, and it will take bipartisan work to make it happen.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) chamber is ready to focus on new legislative pushes after its passage of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which may include LGBTQ priorities, law and order reform, women’s compensation, the Violence Against Women Act, the Dream Act, an amnesty bill, voting rights, and two gun bills.Pushing through the hard left’s agenda in the House of Representatives is easier than in the Senate, where at least 10 Republicans are needed to pass legislation.“You disincentivize action when you legislate that way,” Gottheimer, a co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, said.The alternative would be for Democrats in the House to work on bills through the committee process and allow Republican amendments and negotiations, giving responsibility to committee chairs to write legislation that can get bipartisan support instead of bills that simply include what progressives want.Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-TX) agreed, saying, “We should be as bold and ambitious as our caucus will bear in the House,” and added, “We should not negotiate against ourselves.”But one House leader pointed to polls instead of the voting rolls to defend the approach.“We believe these bills enjoy overwhelming support among Democrats, Republicans and independents among the American people — frankly, we don’t know why that support, particularly in terms of Republican support, doesn’t translate to the members of the House or the Senate,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters Tuesday.The dissonance between the moderate Democrats and their leadership must resolve itself by engaging in bipartisanship or accomplishing the president’s campaign promises.An analogous situation played out Friday when the House voted on the coronavirus package in the dead of night by a vote of 219 to 212 with no Republican support and two Democrats voting against it.Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-OR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) crossed party lines and voted to reject the bill known as the American Rescue Plan, which only allocates nine percent of the bill’s funding towards fighting the coronavirus.Golden said in a statement, “Unfortunately, the path congressional leaders have chosen goes far beyond these key provisions, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.”“After supporting $4 trillion in emergency COVID relief in 2020, I won’t support trillions more in funding that is poorly targeted or in many cases not necessary at this moment in time,” he stated.Midterm ElectionPoliticsSocial Justicebipartisanshipequal payJoe BidenJosh GottheimerNancy Pelosipolice reformProgressivesradical LGBT agendaSteny HoyerVeronica Escobar.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
269,"ORLANDO, Florida — Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Breitbart News exclusively that conservatives are looking for a fighter as their commander in chief.“I think that’s right,” Pompeo said when Breitbart News’s Matt Boyle asked if conservatives are looking for a fighter as president. “It’s what I saw when I ran for Congress for the first time in the big Tea Party class of 2010. They want someone who hasn’t fallen in love with the city of Washington and all that comes with it. They want someone who’s willing to break glass when that’s what’s required. They want someone who understands this is a righteous founding of our nation and that America is the greatest nation in the history of civilization and that we have a duty to continue to preserve that. And they’re looking for someone who’s willing to lay it all on the line to go do that, to take the brickbat, to take whatever may come and demonstrate leadership in spite of any resistance they may receive. I think the next set of leaders, not just whoever becomes the next president, but whether it’s members of Congress, city council members, school board members, all across America have a responsibility to do that right and if they do the American people will respect that and vote for them.”Pompeo sat with Breitbart News for an exclusive on-camera interview Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU). His interview came right after he walked off the stage from his speech, during which he blasted the swamp in Washington, D.C., and touted successes during his time working for now former President Donald Trump, first as CIA director, then as Secretary of State. Pompeo, widely considered a potential successor to Trump atop the “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) America First movement, finished fourth in CPAC’s straw poll of candidates in a GOP presidential primary, without Trump, at 7 percent. He came in just behind Donald Trump Jr., the third place vote-getter at 8 percent, and a few points behind South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, on whose home turf of central Florida this year’s CPAC occurred, came in a towering first place with 43 percent.Pompeo did not rule out a possible White House bid but said his focus for the next two years is on defeating the House Democrat majority and retiring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi once and for all.“Goodness knows,” Pompeo said of a potential presidential run. “I’m going to spend the next two years trying to make sure that the House of Representatives doesn’t remain in the thrall of Speaker Pelosi. I’m not leaving the fight. I care about these things. I’ve been so blessed. America has been so great to me that I’m not walking away from trying to make sure that America is just a little bit better and more secure every day.”This year’s CPAC came at a rough time for Trump supporters and the conservative movement. Democrats have complete control in Washington for the first time in over a decade. The last time they secured majorities in both chambers of Congress and the White House was 2008. But now, Democrat Joe Biden occupies the Oval Office and his vice president, Kamala Harris, is perhaps one of the most radical leftists to ever serve in the position. Meanwhile, Democrats retained their majority in the U.S. House — albeit a much slimmer one after GOP gains that defied expectations cutting into their control of the lower chamber — and took a slim majority that Harris’s tie-breaking vote gives them in the deadlocked 50-50 U.S. Senate.Pompeo said that the left wants conservatives to make a “mistake” by backtracking off the successes of the Trump years, but that Trump supporters need to “stay the course” on the America First agenda. Nonetheless, he admits he is “candid” that the next four years with Biden and Harris in the White House will “test’ conservatives and Republicans.“The mistake that the liberals want us to make is they want us to move away from our ideas and our principles, the things that generated so much good in the past four years,” Pompeo said. “We can’t do that. We’ve got to stay the course. We’ve got to continue to press. I’m mindful — I was a congressman — we won seats all across America. We have a bigger number in the House of Representatives. But I’m also candid. This four years is going to test us. We’ve got to be successful in 2022. We’ve got to win elections all across America and take away at least one job — from Nancy Pelosi — and then stay true to our principles, stay in the fight, continue to put America First at the forefront of everything we do. When we do that, we will prevail.”Pompeo’s interview came ahead of Trump’s speech on Sunday, where the former president would later lay out many of his policy successes and also expose early failures of the Biden administration. The former president’s first public address since leaving office also left open the question of whether he will run again, but made clear his intention to remain active in GOP politics across the country in a big way. Asked about what he was looking forward to hearing from Trump, Pompeo said he would be excited to hear Trump recite his administration’s policy wins — which Trump did.“I’ve spent a lot of time with President Trump these past four years, first as his CIA director and then as his Secretary of State,” Pompeo said. “I expect what you’ll hear tomorrow is a recitation of the good that our team did with his leadership. He’ll talk about why it worked. He’ll talk about the people in America that we care so deeply about. He’ll remind all of us that 70 plus million people continue to support the ideas that we put forward these past four years and so I think you will hear an awful lot about that. As for what he’ll say about his future, I’ll look forward to hearing that along with everybody else.”Pompeo also laid out the serious threats of the Chinese Communist Party to the United States of America. He said, too, that he does “worry” when he hears Biden dismiss concerns with Chinese human rights abuses as just cultural “norms.” Pompeo noted that the Trump team totally changed the way the world looked at China, and woke up the planet to the threat of a rising Beijing. He asserted the “single greatest threat” to America’s future is Chinese dictator Xi Jinping and his fellow Communists in Beijing.“We talked about it because it really mattered to America,” Pompeo said. “The single greatest threat to my kids and everyone’s children and grandchildren is the threat that Xi Jinping and his Communist fellow travelers will continue the way that they did for 40 years — this is not partisan — the way that they did for 40 years to run over the United States of America. It took our leadership, it took our team, to turn that tide and to recognize this threat and to confront it. When we did, we made real progress. To your point, I do worry. I worry when I hear President Biden say this is just differences in norms. Well, this is not just differences in norms. The Chinese Communist Party wants to undermine our democracy. They want to challenge the very way we exist today. They are intent on doing that and every leader has a responsibility to confront that every place we find it.”Pompeo added when pressed further on China that he believes the United States will eventually emerge successful from this strife with Beijing. He said that while the Chinese Communist Party has engaged in an impressive influence campaign that was able to “infiltrate” American universities and cultural institutions in a broad subversive push to alter American and western perceptions of China under its rule, Beijing’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic has opened eyes the world over to its dishonesty and malign intentions. He even went so far as to say the Chinese Communist Party “covered it up” regarding the virus’s origins in Wuhan, China, and how they knew it spread from person-to-person.“They got a good run at this thing, the Chinese Communist Party did,” Pompeo said. “They were able to infiltrate into our research institutions, our schools, in just exactly the way that you spoke about. But here’s the good news: that is that America has an infinite capacity to be able to push back against them. We’re not a nation in decline. I’ll give you a good example. They were out pitching propaganda on the Wuhan virus, saying that it began here in the United States. We sprung into action immediately and called them out and we presented the facts. We presented data. Everyone now understands that this virus came from China and that the Chinese leadership knew it would have human-to-human spread and it would have real risk to the world and they covered it up. This administration has a responsibility in the same way that we did to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the harm that they wrought to the United States of America.”Pompeo also highlighted the Trump administration’s push for peace in the Middle East, including most notably the Abraham Accords whereby the Trump administration facilitated peace deals between several Arab nations and Israel. Pompeo also had been leading efforts to negotiate peace in Afghanistan, and achieved a framework to end the war once and for all — Breitbart News had accompanied him to Doha, Qatar, while he was Secretary of State for negotiations with Afghan government officials and Taliban leaders last September — but it remains unclear if the Biden administration will keep that framework. Nonetheless, Pompeo said, the beginning of the path to true peace in the Middle East was paved in the Trump administration and, whether Biden follows it or it is picked up again by a future GOP president if Biden ditches it, the way forward is clear.“It was good work. It was important work. It was historic work,” Pompeo said. “I’m confident this will actually continue but it will take an American administration that is prepared to confront Iran. We talk about the Abraham Accords and then we talk about the enormous pressure we put on the Iranian regime. Those go hand in hand. They are connected. These Gulf states, these Arab states understood that the United States knew who the real bad guys were, the people who threatened America were largely coming from Iran. We recognized that. So, when we pushed back, these countries were able to say yup it’s fine we can now recognize Israel, we can do business with Israel, we can have diplomatic relationships with Israel, we can have Israel as a security partner, and so whether that’s the Bahrainis or the Emiratis or the Sudanese — whatever country — they came to understand that Israel could in fact be a good partner for them in the region. We changed the course of history. And I think this genie is now out of the bottle. I think that nations will continue to see that this is the right thing for their people and we will build on the Abraham Accords in important ways that will change the Middle East for an awfully long time.”The last topic Pompeo addressed in the interview was the deep state, and how the permanent political class in Washington aimed to undermine many of the Trump administration’s accomplishments. Pompeo said regarding the deep state that “it is real” and that the way conservatives can fight back against it is to go serve in government themselves and fill many of the positions necessary to implement policy domestically and overseas.“It is real,” Pompeo said. “The people who come to occupy many of the positions just below political positions in Washington, DC, harbor a worldview that is deeply different than the America First worldview that I spoke about in my speech here at CPAC today. Some of them will do the right thing and will respond to what the president and the Secretary of State wanted, but others worked to undermine it. That’s unacceptable. Second, I think that conservatives need to say ‘yes, I’m going to go serve. I’m going to go be a part of that. I’m going to go help an administration be successful at delivering on an America First policy whether that’s here at home or it’s abroad.’ If we allow the left to occupy these positions, and they continue to work inside of our government to undermine an administration like the one I was part of, we will always do and get less done and accomplish fewer things than we could have — and we’ll never ultimately get these policies to stick when it comes time when the next administration takes power.”Politics2022 midterm elections2024Abraham AccordsACUChinaChinese Communist PartyCPACDonald TrumpJoe BidenMiddle EastMike PompeoNancy PelosiOn the HillXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
270,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) leaves the U.S. Capitol after passage of the stimulus bill on March 27, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing. (PETER PARKS/AFP via Getty Images)Solidarity Is Not WokeWorking people are not woke. Yes, they want clean air and clean water, but the avant-garde preoccupations of Manhattan and Beverly Hills are not their preoccupations. Regular folks are focused on paying the rent or the mortgage, not on alleviating their guilt.  If Republicans want the votes of blue collars—including Hispanic blue collars—a decent respect should be paid to their opinions; yes, workers tend to be against abortion, against gun control, and against wokery, and yet they are in favor of things too, including higher wages, a dignified workplace in which they have an organized voice, and guaranteed health care.In other words, the working class is less libertarian and more communitarian—the Bible is a lot more popular than Atlas Shrugged. Moreover, if workers get their fair share, they will also be against The Communist Manifesto or whatever watered-down version of that sinister document AOC and the DSA might be trying to peddle. Why? Because if working people have a piece of the pie, they will want to protect it. And so they will be, yes, a bulwark against socialism.  For the non-rich, non-poor—the folks in the middle—a key ideal is solidarity: all for one and one for all.   It’s that spirit of solidarity that smart politicians have always been able to to tap into. For instance, here’s Franklin D. Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980.

Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
271,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) raged after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) rolled back coronavirus restrictions in the state, including the mask mandate, on Tuesday, warning that the move “endangers the entire country and beyond.”“93.2% of Texans aren’t fully vaccinated. The state just endured one disaster worsened by selfishness + denial of basic science, and now conditions are being set for another,” the far-left Democrat said, expressing outrage over the governor’s decision to roll back the statewide mask mandate, which had been in effect since July.“Repealing the mask mandate now endangers so many people, especially essential workers & the vulnerable,” she continued, warning that reopening the state “endangers the entire country and beyond.“We are in a pandemic. We know that COVID spread isn’t neatly contained by state borders, and explosions in COVID cases can increase the likelihood of new COVID variants to develop or spread to new places,” she added. “It’s dangerous”:This endangers the entire country and beyond.

Every business that wants to be open should be open,” the Republican governor said, noting that Texas now has sufficient tools to protect Texans from the Chinese coronavirus.“With the medical advancements of vaccines and antibody therapeutic drugs, Texas now has the tools to protect Texans from the virus,” he said.“We must now do more to restore livelihoods and normalcy for Texans by opening Texas 100 percent. Make no mistake, COVID-19 has not disappeared, but it is clear from the recoveries, vaccinations, reduced hospitalizations, and safe practices that Texans are using that state mandates are no longer needed,” Abbott added.Abbott said that over 7 million vaccines will have been given by next week, adding that the state administers “about 1 million” a week.“Hospitalizations & the positivity rate are lowest in 4 months.

272,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

274,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not respond to a question on Tuesday about whether President Joe Biden would force doctors to perform abortions and transgender surgeries against their faith beliefs.During a press briefing, a reporter from global Catholic network EWTN asked Psaki:Pro-life groups right now are very concerned about the phrase “pregnancy discrimination” in the Equality Act. You’re familiar with that, I’m sure, that it would force doctors to perform abortions even if it violates their conscience. There are also concerns the bill would force doctors to perform gender transition surgeries and sterilizations, again, even if it violates their conscience. What does the president, President Biden, say about those concerns?Psaki responded:The president’s been a long supporter of Roe v. Wade. It has been his consistent belief that should be law, and he will fight to continue to protect that as being law.“Conscience concerns, is that a concern of his?” the reporter asked again.“I think again I’m just going to state what the president’s policies are. Did you have another question?” Psaki asked.“Will President Biden keep the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division at HHS, the office that was put in place under President Trump, keep it in place to receive conscience complaints from those doctors?” the reporter asked.“You’ll have to talk to a future Secretary Becerra once he is confirmed,” Psaki replied.CatholicVote, a national faith-based advocacy organization, reacted to the exchange on Twitter that such a policy “would roll back entire First Amendment protections for doctors, health care providers and hospitals”:Policy would roll back entire First Amendment protections for doctors, health care providers and hospitals— CatholicVote.org (@CatholicVote) March 2, 2021In a recent interview with Breitbart News, Roger Severino, the Trump administration Office for Civil Rights (OCR) director at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), discussed his concern about the fate of the initiative referenced by the reporter in the exchange with Psaki.Under Severino’s direction, the HHS OCR Conscience and Religious Freedom Division was announced in January 2018 as a means to “restore federal enforcement of our nation’s laws that protect the fundamental rights of conscience and religious freedom”:OCR Announces New Conscience and Religious Freedom Division. It will restore federal enforcement of our nation’s laws that protect the fundamental rights of conscience and religious freedom. https://t.co/oqcS4y70SG— HHS OCR (@HHSOCR) January 18, 2018“They are doubling down on the cultural wars,” Severino said of the Biden administration. “There is a national consensus that whatever one thinks about the legality of abortion, you don’t force people to perform it against their will. You don’t force people to pay for it. Yet President Biden has said he’s going to repeal the Hyde Amendment and tear down conscience protections, including for the Little Sisters of the Poor. And that, that is disrespectful to life, conscience, and religious freedom.”During the press briefing, Psaki responded the matter of whether the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division of OCR would continue would need to be referred to Xavier Becerra, Biden’s nominee to lead HHS, should he be confirmed.“I can’t imagine a more divisive pick for such an important agency during a pandemic,” Severino said of Becerra. “His background is not health care, it’s not epidemiology. In fact, he is most famous, in terms of HHS, for being my antagonist.”Severino noted some of his confrontations with Becerra involved the California attorney general’s targeting of pro-life pregnancy centers and his alleged violation of the Weldon Amendment in requiring health insurance plans to cover elective abortions.The Equality Act, which has already passed the House, exempts itself from the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which means religious hospitals, schools, and other entities could face federal sanctions under the legislation, if enacted, for upholding their teachings and beliefs with regard to life, sexuality, and marriage.The legislation states:The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.The Equality Act’s text also states:Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.“Discrimination on the basis of pregnancy,” is a phrase that could be used to bring lawsuits against healthcare providers who refuse to perform an abortion or to outlaw policies that ban taxpayer funding for the procedure.Melanie Israel of the Heritage Foundation explained the legislation would force the term “sex” in the Civil Rights Act to mean pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and the last of these — “related medical conditions” — has already been interpreted to include abortion by both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.The Equality Act is legislative malpractice that turns equality on its head. It isn’t drafted as a shield to protect vulnerable minorities from unjust discrimination, but as a sword to persecute those who do not embrace new sexual and gender ideologies. https://t.co/YSWJpB6R7m— Ryan T. Anderson (@RyanTAnd) February 19, 2021Ryan Anderson, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, called the Equality Act “legislative malpractice that turns equality on its head.”“It isn’t drafted as a shield to protect vulnerable minorities from unjust discrimination, but as a sword to persecute those who do not embrace new sexual and gender ideologies,” he tweeted.FaithHealthPoliticsAbortionconscience protectionsEquality ActFirst AmendmentJen PsakiJoe BidenReligious freedomTransgender.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

281,"The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) heard arguments Tuesday on the legal challenge to two voting laws in Arizona that challengers claim discriminate against racial minorities. But Project 21, a black leadership network, issued remarks to the press warning that race is not the issue in the case.According to the SCOTUS website, the issues before the court are:(1) Whether Arizona’s out-of-precinct policy, which does not count provisional ballots cast in person on Election Day outside of the voter’s designated precinct, violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; and (2) whether Arizona’s ballot-collection law, which permits only certain persons (i.e., family and household members, caregivers, mail carriers and elections officials) to handle another person’s completed early ballot, violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or the 15th Amendment.“The challengers argue that both the policy and the law discriminate against racial minorities in Arizona, and the justices’ eventual ruling obviously could affect how the state carries out its elections going forward,” Amy Howe wrote on SCOTUSblog. “More broadly, though, the justices could also weigh in on the proper test for evaluating voting-rights claims like these, which could have a sweeping effect nationwide.”But leaders of Project 21 see other ramifications of the SCOTUS review and, along with the Center for Equal Opportunity, joined an amici curiae (“friends of the court”) brief written by the Pacific Legal Foundation.Project 21 is “asking the justices to remember that ‘[e]qual protection should ensure that government decision-making is free from the taint of racial considerations, but disparate impact liability does not allow racial impartiality.’”“Phony claims of voter suppression should never trump legitimate voter integrity measures,” Project 21 Co-Chairman Horace Cooper said in the press release announcing the group’s role in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee. “All Americans — black, white, or brown — benefit from ensuring that authentic, duly-registered voters cast the ballots that decide what policies and elected officials will govern their communities.”“While these laws have been challenged as a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 15th Amendment’s protections from racial discrimination infringing upon voting rights, they were upheld by the lower federal appeals court,” Project 21’s press release said.The brief argued that: Reasonable minds can and do differ as to whether these policies are advisable or necessary. But neither policy imposes a racially discriminatory burden on voting. And neither policy deprives any Arizona voter of the equal opportunity to cast a legal ballot.In response to claims that statistical disparities prove racial discrimination, the brief further explained:Equality of opportunity goes hand-in-hand with causation. If a statistical impact is observed, but a State’s election laws provide equal opportunity for everyone to participate in the process, it follows that the State’s election laws have not caused the disparate impact. The cause of the disparity in such a case is simply the “failure to take advantage of political opportunity.”“The Voting Rights Act was signed into law over 50 years ago to eliminate discrimination against blacks at the ballot box,” Project 21 member Christopher Arps, said. “This groundbreaking and historic law should not be manipulated into a vehicle to sow doubt, confusion, chaos, and racial animosity into the electoral process.”“Permitting so-called ‘ballot harvesting’ and the counting of votes cast at a wrong precinct do just that,” Arps said. “I hope the justices take this into consideration when they render their decision later this year.”The case is Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, No. 19-1257 in the Supreme Court of the United States. A decision is expected at the end of June.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.comPoliticsArizonaballot harvestingdiscriminationHorace CooperProject 21racismSupreme Court of the United StatesVoting Rights Act.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
282,"Democrats voted against his amendment to the proposed coronavirus relief package that would have stopped American taxpayers’ money from going to illegal aliens in $1,400 stimulus checks, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Saturday.Sen. Cruz announced the news in a Facebook post, referencing a tweet from the Senate Republican Cloakroom Staff:Democrats just voted against my amendment that would have prevented American taxpayer dollars from being handed out to illegal aliens in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks.Posted by Senator Ted Cruz on Saturday, March 6, 2021In an exclusive statement to Breitbart News on Friday, Cruz said, “Not only does this COVID bill fail to address the real needs of the American people who are suffering, but it hands out billions in taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants.”The senator’s office told the outlet blocking the checks would save citizens nearly $8 billion.“Congress should come together to pass my amendment to stop this,” he continued, adding, “We need to stand for the American people, get our kids back to school, and reopen our small businesses.”In its current form, the package could allow illegal aliens to secure subsidies for COBRA healthcare premiums.“Last month, Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Todd Young (R-IN) helped pass a budget amendment — with support from eight swing state Democrats — to make it more difficult for stimulus checks for illegal aliens to be included in the relief package,” the report said.Cruz’s social media followers expressed their disappointment at his announcement on Saturday.“All of our benefits should have the statement ‘for American citizens only’ included or added now!” one person said.“I am so sick of this Free-for-all WITH OUR MONEY since the new POTUS,” another commented.Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has reportedly signed off on a plan to tighten eligibility for stimulus payments, according to Breitbart News.“The direct payments would remain at the $1,400 level, the phase-outs thresholds would remain the same, but caps would fall. As a result, more Americans would be cut off from payments,” the article concluded.ImmigrationPoliticsPre-ViralcoronavirusIllegal Aliensstimulus checksTed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
283,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

I fully support a woman’s right to come forward, it should be encouraged in every way,” Cuomo said. “I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable.

Cuomo then apologized for making anyone feel uncomfortable, calling the allegations an “important lesson”“I also want you to know that I have learned from what has been an incredible, difficult situation for me as well as other people, and I’ve learned an important lesson. I’m sorry, I’m sorry for whatever pain I caused anyone, I never intended it, and I will be the better for this experience,” the governor said.Cuomo hadn’t spoken publicly since giving New York Attorney General Letitia James a referral to investigate claims that he sexually harassed at least two women in his administration.One former aide, Charlotte Bennett, 25, said Cuomo quizzed her about her sex life and asked whether she would be open to a relationship with an older man. Bennett rejected Cuomo’s attempted apology, in which he said he’d been trying to be “playful” and that his jokes had been misinterpreted as flirting.Another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, said Cuomo commented on her appearance inappropriately, kissed her without her consent at the end of a meeting, and once suggested they play strip poker while aboard his state-owned jet. Cuomo has denied Boylan’s allegations.And another woman, Anna Ruch, told The New York Times that Cuomo put his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her at a September 2019 wedding.The Associated Press contributed to this report. PoliticsAndrew CuomoNew York.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
285,"Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), who campaigned on “reforms to limit the role of money in politics,” failed to publicly disclose dozens of personal stock trades in possible violation of the federal STOCK Act, according to a report.Malinowski’s stock trades in 2020 included more than two dozen purchases and sales during the first several weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, cited in a five-page spreadsheet Malinowski’s office disclosed on Wednesday after a reporter asked about his stock activity.The spreadsheet contains stock trade information that does not appear publicly on the House’s website, as required by law.The spreadsheet notes that Malinowski made at least $671,000 and as much as $2.76 million worth of trades during 2020. Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately. The congressman did not make his own trades but instead “has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input.”Peter Schweizer, author of Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite, and whose first book was instrumental in the creation of the STOCK Act, said, “This is only further proof that we cannot trust members of the political class to police themselves on insider trading.”Reaction to the news was ablaze on Twitter, with calls for congressional members to be banned from trading stocks while in office.Ban members of Congress from trading stocks. https://t.co/CHaq5ppr8g— Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) March 5, 2021It’s time to ban all Members of Congress from trading stocks in individual companies affected by their official duties.https://t.co/W0wYKC9qe0— Richard W.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

The pipe now lays dormant on the ground “and [is] not being put into place.”Rutledge joined Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen (R) and 12 other attorneys general in signing a letter to Biden, which read in part:As the chief legal officers of our states, we write with alarm regarding your unilateral and rushed decision to revoke the 2019 Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. Your decision will result in devastating damage to many of our states and local communities. Even those states outside the path of the Keystone XL pipeline—indeed all Americans—will suffer serious, detrimental consequences. …We cannot “Build Back Better” by reflexively tearing down. America needs every tool in her possession to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger and more secure. You have expressed a commitment to unite the Nation. If that is to be more than empty rhetoric, you must fully consider and account for the alarming effects your actions have on states, local communities, families, and workers.Please be aware that the states are reviewing available legal options to protect our residents and sovereign interests.

287,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 Chinese coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.The New York Times details the coverup citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths.Cuomo (D) faced early criticism in his state for ordering nursing homes to take patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus, as the elderly are among those most vulnerable to the virus.After reports surfaced in February that Cuomo was intentionally hiding the numbers, the governor’s office explained he was withholding the truth to prevent then-President Donald Trump’s administration from using the data to launch a politically motivated attack.Cuomo blamed the “toxic political environment” and “disinformation” for the revised numbers.But the Times states Cuomo began hiding the truth about the numbers long before the Justice Department began their investigation in August.The June numbers showed the actual death toll in nursing homes was “roughly 50 percent higher” than the numbers ultimately cited by the Cuomo administration, according to the Times.The actual number of 9,250 nursing home deaths by June were much larger than the reported 6,432 nursing-home deaths — more than a 40 percent increase.According to the Wall Street Journal, the governor’s advisers stripped the number of nursing home residents who died after they were transferred to a hospital from the report, making the death toll look better for Cuomo.The doctored report, released in July, allowed Cuomo to continue trumpeting his success in fighting the virus in New York.“Whatever happens, this is going to be a period to learn from,” Cuomo said in a radio interview on July 10, just after the doctored information was released. “I am now thinking about writing a book about what we went through, lessons learned, the entire experience, because if we don’t learn from this, then it will really compound the whole crisis that we’ve gone through.”More than 15,000 New Yorkers in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have died from the Chinese coronavirus since March 2020.HealthPoliticsAndrew CuomocoronavirusNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
288,"GOP Senators will have to debate the Democrats’ pro-transgender Equality Act now that the far-reaching bill has passed in the House.Senate Democrats, however, are likely to repeat the tactics adopted by their House counterparts during the House’s 90-minute debate on February 25.Democrats fobbed off numerous and detailed Republican arguments against the transgender bill by repeating broad appeals, narrow insults, and sharp threats. The Democrats’ pressure was backed up by speeches from House Majority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).“We are winning. We will continuing winning. Our will is unbreakable. Our love is so much stronger than your sad, pathetic hate,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).The GOP members spotlighted the bill’s impact on women’s rights, womens’ sports, parental rights, free speech, and religious freedom. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) led the GOP side in the absence of the GOP’s leadership, Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) or Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).The many GOP advocates included Representatives Tom McClintock (R-CA), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), and Vicky Hartzler (R-MO).Democrats ignored the GOP’s points and denied all likely harms and risks. Two Democrats cited their personal connections to their adult children who want to live as members of the other sex.Several Democrats gave heartfelt speeches about gay rights — but Pelosi announced that she would never agree to pass a gay rights bill unless it also included the transgender ideology.No Democrats noted that the gay priorities are being made subordinate to transgender demands.No Democrats noted the danger to womens’ rights created by the transgender bill. The bill would redefine women as people with an unmeasurable female “gender identity” — such as transgender men — instead of people with female bodies, so denying women sexual privacy or the right to female-provided healthcare. Several Republicans emphasized this danger to rights for women.Editors in the establishment media largely distorted or ignored the GOP’s many arguments in favor of preserving government recognition of the two complementary sexes, even as they also posted many articles cheerleading for the transgender ideology.Still, the GOP members used the House debate to highlight the bill’s humiliating demand that American women subordinate their knowledge of biology and civics to the intimidating demands of men who insist on being described as members of the other sex.The House GOP members also did not emphasize the risk to childrens’ health created by the act’s endorsement of the transgender ideology. However, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) raised the health risks in a Senate hearing:Polls show the Democrats’ radical transgender ideology is unpopular among swing voters, especially because of the threat to female sports.Gay writer Andrew Sullivan says that the Transgender ideology undermines the idea of gay & lesbian rights.

289,"Border crossers released into the interior of the United States by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus just as President Joe Biden has denied that there is “a crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border.After taking office, Biden reinstated the Catch and Release program where border crossers are freed into the U.S. interior while they await asylum and immigration hearings that many do not ultimately attend, instead opting to live illegally in the country.Aside from about 25,600 migrants enrolled in the now-canceled Remain in Mexico program, border crossers released into the U.S. interior are not required to test negative for the coronavirus. Instead, communities along the border are being forced to test border crossers themselves.A report by NBC News on Tuesday confirmed that border crossers are testing positive for the coronavirus after being released by DHS officials into the U.S. interior:Miriam Izaguirre, a 35-year-old asylum-seeker from Honduras, crossed the Rio Grande at dawn Monday with her young son and turned herself in to the authorities. [Emphasis added]A few hours later she was released, and the first thing she did was take a rapid test for Covid-19 at the Brownsville bus station. They told her her test came out positive. [Emphasis added]…Several of the asylum-seekers who tested positive told Noticias Telemundo Investiga they were planning to leave Brownsville for their destinations; one of them bought a bus ticket for the journey. Eva Orellana, 29, who is from Honduras and who tested positive, said she was going to take the bus to North Carolina with her 3-year-old daughter. “On the way, we were wearing a mask all the time, gel, washing our hands,” she said. “Really, I don’t feel anything.” [Emphasis added]In Brownsville, Texas, where border crossers are being released, city officials are having to test for the coronavirus. Since city officials began testing on January 25, they told NBC News that that almost 110 border crossers have tested positive. This is a positivity rate of 6.3 percent.Even after border crossers test positive, at least in Brownsville, they are not required to quarantine. Border crossers interviewed by NBC News said they had tested positive but were planning to continue traveling throughout the U.S. interior to states like North Carolina, Maryland, and New Jersey.The report comes as Biden, just today, said there is no “crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border. On Monday, DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas also said there was no crisis at the border, claiming the administration is “managing” a massive influx of illegal immigration and releases of border crossers into the U.S. interior.Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), along with other Senate Republicans, demanded answers from the Biden administration last month on their release of border crossers without coronavirus testing requirements after Breitbart News pressed White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on the issue.Shoutout to @BreitbartNews' @charliespiering who pressed @PressSec about this very issue almost a month ago. Shockingly, Psaki dodged his question and it's now clear that the Biden Administration doesn't have a plan to deal with this. https://t.co/YZM6KXwdTq— Andrew Surabian (@Surabees) March 3, 2021Days later, DHS officials confirmed to Breitbart News that border crossers were, in fact, being released into the U.S. interior without being tested for the coronavirus.“President Biden’s border crisis is a superspreader event,” Cotton wrote on Tuesday.President Biden's border crisis is a superspreader event. https://t.co/IwphAnqrzn— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) March 3, 2021Elected Democrats last week urged the Biden administration to go further in releasing border crossers into the U.S. interior without being tested for the coronavirus.In a letter to Mayorkas, 61 House Democrats requested that DHS end the Center for Disease Control’s Title 42 order that has kept a rush at the border from occurring, according to House Republicans.The Democrats wrote that the Biden administration ought to be releasing all foreign nationals arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border into the U.S. interior, without testing requirements, so as not to spread the coronavirus in foreign countries.Thanks to Title 42, nearly 460,000 border crossers have been expelled and deported from the U.S. since March 2020. In the last four months, alone, between 62,000 to 65,000 border crossers have been expelled and deported monthly under Title 42.As Breitbart News exclusively reported, Biden’s DHS is considering ending Title 42.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

290,"ORLANDO, Florida — Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) denounced the partisan $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which the House passed last week and the Senate passed Saturday, as a Democrat “wish list” mostly containing items unrelated to immediate coronavirus relief, providing his remarks in an interview with Breitbart News during the Conservative Political Action Conference.Donalds said at the conference just after the House passed the bill last weekend that Democrats “wanted to get their wish list out of” the bill — which they were able to pack with non-coronavirus-related pursuits through a reconciliation process that allowed them to skirt the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster — because “they didn’t want to let a crisis go to waste.”“That’s why they tacked so much onto it, and in order to get some of the Democrat members to vote for this bill, they had to keep putting stuff into it. Let’s just be perfectly clear. That’s what happened,” Donalds explained. “There’s no reason why we couldn’t do the money to get shots in arms, the money to actually help people who have lost their job through COVID-19, not just sending checks out to everybody, because the truth of the matter is, not everybody who’s going to get a check is on unemployment. That is not true. A lot of people are going to get checks who are working right now today. This is the way they do things. There was no way to get support for that monstrosity unless you were buying off members of Congress, and that’s why the thing is almost two trillion dollars.”The House passed the massive spending bill last Saturday at around 2:00 a.m. almost entirely along party lines, 219–212, with zero Republicans and all but two Democrats voting in favor of it. The Senate, after a more than 24-hour long session debating various aspects of the package, passed the bill today, 50–49, again without a single Republican voting for it.Donalds said of House Republicans’ sweeping opposition to the bill, “Every time we see a piece of liberal policy, you oppose it, on grounds of principle and on grounds of fact. That’s just what you saw out of the Republican side of the House of Representatives when it came to the COVID-19 wasteful spending stimulus bill.”Later at the conference, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also ripped the bill as wasteful, telling Breitbart News, “I think we’re at the point where Americans are now like, ‘Look, it’s time to get back to normal, not spend another two trillion dollars on a bunch of ridiculous things that aren’t directly related to dealing with the virus itself.”Following its passage in the Senate, many Senate Republicans released scathing statements about the partisan package, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee put out a list of several of the irrelevant items included in the Democrats’ “spending spree,” including items related to “environmental justice,” “racial justice,” and taxpayer-funded abortion.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday praised “the American Rescue Plan” as “big, bold, urgent COVID relief for people across this country.”House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said in a statement the House will vote on the Senate-version of the bill on Tuesday.Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.HealthPoliticsByron Donaldscoronaviruscoronavirus reliefCPAC 2021On the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
291,"The Moderate Left vs. the Extreme Left“Big Labor May Save New York From AOC’s Socialism: Even public-sector unions favor old-style incumbent Democrats to radical insurgents like her.” That was the headline atop an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on February 19, referring, of course, to the extreme leftism of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In the piece, Steven Malanga argues that New York City’s labor unions are opposing AOC because she’s too left-wing for them.  And this issue matters most immediately because the nation’s largest and most influential city will elect a new mayor this year.  AOC herself is not a candidate, but she will seek to help elect a like-minded comrade.   In addition, New York state, dominated by the city, will hold gubernatorial and senatorial elections next year, and AOC is considered to be a potential primary challenger to Sen. Chuck Schumer.  According to Malanga, the unions know that AOC is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an outfit that routinely attacks unions for being insufficiently left-wing; Malanga quotes the DSA’s declared strategy for “militant . . . classwide struggles.”  However, most unionized workers are interested in bigger paychecks and greater benefits, not the revolutionary stuff of, say, Cuba or Venezuela.  Indeed, unions blame AOC for blocking Amazon’s expansion into New York City, which would have brought in 25,000 jobs, as well as billions in wages and revenues. As one construction union chief said of her influence, “Politics and pandering have won out over a once-in-a-generation investment in New York City’s economy.”We might note that when Malanga talks about unions as a bulwark against socialism, he’s not just talking about construction unions, which are traditionally somewhat conservative; he’s also talking public employee unions, including the teachers’ union.  Needless to say, nobody thinks of the teachers’ unions as conservative—unless, of course, one is comparing them to AOC and the DSA.  At the same time, nobody thinks of the Wall Street Journal as a pro-labor union publication. So when the Journal lauds unions as a bulwark against hard-leftism, the relationship is entirely tactical: If and when the threat from AOC goes away, the Journal’s affection for unions will also go away. Yet almost certainly, AOC is not going away. Indeed, at age 31, she rates now as one of the brightest stars in the Democratic Party, and she could continue to shine for decades to come.  So AOC’s likely long-term presence—and threat—might cause Republicans to think about their traditional, mostly hostile stance toward labor unions. The GOP might need the unions, just as Malanga says, as an additional bulwark against socialism.  Rep.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)So that raises a tantalizing possibility: Perhaps the Republican Party will wish to actively court the labor vote. The Democrats have a firm grip on the urban left, and they also have been doing well in affluent suburbs. Today, virtually all the suburban House seats around big cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia are represented by Democrats, and the Dems have even gained seats in suburban Atlanta, Houston, and Dallas. In fact, Democrats hold the seats representing the ten wealthiest Congressional districts in America, as well as 41 of the top 50. Yes, of course, Republicans should look to win back as many of those seats as possible, and yet at the same time, we should realize that the two parties are in the midst of an historic realignment—as Democrats become the party of the rich (and the poor), while Republicans become the party of the middle.   As it happens, just last year, this author wrote a piece for Breitbart News headlined, “‘Essential Workers’ Point the Way to a Republican Workers Party,” and then a few weeks later followed it up with a similarly themed piece, “The Republican Party of Cops, Nurses, and Other Workers—All Together.”Since then, leading Republican figures such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Sen. Josh Hawley, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Rick Scott have declared that the GOP is now the “workers party.” Moreover, a new NBC News poll bears McCarthy out: Support for Republicans is rising among the White working class, as well as among the Hispanic and Black working class.   To be sure, the Democrats won’t easily give up their claim to the working class. President Joe Biden has a decades-long connection to labor leadership, and just last week he brought labor chieftains to the White House, declaring, “I want to make it clear I’m a labor guy.”  Yet on the other hand, Biden supported the free-trade deals that are anathema to unions, including the North American Free Trade Agreement, Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People hold placards during a protest in support of Amazon workers in Union Square, New York, on February 20, 2021. (KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)More recently, the Biden administration had been curiously quiet about the attempt of Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, to unionize; that unionization vote, of course, pits workers against the mighty Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Finally, on February 28, just as the voting was starting, Biden released a video urging the workers to vote but conspicuously not telling them which way to vote, yea or nay on the union. So we can see: Biden seems to need the good will of Bezos and the Post just as much as he needs the workers.  In other words, “Middle Class Joe,” the fella born in blue-collar Scranton, PA, must contend with “Globalist Joe,” who takes his cues from Wall Street, Hollywood, and Big Tech. These neoliberal nodes support not only free trade, but also a slew of social and cultural issues that fall into the category of “woke.”  Yet perhaps the greatest flashpoint is another cause connected to wokeism, namely, environmentalism. The Greens Defeat the Blue CollarsFor a half-century or more, one piercing critique of the green movement is that it has pursued exotic environmental goals at the expense of jobs and economic growth.  That is, the mostly affluent greens have been besting the non-affluent blues (blue collars).Indeed, one can look at the brief track record of the new Biden administration and see already that the greens are winning—perhaps because the 46th president owes more to green donors than to ordinary voters. Thus Biden hired John Kerry, the ultimate environmental elitist, to be his “climate czar,” and on his first day in the Oval Office, he killed the Keystone Pipeline, taking away thousands of blue-collar jobs.  Yet of course, greens want still more, and they even want it to be Greta Thunberg-friendly. As the trendy-left New Republic magazine argued, “Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline was a solid start. But the Biden administration needs to do more than reward the youth climate movement with opening-month executive orders.” [emphasis added] Yes, that’s what avant-garde greens want now: a specific Biden pander to the “youth climate movement,” which consists, of course, mostly of the children of rich green liberals; the magazine suggested “establishing a youth council to advise the Biden administration on climate and other policy matters.” Ah yes, just what the nation needs: a White House office to host trust-fund kids.  In the meantime, the young adults of blue-collar Middle America are more likely to be looking for jobs or perhaps attending a state college.  Out of this obvious class cleavage, green vs. blue, we can see political peril for Democrats—and opportunity for Republicans.  A February 21 headline in Politico spelled it out: “Biden squeezed between promises to go green and bolster unions.”  As the article detailed, Biden will have to decide whether to import solar panels from China, so as to reach his carbon targets sooner and cheaper, or else to insist that the solar panels be made in the USA.  In the meantime, blue-collar labor chieftains are noticing that their people are getting the short end of the stick. As Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, told Politico:It’s pie-in-the-sky bull[bleep] about these green jobs being good middle-class jobs, because they’re not.  I’m concerned about union members and union families being left behind . . .  and I think they’ve already been left behind.So now we can see the Republican opportunity: to swoop in and come down, hard, on the side of the workers. That is, not just to champion the Keystone Pipeline, but also to demand that the Green New Deal, if there must be one, be Made in USA. (As this author has argued, and as Rep. Matt Gaetz has also argued, a carbon-reduction plan that included rural carbon capture could actually be a boon to the boonies.) In this photo from February 27, 2012, workers assemble solar panels by hand on the factory floor of the Chinese company Suntech in the eastern Chinese city of Wuxi. The success of Chinese companies like Suntech, the world’s biggest producer of solar panels, became a trade issue as American companies have accused them of dumping in the U.S. market and receiving unfair subsidies from Beijing.

Roosevelt, speaking to a blue-collar audience in Boston in 1944, when World War Two was summoning up the best in all Americans regardless of ethnicity or class: Today, in this war, our fine boys are fighting magnificently all over the world and among those boys are the Murphys and the Kellys, the Smiths and the Joneses, the Cohens, the Carusos, the Kowalskis, the Schultzes, the Olsens, the Swobodas, and—right in with all the rest of them—the Cabots and the Lowells.   All of these people, and others like them, are the life-blood of America.We can observe that this is the way the vast majority of Americans wish to think of themselves: as patriots in the melting pot of Team America, ready to do their fair share—perhaps even, if need be, making the ultimate sacrifice—as long as everyone is expected to be a part of the overall effort. It’s that non-shirking spirit that wins wars and makes a nation great. Today, moreover, we could update FDR’s speech and include in the melting pot “the Garcias,” “the Khans,” “the Patels,” and “the Yangs.” Applied to the homefront, this all-together spirit means solidarity in the workplace. As Breitbart News’ Rebecca Mansour observed, “There’s something universal about workers and power structures and the politics of left/right. The working class is not prone to socialism. They’re prone to unionism.” And so, she added, echoing the Journal’s Steven Malanga, “Unions have been—and should be—the bulwark against socialism and communism.”A Case Study in Winning Solidarity Dwight Eisenhower, West Point class of 1915, was a careerist in that most solidaristic of institutions: the U.S. military. Having led millions of men and women to victory in the European Theater of World War Two, he could easily see the value of solidarity on the homefront.  As Ike said in a presidential campaign speech to the American Federation of Labor in New York City on September 17, 1952:Today in America unions have a secure place in our industrial life. Only a handful of unreconstructed reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of breaking unions. Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of the right to join the union of their choice.That November, Ike was indeed well-liked: He won more than 55 percent of the national popular vote, carrying 39 of 48 states—including New York State.   And once in office, the 34th president, a Republican, was careful to balance capital and labor; he was pro-business, and yet he was also pro-labor. That was attested by a 1956 re-election campaign handbill, published by the Young Republican Labor Committee; the sheet features a cartoon of a happy worker-elephant carrying a proletarian lunchbox and touting such bullet points as, “INCREASED UNION MEMBERSHIP.” One hardly need mention that Eisenhower was victorious in that campaign as well, winning a second and even larger landslide. Okay, so now we can fast-forward to the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan—the only president ever to possess a working union card—declared, “One of the most elemental human rights [is] the right to belong to a free trade union.” At that time in 1982, Reagan was referring to the dissident shipyard workers of Gdansk, Poland, led by a fiercely anti-communist activist Lech Walesa, who started a wildcat union, Solidarnosc (Solidarity). And of course, within less than a decade, Walesa and his fellow workers, joined by other patriotic Poles, had overthrown the communist government in Warsaw. Now that’s the sort of union activism that the AOC types fear.  Friends and relatives of striking workers listen to the news given by Lech Walesa (C) outside the gates of the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, on August 25, 1980. The strike in the Gdansk shipyard lasted from August 13 to 31, along with other strikes which paralyzed the whole country. It finished by an agreement between the Polish government and the strikers’ joint committee, which sanctioned free and independent unions with the right to strike and greater freedom of religious and political expression. The newly-born trade union “Solidarnosc” (Solidarity) was an unprecedented working-class revolution directed against the communist government, and it quickly developed into a 10-million-strong independent organization. (JORMA PUUSA/AFP via Getty Images)Oh, and did we mention that Reagan won two monster presidential landslides in 1980 and 1984? And yes, both times, he carried New York state, unions and all.  For the most part, that was the way Republicans were back then; they saw themselves as governmental stewards, not ideological warriors. It was their job to steer the ship of state on a prudent course–including, as needed, sharp turns to the right–and the blue collars and Northerners in general were on board with that stewardship. Then, in the 1990s, the GOP began to change. The tilt in the party, toward the South, became unmistakable, and so Yankees no longer felt at home. Some in Dixie no doubt said, “Good riddance,” and yet if people leave a party, they take their votes with them. For proof, let’s look at the data: From 1952 to 1988, the GOP won seven of ten presidential elections, averaging 51.6 percent of the national vote. By contrast, in the last eight presidential elections, 1992 to 2020, the GOP has lost five, averaging a mere 45.3 percent of the vote.  So now that Republicans are out of power in the White House, as well as out of power in both chambers of Congress, maybe it’s time to start thinking about where the GOP might find more votes.Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan promised to rebuild America’s merchant marine fleet during a speech before the National Maritime Union in St. Louis, Missouri, on Oct. 9, 1980.

Harrity)The Future Victory CoalitionLast October, the data firm Echelon Insights studied the American electorate, dividing it into five broad blocs. One of these is the Trump MAGA/America First grouping, which accounts for just 16 percent of the electorate.So that’s a sobering realization right there: The overtly Trumpy vote is less a sixth of the total. That percentage might be enough to win Republican primaries, but it’s definitely not enough to win many statewide contests, to stay nothing of a national election.Thus we can see: The MAGA group needs allies.Poster created by the Young Republicans Labor Committee for Labor Day 1956. (Susan H. Douglas Political Americana Collection, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library)According to Echelon, the other blocs are as follows: Ronald Reagan-ish conservatives account for 25 percent; Mike Bloomberg-type urbanites and suburbanites total 11 percent; Joe Bidenite labor liberals amount to 26 percent; and AOC-type leftists are 11 percent.  We can quickly gather that the best fit for the MAGA 16 percent is the Reaganite 25 percent, although to make that a firm alliance, there will have to be some compromising and kumbaya-ing. Just like marriages, that’s the way coalitions have to work—or else they don’t work.  Yet still, that 16 and 25 adds up only to 41, and we need to get to 50+1. So where could the rest of the votes come from?  From what other bloc? Many analysts suggest that the new Republican votes will come from the ranks of Biden labor liberals and even, yes, from Bernie Sanders types further to the left—but that’s the union-minded populist left, not the woke-minded progressive left.   The populists, of course, are the folks who were solidly with the Democrats when they were the party of FDR, and yet not so much when they became the party of wokesters. Indeed, one suspects that Biden himself feels more comfortable with the Old Democrats, as opposed to the Woke Democrats. Yes, that might be the case for Ol’ Joe—but now, having made the bargain to be president, he’ll never tell. Unless, of course, he blurts it all out. And if he were to do so, wouldn’t that be something, as he exploded the Democratic coalition?Most likely, though, Republicans won’t get that lucky. Instead, we ourselves will have to do the hard work of coalition-building, assembling blocs of blue collars, thereby building a majority rainbow coalition of those willing to work, those reverent for tradition, and those respectful of law and order. As Eisenhower and Reagan proved, there’s a majority there.   Interestingly, just on March 2, the Republican-dominated Montana state legislature voted down right-to-work legislation, with nearly half the Republicans joining with the minority Democrats to support the continuation of Montana’s union-friendly environment. Right-to-work is an intensely controversial issue with plenty of Republicans on the anti-union side, and yet at a time when America’s biggest and richest companies have lined up with the Democrats–and anti-labor operatives are moving into the Biden administration–it only makes sense that Republicans will continue to move toward more pro-worker positions.  Once again, the two parties are realigning, or to put it more simply, they are switching places. Democrats are future party of business, and Republicans, if they can manage the transition, are the future party of labor.The Republicans as the worker-solder-first-responder party would not be well-funded, because the fat cats would be on the other side. However, it would have a natural political voting majority, which is more important. Why? Because there are a lot more working stiffs–of all colors–than there are plutocrats.  So for the GOP, it simply makes sense to go where the votes are.This is the real way to way get liberal tears: not by “owning the libs” through rhetorical shots, but by defeating the Democrats in elections. And that’s how we can save New York City as well as the country from socialism. Heck, if we build the right coalition, we might even save New York City from AOC herself.  EconomyPoliticsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezlabor unionssocialismSolidarnosc.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
292,"Officials with the United States Trade Representative Office (USTR) say they are considering a carbon border tax on foreign imports to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.In a detailed report, USTR officials noted that they may impose a carbon border tax — which would work similarly to a border adjustment tax — that would tax imported goods to the U.S. for every unit of carbon production used in producing those goods.The report states:The Biden Administration will work with allies and partners that are committed to fighting climate change. This will include exploring and developing market and regulatory approaches to address greenhouse gas emissions in the global trading system. As appropriate, and consistent with domestic approaches to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, this includes consideration of carbon border adjustments. Additionally, the Biden Administration will work with allies as they develop their own approaches and act against trading partners that fail to meet their environmental obligations under existing trade agreements. [Emphasis added]The plan, likely favored by USTR nominee Katherine Tai, is expected to be opposed by economic globalists in President Joe Biden’s administration who advocate for the elimination of tariffs and for global free trade.Michael Stumo, CEO of the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), told Breitbart News that any carbon border tax should apply equally to goods imported from high-carbon countries.“If a carbon border tax is considered, it should tax all goods and services from a high carbon country equally,” Stumo said. “Allowing heavy pollution is an economy wide subsidy in China and other poorly regulated countries, providing cheap, dirty energy to all their manufacturing and service businesses.”Tai touted the benefits of tariffs on imported goods in a confirmation hearing last week, saying, “tariffs are a legitimate tool in the trade toolbox.”John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

293,"Dr. Anthony Fauci cast doubts Tuesday on whether life would be back to normal by March 2022 as the coronavirus pandemic continues.“I don’t think we’re going to be completely normal a year from now,” Fauci said. “But I hope we’re well on the way to normality so that we can ultimately get the world protected at the same time as we get economic recovery so that all the unintended consequences of shutting down begin to normalize, including other health issues that have arisen because of the shutdown.”Fauci spoke about the fight against the coronavirus during an event organized by the University of Edinburgh.His comments clash with President Joe Biden’s prediction Tuesday life would be mostly back to normal in March 2022.“I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure,” Biden said to a reporter. “But my hope is by this time next year, we’re going to be back to normal and before that. I hope.”Fauci warned of new variants of the virus that would continue to spread, despite efforts to stop it.“Sooner or later, the variants, the new lineages the mutants will come back and rekindle the outbreak, even in countries that seem to have it under control,” he said.He warned against governments reopening their societies and economies too quickly.“What I often say is, if we jump the gun or do it too quickly, what happens is that you can get a resurgence of infection,” he said, adding that there was significant risk in doing so. “It’s very risky – if you go too fast, you’ll have a setback.” HealthPoliticsScienceAnthony FaucicoronavirusJoe Biden.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
294,"ORLANDO, Florida — The Republican Party should “absolutely” look to Florida as a model ahead of the 2022 elections, Rep. Greg Steube (R-FL) said during an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Friday.Appearing at CPAC, Steube pointed to the America First policies touted by former President Trump, which proved to be popular even among non-traditional Republican voters.“So I hope we’re going to focus on those America First policies and concentrate on that going into 2022. We only have to take five House seats back to take the majority in Congress. You don’t hear anybody in the mainstream media talking about that, because that doesn’t affect their purpose and their liberal ideology, but five seats is not a lot of seats,” he said, noting that redistricting will likely bode well for the GOP.“We’ve got redistricting here in Florida. With the census data, Florida is probably going to pick up one or two seats by population. Texas is going to pick up a seat. I think maps are going to be drawn in a way that could be helpful to us. So I’m focused on winning the House back in 2022,” Steube said, expressing confidence that the Republican caucus in the House also remains focused on that objective.“You obviously have people with different ideologies. You obviously have different people in the party with their opinions of the president, but I’ll tell you in Florida and in my district, the president is widely supported,” he said, citing a survey conducted in his district following the January 6 Capitol Riot. The survey, he said, showed 81 percent in his district expressing the belief that Trump should not be impeached. Trump also garnered a 71 percent approval rating, the Florida congressman added.Florida, which went red in the 2020 presidential election, “absolutely” serves as a model for Republicans,who hope to take the House in the 2022 midterm elections. Steube noted that he served in the statehouse for several years, where they cut taxes and regulations and enacted policies later embraced by Trump.All people have to do, he said, is look at the numbers in Florida with the policies they put in place in the last 8-10 years.“Look how beneficial and how prosperous Florida is right now – not just from an economic standpoint, but people are flooding here because of policies we have in place and coming from those blues states because they’re sick and tired of mask mandates. They’re sick and tired of their businesses being shut down, and they want to live their lives and the constitutional freedoms that we enjoy as Americans, and they can’t do that in Democratic states,” he said.Steube said it is crucial for Republicans to continue to embrace America First policies, such as bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and putting pressure on the Chinese Community Party.“And the Biden administration isn’t going to do that,” Steube said. “And so it’s going to be very easy to draw lines between what we would do and the policies that we support and the policies that the left supports.”PoliticsAmerica FirstChinese Community PartyCPACFloridaGreg SteubeOn the Hill.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
295,"The Supreme Court heard a pair of cases on Tuesday challenging Arizona’s election laws. Democrats claim that state laws on ballot harvesting and absentee ballots violate Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and the Constitution’s Fifteenth Amendment.“The Court has a stark choice between two systems here,” Supreme Court heavyweight Michael Carvin said in conclusion of the Arizona Republican Party’s argument. “Ours is clear, and we think derived directly from the text, and is easy to apply.”Chief Justice John Roberts kicked off the questioning of Carvin, with the chief questioning Carvin’s argument that VRA and the Constitution are violated when a legislature intends to disadvantage a racial group, rather than the Democrats’ argument that the law is violated whenever plaintiffs can show that a state law impacts one racial group more than others.  Carvin responded that such a rule would “eliminate all the valid anti-fraud concerns implicated” by these election integrity laws, adding that “the question is why a system that imposes no unfairness on the group should nonetheless be changed simply because they find a different method of voting more convenient.” When Justice Clarence Thomas asked about this principle of intending to treat all races neutrally rather than looking at socioeconomic and other differences between racial groups, Carvin responded that virtually every election regulatory would have become illegal as a result, and that “if Congress had intended that kind of sea change,” the federal law would have been explicit about it. “The question is not the outcome,” Carvin explained. “The question is the opportunity and if the state has provided everyone the same opportunity.” As Justice Samuel Alito asked Carvin to explain this rule in the context of the “usual burdens of voting,” Carvin responded that the ordinary effort required to cast a ballot in an election does impose a burden on voters, but that Congress and the Constitution do not makes such burdens illegal, even though some voters may find them more burdensome than others.“This is not some mystery,” Carvin later added. “We have a long history of how people go about voting. They show up at precincts and cast a vote.”Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused Republicans of rewriting the VRA, insisting that the VRA focuses on the effect of state government actions. Carvin disagreed, saying that the Constitution empowers state legislatures to pass laws on the time, place, and manner of elections, and that these laws do precisely that, while not denying the right of voters to cast ballots. Justice Brett Kavanaugh followed up with the question, “Can you tell us how courts are supposed to distinguish ordinary regulations from extraordinary ones?”Carvin responded that Democrats’ lawyers were casting countless voting laws in the latter category, that voters “can’t find precincts” or “get to mailboxes because of socioeconomic disparities, which means that the state needs to allow partisan operatives to go collect the ballots.”The justices also heard arguments on the Republican side from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who began, “Public servants have no more sacred duty than protecting the people’s right to vote while maintaining confidence in the integrity of election results,” insisting the law must have “a clear and constitutional test that allows states to meet these imperatives.”“Requiring in-person voters to cast their ballots at assigned precincts ensures that they can vote in local races and helps officials monitor for fraud,” Brnovich said, describing such measures as commonsense. “Restricting early ballot collections by third parties, including political operatives, protects against voter coercion and preserves ballot secrecy.”In response to a question from Alito regarding whether Democrats’ expressing alarm about how many voters would suffer burdens from the precinct requirement, Brnovich responded, “Mark Twain famously said there are three types of lies: Lies, damn lies, and statistics,” explaining that the Ninth Circuit appeals court in this case had “cherry-picked” statistics that seemed to support the Democrats’ argument, but that in reality less than 0.1 percent of votes are potentially not counted under that Arizona law. Brnovich added, “Arizona’s requirements that ballots be cast at assigned local precincts and its restrictions on ballot harvesting are appropriate election integrity measures that do not create any disparate impact on racial minorities but serve us all equally well.”“The desire to enhance the convenience of voting must never outweigh the imperative of securing the integrity of the result,” he concluded. Several of the justices – especially the chief justice – had probing questions for the Democrats’ lawyers, raising issues that have been in the news recently. “You’re aware of what the Carter-Baker Commission found about ballot harvesting,” Roberts said to one of the Democrats’ lawyers, Jessica Amunson. “They said absentee ballots are the largest source of potential voter fraud.”Citing different forms of voter intimidation, Roberts added that the 2005 bipartisan commission report “recommended that the practice of allowing candidates or party workers to pick up and deliver absentee ballots should be eliminated.”“All election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others,” Justice Amy Coney Barrett said to Amunson during her questioning, adding that “your approach risks ruling them all out.”During Carvin’s part of the hearing, he concluded that the argument pushed by the Democratic National Committee and Arizona’s Democrat Secretary of State:… is one that requires the courts to engage in a maximization policy, which anything that has a disproportionate result is somehow taken out of the hands of state legislatures. If you go down that path … that still gets the courts involved in an amorphous, manipulable situation where no one knows what the rules are going into the next election and they’ll all be decided on an ad hoc basis in a hyper-partisan environment. So, in addition to the fact that our test is the only one that comports with the text of Section 2 [of the VRA] and the Constitution, it’s also the only one that gives lower courts the clarity that is especially important in the voting context. A decision is expected by late June.The cases are Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee and Arizona Republican Party v. Democratic National Committee, Nos. 19-1257 and 19-1258 in the Supreme Court of the United States. Joel B.

296,"The Times Union is the second Editorial Board that has called on New York’s Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign after news broke of the nursing home deaths coverup, and multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.The newspaper’s editorial board wrote an op-ed titled, “Resign, Mr. Cuomo”:Enough. Mr. Cuomo has squandered the public’s trust at a time when it’s needed more than ever. Amid an enduring pandemic, it is vital that people can believe what their governor and their government are telling them, and that the rules they’re asked to follow and the sacrifices they’re asked to make are truly in the interest of public health. It is time for Mr. Cuomo to resign, and for those who helped him deceive the public to go, too.[…]We do not say this lightly. We endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor three times. He has brought to fruition a host of important progressive goals. But between his manipulation of state ethics bodies, multiple allegations of sexual harassment and these latest revelations on nursing home deaths, he has lost the credibility he needs to lead this state, especially in the midst of a public health crisis.The Board wrote, “New York still matters,” and “with its wealth, its legacy and its diversity come a special responsibility to stand as a moral voice in America.” The Board thinks “Mr. Cuomo can no longer be that voice.”On Thursday, the New York Times detailed the coverup, citing new documents and interviews with six people involved in the concealment of deaths. Cuomo’s aides rewrote a report from state health officials to hide 9,250 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.On Monday, Breitbart News reported a third woman came forward on Cuomo. Anna Ruch told the Times that, having never met Cuomo before, she removed Cuomo’s hand from her back at a wedding reception, and the governor then placed his hands on her face and asked if he could kiss her.“I was so confused and shocked and embarrassed,” Ruch said. “I turned my head away and didn’t have words in that moment.”The Democrat and Chronicle‘s Editorial Board was the first to call on Gov. Cuomo to resign after a trio of women accused him of sexual harassment.The editorial board wrote:We say this with no small amount of sadness. It is nothing less than tragic when public figures are felled by misbehavior that harms others and ultimately themselves. The governor faces no other choice. Three women say that he sexually harassed them, and one has a photo that helps verify her story. If he pursues a protracted battle to cling to his job — even as an investigation by state Attorney General Letitia James gets under way —  it won’t end well.[…]The power imbalance between the governor and, well, almost anybody is dramatic. This is why the leader of the Empire State must be held to the highest possible standard of behavior and decorum. New York governors are not above the rules, or above the law, or above the expectations of morality and basic decency. Our state needs a new leader who, undistracted by scandal, can protect New Yorkers’ lives during the pandemic, right the state’s economic ship and do much more to advance protections for women on the job and in society at large.As previously reported by Breitbart News, Cuomo said he would not resign from his post and asked New Yorkers to wait for the facts to be made public before judging the situation.HealthPoliticsAlbany Times UnionAndrew CuomocoronavirusNew YorkNew York TimesNursing Homes.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
297,"Future global coal projects must be immediately cancelled to end the “deadly addiction” to fossil fuels by the close of the decade, the U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said on Tuesday.Phasing out coal from the electricity sector is the single most important step to tackle the climate crisis, he said. Guterres’s call came at the opening of a virtual summit of the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA), a group of governments and businesses committed to ending coal burning for power. He said:Today, I am calling on all governments, private companies and local authorities to take three steps.First, cancel all global coal projects in the pipeline and end the deadly addiction to coal. Second, end the international financing of coal plants and … third, jump-start a global effort to finally organise a just transition [for coal industry workers], going plant by plant if necessary.”The veteran Portuguese Socialist called the world’s reliance on coal a “deadly addiction” and appealed for ending international financing for coal and providing greater support to developing countries transitioning to renewable energy.He spoke even as many countries struggle with the reality of using renewables to provide reliable baseload power to growing, thriving economies.China Joe is busy aiming his America Last wrecking ball at American energy.

298,"The Biden administration believes the American government alone can effectively vet U.S. visa applicants from terrorist-linked countries covered by former President Donald Trump’s travel ban, Breitbart News learned from the State Department Tuesday.That same day, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before a Senate panel that the U.S. relies heavily on information provided by the origin countries of individuals trying to enter America to vet them for criminal and terrorist ties effectively.Wray conceded that America could not count on most countries listed on Trump’s travel ban to provide accurate information, if any, on potential travelers.Hours after taking office on January 20, President Joe Biden repealed Trump’s travel ban on several nations, including seven predominantly Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa.To justify the bans, Trump cited concerns about foreign terrorist entry to the U.S. and American authorities’ ability to effectively screen visa applicants from terrorist exporting nations covered by the measure, such as Iran.When he addressed the annual conference hosted by the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) in Orlando this year, Trump criticized Biden for lifting his travel ban.Breitbart News asked the U.S. State Department to respond to that criticism and what the Biden administration plans to do to screen people seeking to enter the U.S. from the countries included in Trump’s travel measure.A spokesperson for State indicated that the U.S. vetting system is strong enough to compensate for the absence of verifiable background information from the banned countries referenced by the FBI director.“National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,” the State Department official responded on background.“Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes extensive security screening. Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat is key to protecting U.S. citizens here at home,” the official added.Without mentioning anything about cooperation from foreign countries, the spokesperson told Breitbart News the Biden administration would solely rely on U.S. government agencies to conduct the screenings. The official pointed out:Visa applicants are continuously screened, both at the time of their application and afterward, to ensure they remain eligible to travel to the United States. This screening draws on information from the full range of U.S. government agencies, including thorough biographic and biometric screening against U.S. law enforcement and counterterrorism databases.No visas are issued until all concerns raised through the screening process are fully resolved. Whenever we uncover information that might suggest an individual is a potential threat, the Department shares that information with all appropriate U.S. government agencies.The spokesperson acknowledged that the Biden administration might need to improve its vetting system to adapt to unforeseen threats. The official noted:Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats. We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes and to support legitimate travel and immigration to the United States while protecting U.S. citizens.In June 2018, the Supreme Court upheld an updated version of Trump’s travel ban that restricted U.S. entry to many citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela, and North Korea.Trump expanded the travel ban in early 2020 to restrict entry to some citizens of six additional countries— Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Sudan for having “subpar passport technology” and a “failure to sufficiently exchange information on ‘terrorism suspects and criminals,” Al Jazeera reported.During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, the FBI director agreed that the vetting of potential foreign terrorists seeking to enter the U.S. depends not only on America’s criminal and terrorism databases.It relies “heavily” on foreign governments providing background information on the travelers’ identity, and criminal or terrorist ties.Wray’s comments came in response to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), who also asked:[W]ithout cooperation from those governments, if a terrorist is not already in our own databases, we could “query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing to show up,” unless foreign governments work with us. Is that still the case?“Certainly,” the FBI director responded. “We depend heavily on cooperation from foreign governments to make that kind of defense effective.”Wray also agreed with Cotton that there is a lack of cooperation on potential migrants trying to enter the U.S. from some countries on Trump’s travel ban, namely Syria, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Burma, North Korea.Sen. Cotton proclaimed:I just want to note before we close on this topic that all of those nations–Syria, Iran, Libya, Burma, North Korea–were among the nations from which President Biden lifted travel restrictions by executive order on his very first day in office without any plan in place to improve security for those travel situations.Each of them represents a real threat to the United States.Citing State figures, the Associated Press (AP) reported in January that more than 40,000 people were refused visas because of the ban.Israel / Middle EastNational SecurityPoliticsChristopher WrayDonald TrumpJoe BidenTom Cottontravel banU.S. State Department.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

304,"House Whip James Clyburn (D-SC) introduced gun control legislation this week and made clear that the current push is just the “first step.”On March 1, 2021, Breitbart News noted National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) warnings that Clyburn was going to put forward gun control to extend the period of time it takes to undergo an instant background check for a gun purchase. Current law allows such checks to be extended up to three business days to allow FBI reviewers to sift through pertinent criminal records. Clyburn’s bill would expand the extended review to at least 10 days.NPR spoke with Clyburn about his gun control proposal, and he made clear it is only the beginning. He opined that the legislation expanding the time frame for background checks to be conducted “is a good first step,” then quickly moved on to talk about the need for universal background checks.Clyburn said, “A large majority of Americans, including gun owners, support universal background checks. This legislation is needed to keep weapons out of the hands of those who should not have them and save lives.”Ironically, Democrats often point to the Parkland, Sandy Hook, and Las Vegas mass shootings when promoting universal background checks. Some will also point to the January 8, 2011, Tucson, Arizona, attack in which Gabby Giffords was injured. But they never explain that universal background checks would not have hindered, much less stopped, any of these attacks. That is because those who attacked Parkland, Las Vegas, and Giffords all acquired their guns via background checks.The Sandy Hook attacker stole his guns, so no amount of background checks would have stopped him.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

305,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform.

306,"February 2021 was the 14th consecutive month of record National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) checks.FBI figures show that 3,442,777 such checks were performed in February, breaking the February record set in 2020 by over 600,000 checks.February 2021 saw more NICS checks than any February in history, even after 13 consecutive months setting new records for this application process.In other words, January 2020 saw more checks than any January in history, up to that time, and February 2020 saw more checks than any February in history, up to that time. March 2020 saw more checks than any March in history, and April 2020 saw more than any other April. This pattern continued all the way through February 2021.Background checks do not provide a precise indicator of the number of guns sold, as the checks are run on the buyer rather than the gun. Moreover, a buyer can purchase multiple guns once he or she passes the NICS check.Some states also run the checks on concealed carry permit holders and, in those instances, the checks clearly do not signal the transfer of a firearm.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

307,"Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL) suggests a Republican-led amnesty plan for millions of illegal aliens living in the United States could be unveiled “probably next week.”In an interview with Fox Business Network’s Larry Kudlow, Salazar said she is working on her own piece of legislation that would give “legality” to millions of illegal aliens.“What would the GOP do? That’s exactly what we’re trying to put together and we’re going to have something for you and for the viewers probably next week,” Salazar said.Salazar said providing an amnesty to illegal aliens who have been in the U.S. for at least five years is necessary to “send a message to the Latinos or the browns in this country that we in the Republican Party, we have the same values entrenched in our party that are in their hearts.”“Don’t you think that the Republican Party should be talking to people like me? Well, we have not,” Salazar claimed. “We have not done it. Why? For whatever reason.”Despite Salazar’s claims, former President Donald Trump had increased his support among Hispanic Americans between 2016 to 2020 from 28 percent to 32 percent after surging interior immigration enforcement and reducing overall legal immigration levels to boost U.S. wages and job opportunities for the lowest of wage-earners.In fact, Trump won over more Hispanic Americans in the 2020 election than pro-amnesty Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) did in the 2008 presidential election. McCain, one of the co-sponsors of the “Gang of Eight” amnesty in 2013, won 31 percent against former President Obama’s 67 percent.Trump, running on the most pro-enforcement GOP platform in decades, last year boosted his support in deep blue majority-Hispanic communities that sit along the U.S.-Mexico border. In 20 Texas counties that are on or near the border, Trump won eight compared to winning just three in 2016. Even more, support for Trump increased in all but one of the 20 counties.Kudlow agreed with Salazar that the GOP should back amnesty, saying most illegal aliens have “been good citizens for a long time” and deserve “legality or citizenship or some combination of green cards.”Salazar, who said illegal immigration has been good for big business, said illegal aliens are “doing jobs that other Americans don’t want to do.” The latest unemployment predictions suggest that working-class jobs — those in the food services and hotel industry — may never return as automation cuts into the labor market.Today, while President Joe Biden proposes an amnesty, more than 17 million Americans are jobless and those in the lowest-paying jobs have been hit the hardest as a result of economic lockdowns spurred by the Chinese coronavirus crisis.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Members of Congress must report the value of their stock assets only in broad ranges, which makes a precise total elusive.“Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,” Colston Reid, Malinowski’s chief of staff, said.“This was not an effort on the part of the congressman to conceal any trade activities,” Malinowski’s spokesperson, Amanda Osbourne, added, separately.

The bills include Scam PACs, shareholder authorization before making certain political expenditures, and the creation of a public database to make transportation funding more transparent.Malinowski isn’t the only Democrat caught in a stock trade snafu: Several members of Congress or their immediate family members have in recent years made personal investments that range from curious to scandalous.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, the businessman Paul Pelosi, in December poured up to $1 million into call options for stock of the electric vehicle company Tesla.

309,"Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Chuck Grassley (R-IA) on Tuesday during a Senate hearing called out left-wing domestic violence over the summer amid an apparent attempt by Chairman Dick Durbin (D-IL) to use the January 6th Capitol breach to tie the political right to domestic extremism.Grassley said he agreed that the violence at the Capitol on January 6th was a “desecration” that “disgraced our country,” and he called for those who broke the law that day to be prosecuted.However, he said, to fully address domestic extremism, threats must be looked at across the political spectrum. “A narrow view of these matters would be intellectually dishonest,” he said in response to Durbin’s opening remarks at the hearing, which was on oversight of the FBI.Grassley then called out violence coming from the left, the media not covering it, and its encouragement by then-senator and now-Vice President Kamala Harris.We must call extremism wherever it happens, across the board, left or right, every time. We must focus our resources to try to see as much of it coming as we possibly can, wherever it comes from.It hardly registered in the media when Marshals and Secret Service officers defended courthouses and the White House. That’s not Senator Durbin’s fault. That’s the media’s fault. They were called storm troopers by the speaker of the House, like they aren’t even human beings.Vice President Harris, when she was a senator, supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund, an organization that helped bail out violent rioters in Minnesota. Thirteen staffers of a candidate for president at that time boasted on Twitter that they donated to the group. According to one news report, the group paid $75,000 to get one man out of jail when he was charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting at a police officer during the May protests.He noted that innocent law enforcement officers were targeted over the summer, with more than 700 officers injured between May 27, 2020, and June 8, 2020.“Officers have been assaulted, slashed, struck with hammers, baseball bats. and blinded by lasers. Sixty-seven Secret Service officers were injured during a 3-day siege on the White House, which caused then President Trump to be brought into a secure bunker,” he said.He also recalled when Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and his wife were surrounded and harassed as they were leaving the White House last summer:We also remember on television seeing our colleague from Kentucky having a hard time getting to the White House when he wanted to go there sometime last summer. We also had the church across the street was lit on fire, across the street from the White House, as part of that continued left-wing assault. More than 300 people were charged federally for their roles in those months of violence.Eighty of those charged related to the use of arson and explosives. At least 14,000 people were arrested in 49 cities. At least 25 people died in violence related to the riots. There has been 280 arrests as a result of the January 6th attack compared to more than 1,000 arrests as a result of riots just in Portland last year. It’s been estimated that insurance losses of the summer’s civil unrest possibly exceeded $2 billion.Grassley also called out Antifa:It’s been a relatively frequent sight at summer’s violence events to see individuals acting in coordination, holding the ‘A’ symbol for Antifa. And as I said before, I don’t disagree with anything I heard Senator Durbin say this morning, but we did have an admitted Antifa adherent in Portland murder a conservative protester.He noted that Antifa rioters attacked the Oregon Democratic Party headquarters, even after Inauguration Day.He also raised the left-wing shooting targeting 24 Republicans on a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, that left Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) with a life-threatening injury at the time.“In light of these ever present left-wing threats, I’m concerned about resource shifting talk among our colleagues across the aisle. Let me say this clearly, we aren’t going to defund the Anarchist Extremism Program or any other domestic terrorism program,” Grassley said.“No serious oversight activity and no other policy decisions can be made without doing both as we move forward. I encourage both houses of Congress to re–review not just the events of January 6th, but also domestic violent extremism across the board and the threat it brings to our families and communities,” he said. Follow Breitbart News’s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook. Law and OrderPoliticsAntifaCapitol riotsChuck GrassleyDick Durbindomestic extremismKamala Harris.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

311,"Democrats have agreed to extend enhanced unemployment insurance through September with a smaller boost to benefits, according to multiple media reports.The legislation would put the enhancement at $300 per week, down from $400 in the version passed by the House, but would extend the enhancement through September from the earlier draft’s August end date.The deal also makes $10,200 of unemployment benefits exempt from taxes, providing relief to families who might have faced an unexpected tax bill.This compromise is a great result. https://t.co/jMdKYJyDUG— Ronald Klain (@WHCOS) March 5, 2021White House chief of staff Ronald Klain applauded the changes on Friday.Some Democratic Senators have worried that providing too much enhancement could prompt out-of-work Americans to avoid returning to work because they receive more from unemployment insurance than they would in wages.There is still some chance that this deal will not hold. Republicans have proposed an amendment that would reduce the enhancement to $300 without extending it into September. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) is reportedly undecided about which version of the reduction to support. So, here's the vote-a-drama that's holding up the vote-a-rama– Carper amendment would cut UI benefit to $300, extend it thru Sept, and make first $10.2K non-taxable– Portman amendment would cut to $300, but cut it off earlierManchin might vote for Portman's amendment.— Grace Segers (@Grace_Segers) March 5, 2021EconomyPoliticsCOVID reliefunemployment.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
312,"The U.S. economy is out-performing expectations on almost every front.Friday’s release of the employment situation in the U.S. is just the latest data point showing that the U.S. economy is growing at a much faster pace than anticipated. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, the Department of Labor said. January’s figure, which was initially reported as a very weak 49,000, was revised up to 166,000. Combined with smaller job losses in December, it’s clear the labor market is in far better shape than forecast.It’s not just jobs. Factory orders rose by 2.6 percent in January, topping the estimate for a 2 percent rise. December was revised up from 1.1 percent to 1.6 percent. Construction spending grew by 1.7 percent in January and an upwardly revised 1.1 percent in December. It’s up 5.8 percent for the year.The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index points to better growth than expected. Retail sales are rising.In short, the economic picture has failed to live up to the “dark winter” that President Joe Biden said America was facing.

313,"It’s a pandemic conundrum.Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs and are collecting unemployment. Fed officials say the real unemployment rate, after taking account of people working reduced hours and people miscounted as working, is close to 10 percent.Yet businesses across the U.S. tell Fed officials they cannot find enough workers.In the Fed’s Beige Book, a collection of anecdotes from business leaders compiled by each of the Fed’s twelve regional banks, reports of labor shortages arise over and over again.“Employment was flat, with rising labor demand offset by labor supply constraints,” the Minneapolis Fed reported.“A contact in St. Louis reported residential construction projects are severely backlogged due to labor and material shortages,” the St. Louis Fed wrote.The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said that labor demand in the freight sector is especially strong and many firms say they would like to hire more drivers but are prevented by a shortage. Several firms in Cleveland said deliveries to customers were delayed.Driver shortages were also reported by the Richmond Fed, the Atlanta Fed, and the Kansas City Fed.The Kansas City Feds says the majority of contacts reported labor shortages.“Employers in the construction, manufacturing, auto mechanics, and healthcare sectors continued to be constrained by shortages in qualified labor,” the San Francisco Fed notes.“Labor supply shortages were noted by contacts as most acute among low-skill occupations and skilled trade positions,” the Atlanta Fed’s summary covering all 12 districts says.So what’s going on?Part of the problem is that employers are competing with enhanced unemployment benefits. Ordinarily, state-run unemployment insurance pays around half of what a worker got in wages and the exact amount paid is linked to what the workers wages were. But at the start of the pandemic, the federal government started chipping in hundreds of extra-dollars without regard to pre-layoff wage levels. This started out as $600 but was cut in half over the summer. But even at the lower level, a significant number of workers are getting more from benefits than they did while they working.Another issue is the skills mismatch caused by the way the pandemic roiled the economy. The leisure and hospitality sector has been devastated. At last count, the sector employed nearly 3.9 million fewer workers than it did prepandemic. Hotel managers, bartenders, and actors who paid the rent by waiting tables cannot instantly convert into healthcare workers, home builders, or truck drivers.In a typical downturn, people in declining industries shedding workers eventually do retrain and move into growing occupations. But the pandemic has shut down businesses that were not in decline and many workers are likely waiting to go back to the kind of jobs they had before. After all, many of the workers wanted to be in those occupations, not the ones that are trying to hire now.Then there’s the fact that at least some of the increased demand seen in some sectors is likely temporary and may reverse as the economy reopens. In Wednesday’s Beige Book, for example, the Boston Fed says it was told by a supplier of goods to veterinary services that business has boomed because people have been adopting more pets in the pandemic. But they are worried that the heightened demand will go away when the economy reopens. In that case, it wouldn’t make sense for a hotel manager to get trained as a vet when the future demand is going to be for hotel managers.A third factor is childcare. Many schools remain closed or partially closed. Someone has to stay home to watch the kids. That makes them unavailable for employment.Finally, some of this is probably a bit of businesses blowing hot air. Claims of labor shortages have persisted in good times and bad for at least the last 15 years—and for much of that time wages were not rising by much. Some employers appear to experience the need to pay higher wages to attract workers as evidence of a labor shortage. Having to compete for workers with other businesses strikes some owners as unfair.So we find ourselves like the Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s parched ancient mariner, surrounded by undrinkable sea water.

314," U.S. factory orders rose by a sizzling 2.6 percent in January to $509.4 billion, data released by the Commerce Department Thursday showed.December’s strong gain was revised up to 1.6 percent, representing $496.3 billion.The release beat expectations. Economists polled by Econoday had forecast a 2 percent gain.Orders for durable goods, stuff built to made to last at least three years, jumped 3.4 percent to $256.7 billion. This was led by transportation equipment, which rose 7.7 percent to $85.1 billion.Orders for nondurable goods rose a slower 1.9 percent.Orders for construction machinery were up 6.2 percent, reflecting the surge in homebuilding.Orders for nondefense, non-aircraft capital goods—a proxy for business investment—rose 0.4 percent to $252.7 billion. Nondefense aircraft orders, a volatile category, were up  389.9 percent to over $5 billion.This is the latest evidence that the U.S. economy is growing much faster than expected. President Biden had warned Americans that they faced a “dark winter’ ahead and has proposed a $1.9 trillion spending program to stimulate the economy. The outperformance of the economy on many metrics has led to questions about whether the economy needs that much stimulus and raised the risk that the economy could overheat.Economydurable goodsfactoriesmanufacturing.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
315,"The federal government’s debt will rise to twice the size of the economy by 2051, the Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday.The CBO said that by the end of 2021, federal debt held by the public is projected to equal 102 percent of GDP. That is before taking into account the $1.9 trillion covid spending bill currently being considered by the Senate.“Debt would reach 107 percent of GDP (surpassing its historical high) in 2031 and would almost double to 202 percent of GDP by 2051,” the CBO said.From the CBO’s report:Debt that is high and rising as a percentage of GDP boosts federal and private borrowing costs, slows the growth of economic output, and increases interest payments abroad. A growing debt burden could increase the risk of a fiscal crisis and higher inflation as well as undermine confidence in the U.S. dollar, making it more costly to finance public and private activity in international markets.In the CBO’s estimate, budget deficits will fall as the pandemic’s effects wane but will remain high. They will then begin to rise again in the second half of the decade.Federal Debt“Deficits increase further in subsequent decades, from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2031 to 13.3 percent by 2051—exceeding their 50-year average of 3.3 percent of GDP in each year during that period,” the CBO said. EconomyPoliticsBudget Deficitdebt.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
316,"The Democrats’ $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill would recreate the 1970s-era welfare system by offering $120 billion in cash payments to parents who do not even try to work, say senators and critics.Versions of the welfare-for-every-parent plan are being pushed by nearly all Democrats and by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), prompting Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) to object:Sending $250/$350 per month/per child to everyone, with no work requirement, is welfare Being pro-family means being pro-workOur expanded Child Tax Credit idea is a far better approach— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 23, 2021The “Democrats plan is just repackaged welfare,” Rubio tweeted on February 26. “What I have been proposing for years (and partially achieved in 2017) actually allows low income parents to receive even more money than the Biden plan by keeping more of the money they earn from work.”The bill is being debated this week in the Senate, and Democrats hope to pass it for a presidential signature by March 14.The bill is being pushed via the “reconciliation” procedure, so it can pass the Senate with just 50 votes. But two parties each have 50 votes, so individual senators may have the power in the tied Senate to remove or reform unwanted parts of the massive spending package.The $120 billion plan is funded for just one year — but few observers believe Congress will cut off the checks in the midterm election year of 2022.“President Biden’s welfare plan would greatly increase cash grants while eliminating all existing work obligations in the current child credit program,” says Robert Rector, the poverty expert at the D.C.-based Heritage Foundation. “It abandons the link between work and welfare established by welfare reform in the 1990s and re-establishes the principle of unconditional entitlement to taxpayer-funded benefits,” he added.Poor Americans need aid, but the no-strings award promise of cash to non-working parents “goes too far,” says Oren Cass, founder of the pro-family American Compass think tank. In a March 2 op-ed for the New York Times, he wrote:a [anti-poverty] program should ask recipients to do their part in supporting themselves….[Our alternative] plan mirrors Mr. Romney’s, but caps a family’s annual benefit at their earnings from the prior year. In the example above, the family would need to have earned at least $7,200 in 2020 to receive the benefit’s full value in 2021. One part-time job at the current minimum wage would be more than sufficient. The test is, essentially, “Did someone in your household work last year?” If so, you are “paid in” to receive the supplement.The 1970s welfare-for-nothing program encouraged millions of poor parents to avoid work, says author Mickey Kaus in a February 26 article for Newsweek.The resulting public opposition to the program, dubbed “Aid to Families with Dependent Children” (AFDC), was recognized by Democrat presidential candidate Bill Clinton, who won his 1992 election with a promise to “end welfare as we know it.”Kaus continued:In 1996, a combined [House Speaker Newt] Gingrich/Clinton effort killed off AFDC, replacing it with a new program run by the states, with federal rules requiring work and a porous 5-year limit on aid. [Democrat] Senator Patrick Moynihan of New York anticipated “children, sleeping on grates, picked up in the morning frozen.” That’s not what happened. Helped by the strong pre-2000 Clinton economy, single moms went to work in unprecedented numbers. The welfare caseload fell by half. The poverty rate kept dropping, including for children. Not everything worked: the effect on out-of-wedlock births seemed to fade quickly. States, the alleged “laboratories of democracy,” didn’t do much creative experimentation at all.

We now plan to create a more flexible, interconnected ecommerce experience that gives consumers easy access to unique, high-quality products across all our franchises.People will still be able to access the more than 600 Disney Parks stores, shop-in-shops, lifestyle and outlet locations, and third party retailers around the globe, the company said.The decision comes as online retailers such as Amazon experienced a surge in profits during the coronavirus pandemic due to lockdown orders limiting in-person shopping.In August, Amazon was reportedly talking with the largest mall owners in the United States in hopes of turning retail spaces into fulfillment centers.“Many of the department stores previously occupied by Sears and JCPenney, both of which have filed for bankruptcy and closed dozens of stores, have left retail spaces across the country empty,” according to Breitbart News.However, Amazon has already set up fulfillment centers in strip malls that went out of business.In February, the Job Creators Network Foundation (JCN) announced it was launching a campaign to reveal Amazon’s plan to kill small businesses, Breitbart News reported.“Amazon has been running op-eds and advertisements urging lawmakers to more than double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour,” JCN said in a press release.“After nearly a year of pandemic-related shutdowns, a $15 minimum wage could be a deathblow to the thousands of small businesses already hanging on by a thread,” the foundation stated.Disney has been under fire recently for firing conservative actress Gina Carano and being silent about Chinese concentration camps.EconomyPre-ViralTechAmazonDisneyE-Commerce.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

323,"President Joe Biden’s deputies are quietly helping a large group of recent foreign graduates get U.S. white-collar jobs needed by American graduates.The news was announced on February 26 via a statement largely incomprehensible to American graduates: “USCIS today announced flexibilities for certain foreign students affected by delayed receipt notices for Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization,” said the announcement from the United State Citizenship and Immigration Service Agency.The changes were applauded by the foreign “students” who are eager for Americans’ jobs: “This is a welcome relief,” said a tweet from “Arjun K.”And the foreign graduates are demanding more benefits, even though most are less skilled than American graduates. “We do appreciate the progress we made together last week,” tweeted Jade Wang. “But it hasn’t solved all problems, and there is a long way to go. Please take some measurements to speed up the approval or release the work permission temporarily.”The processing delays under President Donald Trump helped protect Americans’ right to their own national labor market. MinnPost.com reported in July 2019:“We’ve had students have job offers rescinded once the employer has waited as long as they could. It’s devastating to the student,” said Jacy Fry, director of the Kearney Center for International Student Services at Mankato State.The job-giveaway is made via the little-known Optional Practical Training (OPT) program and matching Curricular Practical Training (CPT) program. In 2019, the two fraud-ridden programs provided work permits to roughly 400,000 mid-skilled and inexperienced foreign graduates for a wide variety of white-collar starter jobs — so helping to push 100,000s of American graduates out of technology, science, health care, and business jobs that could help them launch careers and earn a good living. Foreigners get the OPT work permits and the jobs by first enrolling in American universities — regardless of how many Americans send taxes or tuition to the same universities to earn the degrees they need for careers.Biden's deputies cancel DHS office for seeing signs of anti-American discrimination by CEOs who hire 350K+ imported 'OPT' contract workers.The main victims are US graduates, incl. Biden voters.BTW, estb. media rushed to protect OPT cheats in 2019. #H1bhttps://t.co/6O4BKaPkM1— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 27, 2021Media interviews spotlight the foreign graduates’ sense of entitlement to Americans’ jobs and the labor market. CNBC reported February 19:Shantanu, 33, received his Ph.D. in structural biology from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in December. His OPT application arrived on Nov. 17 and he didn’t receive a filing receipt until Feb. 11. He’s still waiting for work authorization and is unable to start his postdoctoral fellowship at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine.“We invest a lot of time coming to the U.S., working in the U.S. and contributing to the U.S.,” said Shantanu, who asked to be identified only by his first name. “And after a while, when we are treated like this, it makes us wonder why we chose the U.S. in the first place.”The programs deliver many nurses, therapists, doctors, and other healthcare workers into Americans’ jobs. CNBC reported: “Ji Hyun came to the United States from South Korea to pursue her dream of becoming an intensive care unit nurse … ‘We’re not here to steal jobs. We are here to help the economy and find our dream. It’s not to harm you or anything,’ she said. ‘We’re just trying to be here and live with everybody and have a normal life like everybody else.'”Many American science grads do not get their desired careers after paying U.S. universities for tuition and degrees. But Taiwanese worker Wei Chen complained to CNBC: “My other peers are already doing research, experiments, publishing their results. During this time, the only thing I can do is wait.” Chen has been in the United States for five years.The comments show that the foreigners are using their student visas to smuggle themselves into U.S. careers, said Kevin Lynn, the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. “They didn’t choose the U.S. to come to study and return home — they chose the U.S. to live and work,” he said.The OPT and CPT programs get little publicity. Many immigration reporters do not have the editorial approval to show immigration’s impact on Americans — even on the reporters’ college-graduate friends, families, and peers.The OPT program is strongly supported by business groups, but also by the universities, in part, because the universities get roughly $40 billion a year in tuition fees from foreign graduates who want to work in American careers.Some OPT workers are hired from college into good jobs at elite firms, such as Amazon, Facebook, or Microsoft, often via ethnic hiring networks. Once hired at elite firms, the selected graduates are typically nominated for a place in the H-1B visa program, allowing them to eventually get the huge prize of green cards.For example, Intel has hired 6,591 foreign graduates since 2003, and Amazon has hired 12,173 foreign graduates with OPT work permits since 2003. Since 2003, Amazon has also hired 9,302 pre-graduate CPT workers, while Intel has hired 6,453 CPT workers, so helping to completely change the demographics of the company’s workforce.Amazon is owned by Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post. The newspaper provides very little coverage of the Bezos work permit programs.The inflow of India's visa-workers creates a huge 'bonded labor' workforce that empowers Fortune 500 CEOs & shrivels professionalism, say US/India tech-professionals. ""We’ve lost our competitive, innovative advantage because of it,"" says US manager. #H1Bhttps://t.co/EgkcLsf4Xm— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) May 21, 2020But most OPTs get low-profile, mid-skill, low-wage gig worker jobs at the many low-status outsourcing subcontractors that were created to help the Fortune 500 companies hire foreign graduates in place of Americans.Few of the OPT and CPT gig workers complain about their lower-wage jobs because CEOs can fire them at will — or instead nominate them for the H-1B program and sponsor them for the prize of green cards.Jay Palmer closely monitors this layered hiring system in his role as a human rights advocate for migrants, visa workers, and trafficked workers.U.S. college graduates owe so much in student loans that have to work for at least $45,000 or $50,000, but the OPT worker “will come out and work for $30,000 because of the poverty levels back in their home country,” he told Breitbart News, adding:They’ll work for 30 percent to 40 percent less than Americans can work and drive American salaries down and drive the [U.S.] college students out of work.The [OPTs] will live very cheaply, sometimes five and seven and eight to a house. They will send their money back to their country, for example, India, Slovenia, Croatia, or China or Vietnam, Venezuela, or other countries. So it is not helping the economy because they’re not spending money here .. tax receipts decline, municipalities lose out.And the [employers] are paying them on 1099s. The majority of them on 1099s never file their taxes. This is a huge scheme that I know that the State Department and Department of Labor is looking at. The Fortune 500 companies have their master services agreements with third-party contractors and are saying that they’re not liable for this.If a company hires an American college graduate, the company has to pay employment tax, unemployment tax, Social Security taxes, pay their health care, all of the normal benefits. But if they hire an OPT worker, they’re hiring them through a third-party contractor, paying them on 1099s, without benefits or taxes. So their rate of return [per employee] is about 80 percent higher. They save up to 28 percent just by not paying benefits.And the [subcontractor hourly] rates are lower. If the rate [paid by the Fortune 500 company to the subcontractor] is $50 an hour [per graduate], the workers probably end up maybe getting $20 an hour, and the subcontractors pocket the difference. That scheme is known as the layer system.The layer system is also used to hide the Fortune 500’s hiring of white-collar illegal aliens, such as former OPT workers who overstayed their visas, he added.Many of the OPT workers are so exploited that they can sue for unpaid pay and for green cards, said Palmer. “This falls under the [2008] Trafficking Victims Protection Act, the forced labor section. It is a very short section, about a half a page … so under the law it’s human trafficking.”Palmer works with the Weiser Law Firm in Pennsylvania.Overall, the layer system of U.S. companies and contractors employs roughly one million foreign graduates in a wide variety of career-starting jobs needed by Americans. This huge “Green Card Workforce” helps push Americans aside, reduces average salaries, suppresses the workplace clout of American professionals, and prevents the emergence of American-run companies that could threaten elite control over the tech sector.It also prevents American graduates from getting starter jobs in the careers they trained for at American universities. A 2014 study by the Center for Immigration Studies reported:Only one-third of native-born Americans with an undergraduate STEM degree holding a job actually work in a STEM occupation.There are more than five million native-born Americans with STEM undergraduate degrees working in non-STEM occupations: 1.5 million with engineering degrees, half a million with technology degrees, 400,000 with math degrees, and 2.6 million with science degrees.“The nation graduates more than two times as many STEM students each year as find jobs in STEM fields,” Hal Salzman, a public policy professor at Rutgers University, wrote in 2013.President Joe Biden’s pending amnesty would dramatically expand the inflow of foreign graduates into American jobs. The bill would allow Fortune 500 companies to offer green cards to an unlimited number of foreign recruits in exchange for just ten years of indentured work in lower-wage jobs. The bill is also backed by university groups, including the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.56% of male Democratic partisans favor corporate importation of skilled foreign workers — but only 35% of Democratic women are OK with the organized replacement of US graduates.

324,"We had expected Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak to deliver the Magic Money Tree but what he has actually delivered is a Cloud Cuckoo Land budget. Really, you don’t need to be a Goldman-Sachs-trained economist to realise that the numbers just don’t add up and that this is a stop-gap, smoke-and-mirrors exercise to fool us into imagining that the UK economy is not on the brink of total disaster.Sure, during his lonely speech, delivered to an almost empty chamber, Sunak dropped some heavy hints that all was not well.Sunak said: “It is going to be the work of many governments over many decades to [pay the money borrowed] back”, and just a one per cent increase in interest rates and inflation now would increase the cost of the government’s debts by £25 billion at a stroke.But the impression given was that with a bit of tinkering here and there – ‘special economic zones’, ‘bounce back loans’, ‘restart grant’ etc – we will all somehow muddle through.We won’t.The elephants in the room are, of course, the SAGE and NERVTAG (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) committees, which have assumed the role of Britain’s unelected government.As Chancellor, Sunak ought by rights to have a much bigger say in the direction of Britain’s economy than, say, Neil Ferguson (aka Professor Pantsdown) whose heroically pessimistic and discredited Imperial College coronavirus pandemic computer model first got us into this mess; or than, say, Susan Michie, the behavioural expert and Communist mostly cushioned from the effects of her own proposed policies thanks to the £50 million she shared with her siblings in 2019 when they sold a Picasso inherited from their mother.But in fact, as we’ve seen in the last twelve months, it’s these unaccountable scientific advisory groups that have made all the running in dictating Britain’s seemingly endless series of lockdowns.In the early days of the pandemic last year, Sunak was known to be the senior minister most opposed to lockdown and the keenest to get the economy up and running again. Back then, he was overruled by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove and Health Secretary Michael Gove. Now it looks like he has pretty much resigned himself to the inevitable. His announcement that the Furlough payments — i.e. the methadone drip which keeps all the people made unemployed by the lockdown vaguely appeased and semi-content — will be extended into September looks less like the light at the end of the tunnel and more like an oncoming train.More and more states in the U.S. are abandoning mask mandates and opening up for business. Sunak, who was a Fulbright scholar at Stanford, must be looking across the pond with envy. But as just about the only voice of resistance at senior level in the Boris Johnson administration, there’s precious little he can do to avert the inevitable disaster.And it is inevitable.Britain has suffered its biggest economic collapse in over three hundred years — since the Great Frost of 1709 when the Thames froze over. Sure, its economy might have bounced back under a government with any appetite to put people and business and jobs and freedom and education and cultural survival and decency and common sense before the draconian ordinances of an unelected body of activist scientists. Unfortunately, with the hopeless Boris Johnson at the helm, it simply hasn’t got one of those governments.So Sunak had to make the best with the very feeble material he has been given. It helps that he has a tame Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), predicting that the economy will grow this year by 4 per cent, by 7.3 per cent [yeah right] in 2022, then 1.7 per cent, 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in the last three years of the forecast. It also helps that he has a vivid imagination, which allows him to pretend that ‘more than 700,000 people have lost their jobs since last March’ – when he must surely know that the real unemployment figures (which the furlough is concealing) already run into the millions.As for the budget itself — well it’s clear that Sunak has learned a lesson from his most Machiavellian predecessor, the dark lord ‘George’ Gideon Osborne, that if you keep moving those cups round fast enough when you play the shell game no one will be able to spot where you’ve hidden the pea — or indeed have lost the pea altogether because you are totally broke and your creditors took it as collateral.So, for the moment, he hasn’t actually — as was feared — raised income tax directly. He’s just done it indirectly by freezing personal allowances, thus bringing more people into the higher tax brackets within the next few years, especially as Britain heads towards the racing certainty of galloping inflation.As a bread and circuses sop to us proles, he has abandoned a mooted hike in duty on booze, and on fuel too. (Let’s see how long that lasts: Boris’s green government LOATHES car drivers, for a start).And though he has increased Corporation Tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, he has attempted to maintain the illusion that his government is pro-business with another fancy-pants wheeze called a ‘super deduction’ incentive for businesses to invest.The new rule would allow companies to reduce their tax bill by 130 per cent when making capital purchases — as Sunak said, a construction firm buying £100 million of new equipment could reduce its tax liability by £130 million.Maybe this will work. Maybe it won’t. But it certainly won’t impress those of us who believe government’s job is to get out of the way of business rather than try to micromanage it with endless taxes and subsidies, as though the state knows better than entrepreneurs how to do their job.The other major disappointment is that this budget extends the Conservatives’ track record of raising the national tax burden to ever greater heights. Even before the Chinese Coronavirus pandemic, taxes were at their highest levels since the 1960s. This latest budget — according to Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies — takes taxes to ‘their highest sustained level in history.’We might have expected this under the leadership of a neo-Marxist such as former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. I don’t think many of us realised that it would happen under a Prime Minister who once wrote in a column that ‘voting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts and increase your chances of owning a BMW’.

327,"Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) overruled calls from progressive democrats on Monday to override the Senate’s parliamentarian and include a minimum wage hike in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill.Durbin said Democrats should instead look for another piece of legislation to use as a vehicle for trying to increase the minimum wage. “I don’t think that’s going to work. I hope that we think very seriously about dealing with the minimum wage in a different venue,” he said.Durbin’s decision to support the parliamentarian over the loudest part of the Democrat Party is the lastest sign $15 minimum wage hike will not be included in President Joe Biden’s Coronavirus package, which only allocates nine percent of the bill’s expenditure towards Coronavirus vaccinations.House progressives and outside groups have urged Democrats to put Harris in the chair presiding over the Senate and ignore advice from the parliamentarian.“Eighty-one million people cast their ballots to elect you on a platform that called for a $15 minimum wage,” the progressives wrote in a letter to Biden and Harris that was spearheaded by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.“We urge you to keep that promise and call on the Presiding Officer of the Senate to refute the Senate Parliamentarian’s advice … and maintain the $15 minimum wage provision in the American Rescue Plan.”White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki answered the progressives’ demand, “The decision for the vice president to vote to overrule or to take a step to overrule is not a simple decision.

328,"President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated Tuesday that he would likely support new rules to force corporations to disclose their political spending activities and workforce diversity, and tighten disclosures around climate change, policies that critics fear would make businesses more susceptible to political pressure from the left.At his Senate confirmation hearing, Gary Gensler signaled support for these new disclosure rules long sought by Democrats and activists. For years, the S.E.C. has resisted instituing such requirements on the grounds that they go beyond protecting shareholder interests. Critics say they merely serve to pressure companies to adopt the left’s orthodoxy on climate, diversity, and political spending. More recently, however, some of the biggest investors, such as the $8.7 trillion BlackRock, have also been pushing for these disclosures.Companies already have to disclose climate change risks to their businesses but some progressives want more detailed disclosures, including reporting on how much energy a company uses from fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, asked Gensler if he believed the SEC could require a company whose energy bills are low-enough that they are not financially significant to report how much of their energy use comes from renewables.Gensler did not answer directly and said that disclosure requirements will be based on the concept of materiality. But in the exchange that followed, he seemed to lean toward the idea that further and more detailed disclosures were likely appropriate.This was followed by  Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Ma.) asking whether there is any reason why companies should be able to hide their climate risks from investors.“No, they should not,” Gensler said.Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) asked Gensler about whether political contributions represented “material” information that should be disclosed.  Gensler said there was rising demand from investors for the information.Conservative critics warn that such disclosures are not intended to inform investors about actual risks to the business but to allow pressure groups to target companies for using fossil fuels, to reduce donations to conservative think tanks and politicians, and to empower trial lawyers to sue companies for inadequate disclosure.Asked about whether the SEC should require companies to disclose information on workforce diversity, Gensler did not answer directly but hinted at support for more detailed disclosures by adopting the framework that broader human capital matters are material to investors.“I think human capital is a very important part of the value proposition in so many companies,” Gensler said.EconomyPoliticsBiden Administrationconfirmation hearingSECSecurities and Exchange Commission.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

330,"Americans, by three to one, strongly favor the preservation and use of President Donald Trump’s border wall, according to a poll by Harvard-Harris.The panel of 1,778 adults was asked: “Do you think that any holes in the border wall with Mexico should be patched or should be left open?”Seventy-three percent of the respondents wanted the government to patch gaps in the wall, while 27 percent opposed such action.Retaining the existing wall received 79 percent support when respondents were asked: “Should the hundreds of miles of the border wall that have been constructed over the last few years be left in place or dismantled?”Only 21 percent — or one in five — said the government should come down.The border wall is a barrier to illegal migration and to the transport of drugs into Americans’ communities.The survey was conducted February 23 to 25, as border-agency officials struggled to minimize media coverage of the growing number of economic migrants they have invited to the U.S. border.President Joe Biden stopped the additional construction of the border wall as soon as he got into office. However, a lawsuit may force Biden to restart construction because his agencies have not completed work that Congress directed and funded in 2019 and 2020.The Harvard-Harris poll also showed the public ambivalence toward the wall. For example, 53 percent of respondents in the poll said they supported Biden’s decision to halt the construction.Forty-seven percent of the public disagreed with Biden’s decision.

331,"The fossil fuel-dominated energy sector and the banking sector have the best one-month performance, indicating a rotation of leading stocks as the Biden administration took hold of the White House and Democrats took control of the Senate.One of the maxims of investing is: don’t mix politics with investing.That may be borne out by the performance of stocks in the early weeks of the Biden administration and Democrat control of both House and Senate. The Democrats are not typically thought of as especially friendly to big banks, consumer finance companies, financial firms, and fossil fuel energy companies. Yet those are the ones whose stock has done the best over the past month.The energy sector is up 24.6 percent, making it the best performing.The banking sector is up 19.4 percent over the past month. Consumer finance is up 18.81 percent. Financials overall are up 14.84 percent.As Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg news explained Tuesday, some of this may be due to the fact that energy companies and financial firms benefit from income redistribution.In general, there’s been a big change of stock market leadership since the election. Banks and energy companies have surged with the prospects of more stimulus. Growth companies have flagged. Interest rates have gathered upside steam, especially since the Georgia runoff cleared the way for more spending and faster growth. In a note, Goldman’s top commodity strategist Jeff Currie maintained his bullish call on the asset class, citing environmental policies and increased demand through income redistribution. (Households with lower incomes tend to spend more, therefore income redistribution is growth positive.)In short, wealthy people can only buy so much gasoline and open so many bank accounts. Redistributing wealth away from high income Americans toward lower income Americans benefits energy and banks.It’s also possible that investors do not see the Biden administration’s green energy plans and banking regulations as bad for the bottom lines of the biggest companies in these sectors. Regulations create barriers to entry, reducing competition and typically rewarding the biggest players in a sector.

332,"The White House has dramatically raised the number of migrant youths and children it expects to welcome into the United States’ economy this year.The new goal is 117,000 youths and children, up from the 30,000 “Unaccompanied Alien Children” (UAC) migrants who were brought to the border by coyotes during 2020, and well above the record inflow of 76,000 delivered in 2019.The goal of 117,000 was leaked to Axios as part of a media campaign in which administration officials argue they have no moral choice but to let the migrants into the United States. The campaign is also intended to fend off theatrical criticism from the left, whereby progressives say the youth and children do not need to be kept in the shelters where they are provided with health screens and the legal paperwork needed to get jobs and residency.Axios reported March 2:DHS currently projects there will be 117,000 unaccompanied child migrants crossing the border this year, according to information on the slides.What to watch: The administration is looking at ways to reduce the shelter populations by accelerating the release of children to sponsors already in the U.S., the sources said.The report said officials want to have shelters for 20,000 migrants at a time.“This is exactly their intention — getting alien minors into the country,” said Rob Law, the director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies. “They’re encouraging the trafficking of these children … and have no respect or compassion for Americans who lose economic opportunities because of their policies on legal and illegal immigration,” said Law, who worked as policy director in former President Donald Trump’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency.The Axios leak also shows the federal government’s growing cooperation with the coyotes and cartels who deliver the youths and children to the U.S. border, under contracts from the illegal-migrant parents in the United States, said Law:With the level of coordination that seems to be going on right now, it’s hard to know where we’re one end stops and the other one begins, The language coming out of the Biden administration is no different than the seductive terminology that the cartels and the coyotes use to get people to fork over money they don’t have to take the dangerous journey north to a place that they have no lawful basis to be.In 2013, a federal judge noted that border agencies helped to smuggle a child from El Salvador to her parent in Virginia under an $8,500 contract: “Instead of arresting Salmeron Santos for instigating the conspiracy to violate our border security laws, the DHS delivered the child to her — thus successfully completing the mission of the criminal conspiracy. It did not arrest her. It did not prosecute her. It did not even initiate deportation proceedings for her. The DHS policy is a dangerous course of action,” the judge wrote.Since 2010, more than 300,000 youth and children have been escorted by coyotes through the cartels’ roadblocks and then passed to federal agencies. The relay process was created by the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act that says federal agencies should relay the underage migrant to sponsors, the vast majority of whom are parents or in-laws of the migrants.In 2020, Trump used federal law to break the coyotes’ conveyor belt by sending thousands of young migrants back to their extended families in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The Associated Press reported January 29, 2021:The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit’s stay of a lower court ruling allows President Joe Biden’s administration to resume expulsions begun by former President Donald Trump under a public health policy citing the COVID-19 pandemic. The appeals court issued a stay that had been requested by the Trump administration shortly after a federal judge in November barred the practice.…At least 8,800 children were known to have been expelled prior to the federal court order. They included children as young as 9 who were denied the chance to request asylum or other protections under U.S. law.Most of the migrants expelled by Trump were teenagers seeking low-wage work in the nation’s growing child-labor workforce. Others were young children seeking to join their parents who had earlier trekked across the border seeking to get jobs in American cities.But Biden’s deputies are determined to restart the policy of extracting migrants from Central American for use in the U.S. economy as low-wage workers, taxpayer-aided consumers, and high-occupancy renters.The young migrants are coming to escape crime and poverty, say Biden’s progressives. “We are not apprehending a 9-year-old child, who has come alone, who has traversed Mexico … whose loving parents sent that child alone,” insisted Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We’re not expelling that 9-year-old child to Mexico when that child’s country of origin was Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador,” Mayorkas said March 1.“Honestly, I think almost everyone in the system knows that most of the [migrant] teens are coming to work and send money back home,” Maria Woltjen, executive director and founder of the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, told a reporter for ProPublica. “They want to help their parents,” she told ProPublica for a November 2020 article that reported:Around Urbana-Champaign, the home of the University of Illinois, school district officials say children and adolescents lay shingles, wash dishes and paint off-campus university apartments. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, an indigenous Guatemalan labor leader has heard complaints from adult workers in the fish-packing industry who say they’re losing their jobs to 14-year-olds. In Ohio, teenagers work in dangerous chicken plants.…Though most of the teens interviewed for this story are now 18, they agreed to speak on the condition that they not be fully identified and that their employers not be named because they feared losing their jobs, harming their immigration cases or facing criminal penalties.Some began to work when they were just 13 or 14, packing the candy you find by the supermarket register, cutting the slabs of raw meat that end up in your freezer and baking, in industrial ovens, the pastries you eat with your coffee. Garcia, who is 18 now, was 15 when he got his first job at an automotive parts factory.The youths’ journey can be very dangerous. On January 30, the Los Angeles Times reported the death of roughly 13 teenagers who entered the progressives’ Hunger Games obstacle course, including 15-year-old Robelson Isidro. Gunmen reportedly killed the victims and left their bodies in burned-out pickup trucks:The [Guatemalan] community has a long history of sending migrants to the United States, and [Isidro] had uncles who lived there. They had indoor kitchens. They didn’t have to cook outside under a tarp.“He was ashamed,” his mother said in a phone interview. She said he told her: “I’m going to fight to make my dreams come true. I have to get my siblings ahead in life. I’m going to get them out of poverty.”His uncles [in the United States had] wired him money to make the journey north.Biden and his deputies want to create a large illegal population for a future amnesty, said Law. He continued:The goal is to get them here because once they’re here then they’re never going to leave. And the results will be substantial taxpayer resources that are drained, and schools overwhelmed by children who don’t speak the language. and aren’t at the appropriate educational level.An appendix to the January DHS report shows that 315,000 UACs were accompanied from Central America to the border by coyotes from 2013 to 2020.The vast majority of UACs were the children of illegal migrants who had earned enough money in U.S. jobs to hire coyotes to escort their children to U.S. border officers, who then deliver the young migrants to their parents. Only about 15,000 of these younger migrants have been sent home by early 2020, while roughly 90,000 were allowed to stay — even though many were coming to work as child laborers in jobs that would have been held by Americans.Mayorkas’ claim that children travel alone to the border “is absolutely appalling,” Law said, adding:The deception that this administration uses with language is to obscure the heinous nature of what these parents are doing. They know what’s going to happen on the journey. The kids have no say in the matter, and they will be harmed, some far worse than others. [Illegal migrant] parents want their families to live with them illegally in the United States instead of the parents going back to the home country where they actually should be.The Biden administration has the legal authority to repatriate the migrant youth and children when they are delivered to the border, Law noted:There is no obligation to accept the kids. It is a policy choice by this administration to disregard the enforcement tools that are available to control the borders and to end future flows of child trafficking. They’re choosing to make business great for the coyotes, to increase the likelihood of trauma and harm to an entire generation of Central American minors who would not otherwise be subjected to this …. There’s absolutely nothing compassionate about being engaged willingly and intentionally in the trafficking of children.The establishment media is allowing itself to be used, he said. “The media has been complicit … They were willing to buy any narrative that came out of the Obama and Bush administrations. They bought it hook, line and sinker, and they still don’t press the question, they refuse to connect the dots,” he said.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.Trump reclaims the moral high ground by spotlighting the huge cost to migrants (& Central America) of the progressives' extraction-migration policy.

333,"President Joe Biden’s deputies are welcoming illegal migrants who are injured while trying to evade border barriers.The Los Angeles Times reported February 26:On a Feb. 18 call with advocates and lawyers, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas grew frustrated when asked about other cases in which border authorities expelled injured migrants under Title 42 [anti-epidemic rules] despite some being unable to walk after falling off the wall, according to [Linda] Corchado, who was on the call.“He was just appalled that people are jumping the wall,” Corchado said. “The point is with Title 42, that’s what happens … people are getting more and more desperate.”Corchado is the Texas-based director of legal services at Las Américas Immigrant Advocacy Center. She is also representing other migrants who were rescued from a snowstorm as they tried to sneak into American’s homeland.“So they’re trying to climb up the wall on the Mexican side, and they’re falling down and getting injured — and so we’re supposed to collect them all and bring them here for medical treatment?” asked Rosemary Jenks of NumbersUSA, “the nation’s largest grassroots immigration-reduction organization.” She told Breitbart News:Everything this administration has done so far on immigration is encouraging people to come north. Now, if they say, “Well, you can try to climb the wall and fall down and we’ll bring you in,” then we’ll see more of that,  If they say, “Risk dehydration in the desert,  and we’ll bring you in,” then we’ll see more of that. If they say “Risk frostbite coming in and we’ll bring you in and take care of you,” we’ ‘ll see more of that.It is absolutely cruelty, not only to the migrants themselves, it’s cruel to the American workers who are going to have to compete for jobs, and the American taxpayers who are going to have to foot the bill for all of it.“This is globalism on steroids — they’re actively trying to erase America,” Jenks said.Corchado has other border-crossing clients, including:an Indigenous couple from Guatemala who were caught in the winter weather … having nearly died from hypothermia. Their home was destroyed in recent hurricanes that slammed the Northern Triangle. In the hospital, the husband kept describing over and over how his wife told him she couldn’t feel her heartbeat anymore, instructing him on how she wanted their kids to be raised, Corchado said. Both tested positive for COVID-19.At first, [Customs and Borde Protection] CBP officials indicated to the couple that they could be expelled under Title 42 once discharged. But late Wednesday, without notice to Corchado, the hospital released them, and Border Patrol detained them. A CBP supervisor said Thursday that they wouldn’t be expelled and their asylum claims would be considered, according to communications shared with The Times.On March 1, the Los Angeles Times also reported that an injured migrant would be released into California after both of his hands were severely damaged by frostbite while he was sneaking across the border.ICYMI updates @latimes on Douglas, 21yo Guatemalan in hospital likely to lose both hands after crossing the border during Texas winter storm: CBP gave papers Sunday allowing for release from custody to California when discharged, soon as today, per uncle https://t.co/RzYPRFqjn6— Molly O'Toole (@mollymotoole) March 1, 2021On February 28, former President Donald Trump slammed Biden’s policies are cruel. “What the Biden administration is doing to push young migrants into the hands of human traffickers and coyotes is dangerous, immoral, and indefensible,” he said in a speech at the CPAC conference, adding:Perhaps worst of all, Joe Biden’s decision to cancel border security has single-handedly launched a youth migrant crisis that is enriching child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and some of the most evil people on the planet. You see it every day, just turn on the news. You’ll see it every day.Under my administration, we stopped the child smugglers, we dismantle the criminal cartels, we greatly limited drug and human trafficking to a level that nobody actually thought was possible … But the Biden administration has put the vile coyotes back in business, and it has done so in a very, very big way.Mayorkas and other officials are aware of the dangers migrants undergo as they try to accept President Joe Biden’s offer of asylum, jobs, and residency.“We’ve also begun to rebuild a process for young people to be able to access avenues of protection without having to take the perilous journey,” Mayorkas told reporters March during a White House press conference. “We have begun to develop and rebuild of [an Obama] program to reunify individuals with families here in the United States, as was once the case. ”However, Mayorkas shrugged off a question asking about migrants headed north expecting to push their way through Biden’s decreased border protections. Officials, he said, are telling migrants to wait until Biden’s deputies rebuild the migration process system, adding:We are flooding the [media] space with that critical message. I cannot overstate its criticality for the wellbeing of those very individuals who are thinking of coming. Not to mention the wellbeing and stability of the border as we seek to rebuild it from its dismantled state … It’s very difficult to know those whom we have successfully deterred, but our understanding is that it does work, to a degree, certainly with certain aspects of the population.“We need individuals to wait, and I will say that they will wait with a goal in mind, and that is our ability to rebuild as quickly as possible a system so that they don’t have to take the dangerous journey, and we can enable them to access humanitarian relief from their countries of origin,” he said.Trump reclaims the moral high ground by spotlighting the huge cost to migrants (& Central America) of the progressives' extraction-migration policy.

334,"Average wages rose sharply in 2019 in then-President Donald Trump’s go-go economy and also rose again in 2020 as China’s coronavirus pushed many lower-income people out of jobs, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute (EPI).The spikes reveal the Trump gains at the 2019 end of the EPI chart, released February 24 in the group’s annual “The State of Working America 2020 wages report.”Source: Economic Policy Institute“Men at the middle and bottom of the wage distribution saw their wages rise in 2019: a 2.6% increase at the 50th percentile and a striking 5.7% increase at the 10th percentile, along with a 4.2% increase at the 20th percentile,” according to the organization’s 2019 yearly report, The State of Working America 2019.”Wages rose rapidly during the 2020 coronavirus crash, in large part because many lower-wage workers lost their jobs and were pushed out of the annual wage calculations. The new report says:Wages grew [in coronarivus year 2020] largely because more than 80% of the 9.6 million net jobs lost in 2020 were jobs held by wage earners in the bottom 25% of the wage distribution. The exit of 7.9 million low-wage workers from the workforce, coupled with the addition of 1.5 million jobs in the top half of the wage distribution, skewed average wages upward. [Emphasis added]Pro-migration progressives control the EPI, so the reports typically ignore the wage-cutting impact of labor inflation caused by the arrival of millions of legal and illegal blue-collar and white-collar migrants.But the group also provides much useful information about slow wage growth since 1990 when President George H.W. Bush and Sen. Ted Kennedy collaborated to double legal immigration and dramatically expand white-collar visa workers.The inflated supply of workers, consumers, and renters helped employers pocket the huge gains from routine productivity increases. That economic transfer spiked the stock market for investors and also pushed many states toward Democrat dominance.Source: Economic Policy InstituteThe EPI’s data echoes other reports.“Families near the bottom of the income and wealth distributions generally continued to experience substantial gains in median and mean net worth between 2016 and 2019,” says a September 2020 report by the Federal Reserve banking system. The report, titled “Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2016 to 2019: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,” said:During the three years between the beginning of the 2016 and 2019 surveys, real gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, and the civilian unemployment rate fell from 5.0 percent to 3.8 percent.…Families at the top of the income and wealth distributions experienced very little, if any, growth in median and mean net worth between 2016 and 2019 after experiencing large gains between 2013 and 2016 [during the Obama administration].The report notes that college graduates did poorly from 2016 to 2019. The family median income level of high school graduates rose by six percent, while the median or midpoint income of college graduates fell by two percent, according to the report.The 2019 wage gains were also aided by raises in minimum wages in many states. The enforced wage gains did cut jobs because the economy was booming, and Trump largely blocked business demands for more legal immigration.In January 2021, a construction industry CEO lamented that Trump’s deputies forced him to hire Americans instead of illegal aliens. Stan Marek, the owner of Marek Brothers, a Houston-based construction firm that has employed many illegal migrants, complained:They were let go because of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] audits or Social Security No Matches, or insurance audits or whatever, and yet they’re 11 to 12 million people in this country on payrolls sending in about $6 to $7 billion a year of Social Security [payments] that they would never get. These ICE audits have taken millions of people off of payrolls and dumped them into the underground economy where they’re working for cash and not paying taxes.In 2020, many business groups lined up behind Joe Biden partly because of his promise to dramatically accelerate the inflow of migrants in the United State’s consumer economy.Joe Biden's would-be immigration chief says a 'comprehensive' immig. deal would raise wages.

335,"President Joe Biden’s welcome for migrants is immoral and heartless to both Americans and migrants, former President Donald Trump told the CPAC event in Florida on February 28.“What the Biden administration is doing to push young migrants into the hands of human traffickers and coyotes is dangerous, immoral, and indefensible,” he said. “These radical immigration policies aren’t just illegal. They’re immoral. They’re heartless. And they are a betrayal of our nation’s core values,” he said. “Our party is based on love for America.”Trump’s comments reverse the progressives’ claim of moral superiority for their policy of aiding migrants. But those policies are extracting poor migrants from undeveloped Central America, through a Hunger Games-like deadly obstacle course, for use in the U.S. economy as cheap replacement workers, taxpayer-aided consumers, and high-occupancy renters.Trump continued:Perhaps worst of all, Joe Biden’s decision to cancel border security has single-handedly launched a youth migrant crisis that is enriching child smugglers, vicious criminal cartels, and some of the most evil people on the planet.

336,"The growth of manufacturing in the U.S. accelerated further in February, a survey by the Institute for Supply Management showed Monday.The ISM Manufacturing Report on Business PMI jumped at 60.8 in February, up from 58.7 in January. That’s the highest level since August 2018 and indicates a powerful expansion for the manufacturing sector.The manufacturing sector figure suggests that the overall economy expanded for the ninth month in a row after the economy shrank in in March, April, and May of 2020.The reading beats the forecast of 58.9 from economists polled by Econoday.“Another month of strong production growth suggests that the US manufacturing sector is close to fully recovering the output lost to the pandemic last year, and a renewed surge in optimism suggests the recovery has much further to run,” said Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said.The IHS Markit index, which competes with the ISM index, dipped a bit in February but remains at a very strong level and indicates a marked upturn in the health of the sector. One notable difference is that the IHS index is more heavily skewed to smaller companies serving a domestic customer base while the ISM index is tilted toward bigger companies with global reach.“Although the rate of overall growth eased, it was the second-fastest since April 2010 and was supported by sharp increases in output and new orders,” Williamson said.The indexes are both produced from a survey of manufacturing supply executives. Scores above 50 indicate that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding, while below 50 indicates contraction.There are some hints of overheating in the February numbers.  The ISM prices index rose for the ninth consecutive month, up to 86. The institute said this indicates continued supplier pricing power and scarcity of supply chain goods. The bond market turned volatile last week over fears that another round of stimulus as large as the $1.9 trillion package proposed by the Biden administration.“Prices charged for a wide variety of goods coming out of factories are consequently rising, which will likely feed through to higher consumer inflation,” Williamson said.Demand for goods is up. The New Orders Index climbed to 64.8 from 61.1. That is  “a strong level” of growth,  according to Timothy Fiore, chair of the ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee.The production index rose to 63.2 compared with 60.7 in JanuaryThe employment index jumped to 54.4, up 1.8 points. But employers continue to complain about not being able to find enough workers despite high levels of unemployment.“Issues with absenteeism, short-term shutdowns to sanitize facilities, and difficulties in hiring workers remain challenges and continue to cause strains that limit manufacturing-growth potential,” Fiore said.Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, five — Chemical Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; Computer & Electronic Products; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products — registered strong growth in February. Petroleum & Coal Products—which suffered shutdowns during February’s cold snap—moderately contracted.

338,"U.S. construction spending rose by more than twice the level expected in January, highlighting the ongoing strength of the U.S. housing market.Construction spending jumped 1.7 percent from December’s revised level to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.52 trillion, the Commerce Department reported Monday. That was better than the eight-tenths of a percent forecast by economists.The January figure is 5.8 percent higher than a year prior.Residential construction was been driven much higher by a sharp increase in demand for single-family homes and a shrinking supply of existing homes for sale. This rose 2.5 percent from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $713.0 billion in January. Compared with a year ago, residential construction spending is up an astounding 21.1.Private sector construction spending on single-family homes hit $376.2 billion, up 3 percent for the month and up 24.2 from a year ago.Nonresidential construction has been weak since the pandemic struck. It rose 0.9 percent in January but is still down 5 percent compared with a year ago. Absent government construction spending, nonresidential construction is down 1o.1 percent from last year.The hard hit categories include hotel construction, down 22.7 percent from a year ago, and recreation and amusement construction, down 22.1 percent. Both grew in January, with lodging construction rising 0.7 percent and amusement construction rising 1.6 percent.Government spending on construction is up 2.9 percent from a year ago and rose 1.6 percent from a month earlier.

339,"The socialist government of Argentina imposed a one-time wealth tax on its citizens this week, allegedly to offset the country’s crippling debt, which has worsened during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.Argentine citizens with assets of more than 200 million pesos ($2.3 million) must pay about three percent in taxes on assets declared within Argentina and over five percent on assets held abroad. The one-time special levy will apply to around 12,000 people in the South American country. Argentine senators passed the so-called “millionaires’ tax” by 42 votes to 26 in December.Argentina, which has long struggled with immense debt, found its economy in dire straits last year due, in part, to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The country’s gross domestic product plummeted 11.8 percent in 2020, while Argentina’s poverty rate jumped from “35.4 percent in the first half of 2019 to 40.9 percent during the same period in 2020,” according to a recent report by the Washington Post.The Argentine federal government responded to the spike in poverty levels by increasing expenditures on social programs and cash handouts to the poor during the pandemic. Argentina’s socialist President Alberto Fernández proposed the wealth tax bill last year as a means for the government to offset this increased spending. The levy’s supporters say it could generate up to $3.5 billion from the estimated 12,000 people in Argentina it would apply to.“We’re talking about 0.02 percent of the population,” Carlos Heller, a member of the Chamber of Deputies from Buenos Aires who co-sponsored the wealth tax bill, told the Washington Post last week. “It’s a small contribution we’re asking from the richest Argentines.”Opponents of the wealth tax have criticized it as “confiscatory.” The Argentine Rural Society has warned that the tax, which the government advertised as a “one-time special levy,” could become permanent in the future.Argentina’s revenue service (AFIP) announced on February 26 that it plans to criminally prosecute a select number of the 12,000 people affected by the wealth tax for alleged tax evasion. The AFIP warned that it will “initiate criminal complaints” against an estimated 2,500 of the wealth tax’s payers for “aggravated [tax] evasion” and will file the cases on March 30.Wealth taxes often have negative side effects that undermine their stated intent, such as driving holders of wealth out of a nation. A long-standing wealth tax in France forced an estimated 42,000 of the nation’s richest citizens to flee the country between 2000 and 2012. French President Emmanuel Macron repealed the wealth tax in 2018 after it was blamed for not only the wealth exodus, but also an increase in alleged incidents of tax evasion.The wealth exodus caused by France’s “solidarity” tax cost the French government “twice as much revenue as the total ultimately yielded by the tax,” according to an analysis of the measure by French economist Eric Pichet.EconomyLatin AmericaNational SecurityArgentinacoronaviruseconomywealth tax.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
340,"Coyotes will deliver perhaps 13,000 foreign children and job-seeking teenagers to the U.S. border in May, according to a leaked report to Axios.com.But the leak is intended to be a “self-fulfilling prophecy,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies.President Joe Biden’s officials, she said, are leaking the warnings even as they strip President Donald Trump’s border protection because they want to create “a perpetual crisis that will normalize the flow of large numbers of people.”“Having a huge number of people who are showing up at the southern border is one of the justifications that they will put forward for letting them in,” she added.The policy of “extraction migration” from Central America is harming Americans’ communities and migrant-sending countries while also enriching the trafficking networks that deliver the adult and child migrants into the U.S. consumer economy, she said.Biden’s progressive deputies “are oblivious to the reality that their pet policies are enriching criminal smuggling organizations, dislocating communities in these countries, and putting children at risk,” she said.Axios.com reported February 26:A Customs and Border Protection staffer [from the department of Homeland Security, DHS] told top administration officials Thursday the agency is projecting a peak of 13,000 unaccompanied [sic] children crossing the border in May, sources directly familiar with the discussion told Axios.“CBP chief of staff Lise Clavel provided the border-crossing projection.” Clavel is a former campaign staffer for Beto O’Rourke and Mike Bloomberg, and a former manager at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.The predicted 13,000 young migrants are in addition to the large inflows of single adult migrants and the “family unit” migrants.The 13,000 young migrants are legally described as “Unaccompanied Alien Children,” even though they are accompanied by paid coyotes from their homes to the border, and even though many are older teenagers seeking U.S. jobs.Biden’s welcome is encouraging coyotes to bring more of the “UACs” to the border. In the first four months of 2020, 12,000 UACs were delivered by coyotes. The first four months of 2021 showed a 64 percent rise to almost 20,000 deliveries.During the Thursday meeting, officials talked about reopening Trump-era facilities to help process the migrants legally into the United States, said the Axios report.Biden’s progressive officials are willing to reopen Trump-era facilities — despite TV-magnified theatrical jeers from migration advocates and from right-of-center news outlets — that Biden is reviving Trump’s “kid in cage” policies. But Biden is using the processing facilities to provide the migrants with residency documents, work permits, and legal paperwork so they can win permanent residency to compete for jobs, homes, and resources needed by Americans.For example, Reuters reported February 25:On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reopened an emergency shelter in Texas and is also considering reopening a controversial facility in Florida, a sign of the scramble to find housing for the children. Shelter capacity was greatly reduced due to coronavirus social distancing, and existing facilities are close to full.HHS, which oversees shelters for migrant children, is in the process of switching to a new database that could cut hours or days from the time it takes to perform background checks for sponsors, said a department official who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations.The report by Axios noted “there was no discussion [at the Thursday meeting] of U.S.-based policies or practices that would work to deter migrants, such as reinstating the use of an emergency public health order to quickly deport migrant kids.”The projected 13,000 migrants in May are usually described as “kids” by pro-migration media outlets, but most are job-seeking teenagers, said Vaughan:There a couple of different things we know about this population. One is that they often are the children of adults who are already living in the country illegally who pays a smuggler to bring their kids here, especially when they are old enough to also work.Most of them are teens, aged 17 or 18, Some are older and are pretending to be 17.In addition, they are kids who have been sent by their families back in Central America to join family or friends who are already here, to get settled in the hope that the parents and the rest of the family team come join them later, or at least, that this teenager — who’s expected to help support the family — will be able to send back earnings.“Honestly, I think almost everyone in the system knows that most of the [migrant] teens are coming to work and send money back home,” Maria Woltjen, executive director and founder of the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, told a reporter for ProPublica. “They want to help their parents,” she told ProPublica for a November 2020 article:Around Urbana-Champaign, the home of the University of Illinois, school district officials say children and adolescents lay shingles, wash dishes and paint off-campus university apartments. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, an indigenous Guatemalan labor leader has heard complaints from adult workers in the fish-packing industry who say they’re losing their jobs to 14-year-olds. In Ohio, teenagers work in dangerous chicken plants.…Though most of the teens interviewed for this story are now 18, they agreed to speak on the condition that they not be fully identified and that their employers not be named because they feared losing their jobs, harming their immigration cases or facing criminal penalties.Some began to work when they were just 13 or 14, packing the candy you find by the supermarket register, cutting the slabs of raw meat that end up in your freezer and baking, in industrial ovens, the pastries you eat with your coffee. Garcia, who is 18 now, was 15 when he got his first job at an automotive parts factory.“Teachers will tell you the same thing,” Vaughan said. “Most of the boys show up in October when the landscaping season is over, and they stay in school until about April, and then they drop out again to go back to work in the landscaping companies.”Joe Biden's deputies blame crime & poverty for the migrant wave at his border — even as many migrants say they rationally decided to take Biden's offers of jobs, asylum, & healthcare. Besides, who would decline his offer of citizenship-via-amnesty? https://t.co/orHffsRB7N— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 11, 2021The UAC pipeline is safe for the teenagers once the coyotes complete the UAC hand-off to Biden’s border agencies. Before the hand-off, the journey can be very deadly.On January 30, the Los Angeles Times reported the death of roughly 13 teenagers who entered the Hunger Games obstacle course, including 15-year-old Robelson Isidro. Gunmen reportedly killed the victims, and their bodies left in a burned-out pickup truck:The [Guatemalan] community has a long history of sending migrants to the United States, and he had uncles who lived there. They had indoor kitchens. They didn’t have to cook outside under a tarp.“He was ashamed,” his mother said in a phone interview. She said he told her: “I’m going to fight to make my dreams come true. I have to get my siblings ahead in life. I’m going to get them out of poverty.”His uncles [in the United States had] wired him money to make the journey north.“The administration is trying to justify its lenient border policies as humanitarianism,” said Vaughan. “But they are facilitating a trade of children who are being trafficked here openly  … nothing could be more immoral.”“The media are bailing them out,” Vaughan added.  “When [White House spokeswoman] Jen Psaki gets flustered about having to defend these policies, commentators will jump in and say, ‘Oh, but you’re reuniting families.'”“It’s not going to stop the flow; it’s just going to launder it … Every policy they adopt is actually incentivizing more people to come,” Vaughn said.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950’s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.How to smuggle 1 million people into the US?First, create a migrant crisis at the border, declare your surprise, then 'fix' the problem by using taxpayer funds to move migrants to new homes in the US.

341,"The Heritage Foundation exposed 11 of the most revolutionary demands in the Democrats’ so-called Equality Act, which would force Americans to accept the transgender ideology’s far-reaching claim that each person’s legal sex is determined by their inner feelings of “gender identity,” not by their measurable biology.Heritage reported:The proposed Equality Act of 2021 (H.R. 5) would make mainstream beliefs about marriage, biological facts about sex differences, and many sincerely held beliefs punishable under the law. The Equality Act makes discrimination the law of the land by forcing Americans to conform to government-mandated beliefs under the threat of life-ruining financial and criminal penalties. Presented as a bill with commonsense and decent protections against discrimination, H.R. 5 is anything but. The Equality Act politicizes medicine and education and demolishes existing civil rights and constitutional freedoms.The paper describes the 11 myths pushed by its progressive supporters — and then details the reality behind the progressive myths. Myth 1: The Equality Act Simply Punishes Discrimination Against People Who Identify as Gay or TransgenderFact: The Equality Act—introduced as H.R. 5 in the House of Representatives on February 18, 2021—makes mainstream beliefs about marriage, as well as basic biological facts about sex differences, punishable under the law …Myth 2: The Equality Act Preserves Religious FreedomFact: The Equality Act guts the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and threatens constitutional freedoms by eliminating conscience protections from the Civil Rights Act. If enacted, H.R. 5 would force employers, medical professionals, educators, and religious organizations to allow men into women’s shelters, pay for or perform sex-change operations, and engage in speech that violates their consciences …Myth 3: The Equality Act Does Not Expand the Scope of Federal Civil Rights LawFact: By expanding the definition of “public accommodations” under Title II of the Civil Rights Act to include “any establishment that provides a good, service, or program, including a store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services,” many more individuals and establishments would, in fact, become liable for discrimination claims, including doctors who do not want to perform abortions …Myth 4: The Equality Act Is Irrelevant to AbortionFact: H.R. 5 endangers unborn children. The Equality Act opens the door to taxpayer funding for elective abortions, which the vast majority of Americans oppose, regardless of political affiliation. The bill does not contain any conscience protections for those with moral or religious objections to paying for or performing abortions. It also takes away judicial relief by blocking claims based on the RFRA …Myth 5: The Equality Act Is Good for Women and Upholds Title IX of the Education Amendments Act, Which Prohibits Sex Discrimination Against Girls and WomenFact: The Equality Act’s changes to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act do not uphold Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments Act. Gender-identity policies will require biological males to be permitted to participate in female-only activities …Myth 6: Safety and Privacy in Sex-Specific Spaces Will Not Be DiminishedFact: All single-sex spaces will be open to both sexes under the Equality Act. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity rules to Title III of the Civil Rights Act on “public facilities” as well as to public accommodations (Title II) and federal funding (Title VI). This would create a nationwide transgender policy in single-sex facilities …Myth 7: The Equality Act Treats All Students Fairly, Promotes Inclusion, and Cannot Affect School Curricula.Fact: By adding sexual orientation and gender-identity rules to the Civil Rights Act’s Title IV on “desegregation of public education,” the Equality Act could pave the way for K–12 federal courts to require sexual orientation and gender-identity curricula the same way they required black history curricula …Myth 8: Doctors Will Not Be Forced to Perform Sex-Change Operations or Prescribe Hormones for “Gender Affirmation”Fact: As a result of the expanding definition of public accommodations, as well as changing federal funding requirements, doctors (and counselors) could be punished for treating gender dysphoria according to their own best medical judgment. Even a referral to another doctor could be a violation of the Civil Rights Act …Myth 9: Parental Rights Will Remain UnchangedFact: The Equality Act’s politicization of medicine and education through gender ideology will undermine parental rights. Since most schools will be pressured to comply with sexual-orientation and gender-identity policies, parents will have limited educational choices for their children. Those who do not believe that their daughters should have to compete against biological males in sports …Myth 10: The Equality Act Helps Children in Need of Foster Homes and AdoptionFact: The Equality Act hurts vulnerable children by punishing faith-based adoption and foster-care agencies that believe that every child deserves both a mother and a father and that children’s bodies should not be irreversibly harmed by hormonal or surgical interventions due to gender dysphoria …Myth 11: The Supreme Court’s Decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, Requires the Equality Act’s Changes to Civil Rights LawFact: The Equality Act goes far beyond the Supreme Court’s 2020 Bostock ruling. While Bostock invented a misguided theory of sex discrimination in employment law, it did not redefine “sex” to include sexual orientation and gender identity … Because Bostock was limited to employment, it said nothing about schools, sports, or medicine. The Equality Act adds sexual orientation and gender identity to all of them.I remember 2020 when the Democrats' described themselves as 'the party of science.'But when their transgender nominee gets questioned on science & ethics, the Dems (& media) become the party of dodge-the-question indignation.https://t.co/dWCPNQuaTw— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 26, 2021EconomyImmigrationPoliticsadoptionFirst AmendmentGender Dysphoriagender identityHeritage FoundationReligious freedomTitle VI of the Civil Rights ActTransgender.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

347,"President Joe Biden’s amnesty plan will spike Social Security spending by “hundreds of billions” over the next few decades, according to a forecast by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).The February 22 report, titled “Amnesty Would Cost the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds Hundreds of Billions of Dollars,” says:The new taxes paid by the average amnesty recipient amount to only half of the $94,500 noted above. The net effect of amnesty is therefore $140,330 [in Social Security benefits] minus $47,250 [in paid taxes], which is about $93,000 per recipient. In any large-scale amnesty, in which millions of illegal immigrants gain legal status, it is easy to see how the net cost could reach into the hundreds of billions of dollars.The predicted $93,000 per person cost would be a financial burden for taxpayers — but would be a giveaway to business groups because the Social Security payments will be converted into purchases of consumer products, healthcare services, medical drugs, apartments, and food.At least 11 million people — perhaps 20 million — are living illegally in the United States. The number rises as people overstay their visas, evade deportation orders, or sneak over the border — but it also falls as some migrants get deported, leave, or find ways to get green cards via the rolling “Adjustment of Status” process.But taxpayers’ expenses are also economic gains for business groups and investors. In January 2020, a coalition of business groups sued deputies for President Donald Trump after he reduced the inflow of poor migrants into the U.S. consumer market, saying:Because [green-card applicants] will receive fewer public benefits under the Rule, they will cut back their consumption of goods and services, depressing demand throughout the economy …The New American Economy Research Fund calculates that, on top of the $48 billion in income that is earned by individuals who will be affected by the Rule—and that will likely be removed from the U.S. economy—the Rule will cause an indirect economic loss of more than $33.9 billion … Indeed, the Fiscal Policy Institute has estimated that the decrease in SNAP and Medicaid enrollment under the Rule could, by itself, lead to economic ripple effects of anywhere between $14.5 and $33.8 billion, with between approximately 100,000 and 230,000 jobs lost … Health centers alone would be forced to drop as many as 6,100 full-time medical staff.CIS promised a more detailed report:This is just a rough estimate. We are currently working on a detailed model that will provide more precise costs for both Social Security and Medicare. Again, however, any reasonable calculation will produce a large cost, simply because amnesty will convert so many outside contributors into actual beneficiaries.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and to the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950’s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.However, Biden’s officials have been broadcasting their desire to change border policies to help extract more migrants from Central America for the U.S. economy.

351,"President Joe Biden’s deputies will bypass the media’s clickbait focus on border-backlogged “kids in cages” by simply flying and bussing more Central American migrants to homes through the United States.The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told Breitbart News that its Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has:…authorized programs to pay transport fees for unaccompanied children (including airline tickets), including escort transport (where necessary by airline or ORR policy) in order to facilitate release of children to approved sponsors.ORR care providers are authorized to use program funds to purchase airline tickets in the event that a sponsor is not able to pay fees associated with commercial airfare, and a child’s physical release would be otherwise delayed.“This isn’t about a backlog,” said Rosemary Jenks, policy director at NumbersUSA. She continued:This is about Biden’s policies creating a border surge … They’re getting exactly what we all knew they were going to get which is more people coming across, including more unaccompanied children. So now they’re trying to figure out what to do with them because you know AOC [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, (D-NY)] and others are so unhappy with their “kids in containers” policy that they’ve got to fly them away from the border so nobody notices them.“The administration wants open borders — they want anyone from around the world to come here as fast as they possibly can,” she said. But the resulting rush of migrants is forcing officials to hide the unpopular migration as it arrives at the border.The surge of migrants will not be easy to hide, she added. “Former President Obama knows that because when he was flying the unaccompanied children all over the country, all hell broke loose and governors started complaining, and citizens started complaining. I don’t see how anyone with a memory .. would call that a win.”On February 23, the Washington Times reported:U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is scrambling to find bigger airplanes and figure out more ground transport capacity for soaring numbers of illegal immigrants, and is even talking with a company that runs “Man Camps” for oil workers in Texas to see whether it will rent bed space for the incoming wave of illegal immigrants.New Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ICE that cost is no issue, and to cancel contracts and sign new ones without worry about the price tag, according to the email from ICE Chief of Staff Timothy Perry. Mr. Mayorkas said he is also pondering diverting money from the border wall “to backfill budgets later,” the email said.…“ICE should increase the cadence of its transport and arrange for individuals to complete their processing and ATD’ing at processing centers north of the border,” he wrote. ATD, or Alternatives to Detention, means those migrants will be released into communities with conditions like regular check-ins with officers.Meanwhile, the pro-migration advocates who slammed Trump because of the 2018 and 2019 congestion at the border stations are giving Biden a political pass. The Washington Post reported February 25:“The word I would preach here is patience,” said J.

352,"Consumers were a bit less optimistic in February, data from the University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiment showed Friday.The index for consumer sentiment dipped to 76.8 from 79 in January. A midmonth reading, however, had sentiment at 76.2 and economists had forecast a reading of 76.4, so the actual results were better than expected.“Despite a small gain in late February, consumer sentiment was slightly lower for the entire month than in January,” said Richard Curtin, the survey’s chief economist.The dip in confidence came from households in the lower end of incomes, Curtin said.“All of February’s loss was due to households with incomes below $75,000, with the declines mainly concentrated in future economic prospects,” Curtin said. “The worst of the pandemic may be nearing its end, but few consumers anticipate the type of persistent and robust economic growth that restores employment conditions to the very positive pre-pandemic levels.”Consumers are increasingly worried about inflation. The year ahead inflation rate was expected to be 3.3 percent in February, up from 3.0 percent last month and 2.5 percent in December.“While consumers clearly anticipate a spurt in inflation in the year ahead, the overall evidence does not indicate the emergence of an inflationary psychology that makes the expectation of inflation a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Curtin said. “The key lesson learned from the last inflationary era is that it is easy to underestimate the strength of inflationary psychology, and correspondingly, it is easy to overestimate the ability of economic policies to bring an end to inflationary psychology.”EconomyConsumer Sentiment.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
353,"New claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week, the latest sign that the economy has strengthened more than expected as vaccination spread across the U.S.The Department of Labor estimated that 730,000 people filed for unemployment benefits last week, a steep decline from the previous week’s 841,000.Jobless claims can be volatile week to week. In particular, they may have been held back last week by the cold snap and snow across much of the country. To smooth out the volatility, economists look to the four-week average of claims.  These fell by 20,500 to 807,750 and the previous week was revised down by 5,000 from 833,250 to 828,250.The faster than expected recovery of the labor market could have political fallout. Some lawmakers may see a decline in jobless claims—which are a proxy for layoffs—as a reason to cut back on the covid relief spending plans of the Biden administration.The total number of continued weeks claimed for benefits in all programs for the week ending February 6 was 19,042,686, an increase from the prior week.Economy.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

356,"Rising bond yields may put pressure on lawmakers to tone down the $1.9 trillion spending plan.The yield curve—the difference in yields for short-term and long-term debt—has sharpened dramatically in recent weeks as investors have sold off bonds maturing five-years or more into the future while shorter-term bonds have held steady.This is likely an indication that investors think economic growth, inflation, or both will be stronger than they believed at the start of the month. Economic data has suggested that the labor market remains sluggish but most other parts of the economy are outperforming forecasts.The yield on the one-year Treasury is slightly below where it was on February 1. The yield on the two year is exactly where it was on that day.

357,"President Joe Biden’s deputies have restarted the federal program to deliver foreign youths and children to their illegal-migrant members in the United States — yet they are being taunted for reviving memories of the “kids in cages” furor created in 2018 by Democrats for use against President Donald Trump.“It’s a media reflex to talk about it in this way,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. The media default to the 2018 “kid in cages” narrative is also evidence of lazy journalism, he said, adding: It’s just sort of the easier thing: “Look, haha, you guys have kids in cages too! Grandpa President Dummy is a liar!” … and you know, it’s kind of tempting because the [Biden officials] are hypocritical jerks.But the underlying story Biden’s officials are voluntarily restarting the federal policy of extraction migration that has pushed and pulled roughly 3.5 million migrants into the United States’ economy since 2010, via a de facto obstacle course migration system for blue-collar migrants — a chaotic Hunger Games trail of loans,  coyotes, cartels, rape, deserts, weather, border laws, barriers, rescuers, transport, judges, and cheap-labor employers.Migrants who survive the obstacle course win the progressives’ prize of release into the United States where they boost the U.S. economy by competing for the jobs and housing needed by lower-skilled, lower-income Americans. So far, about 12 percent have won the Golden Prize of U.S. residency, while only about half have been sent home.This chaotic and deadly federal policy of extraction migration includes several legally distinct streams, including adults who sneak across the border, the economic migrants who offer weak asylum claims, and the adult who bring kids so they can squeeze through the Flores loophole.One of those streams is the growing population of so-called “Unaccompanied Alien Children” (UACs) that are being welcomed by Biden and his deputies.The UACs consist of two main sub-groups: Teenagers looking for work to support their Central American families, and the children and teenagers who are getting delivered to their illegal-migrant parents in the United States.This UAC stream is very different from the so-called “kids in cages” that media outlets spotlighted on Tuesday.The claim of “kid in cages” was created and successfully used by Democrats as an emotional club to whack Trump’s anti-migration border policies. The media-magnified club conflated two categories of children and teenagers.The first “kids in cages” category was the just-arrived children and teenagers kept at bare-bones border stations run by the Customs and Border Protection agency. Often these children were protected from other migrants by chain-link partitions while they and their parents recovered and were processed for a few days.This category includes UAC as well as children traveling with migrant families. It was spotlighted by Breitbart when the migrants appeared during President Barack Obama’s terms.The second “kids in cages” category was the children who were temporarily held in detention while their illegal-migrant parents were prosecuted under President Donald Trump’s enforcement of the nation’s border-migration laws. The enforcement allowed the border agency to convict their parents for border crossing, which would allow rapid deportation if the parents crossed again. However, pro-migration lawyers joined with the anti-Trump media to turn this separated-kids group into a passion play for Democratic voters, so creating a massive polling hot-spot for Democrats in 2018 and 2020.In contrast, the supposedly-unaccompanied UACs get their own-fast track migration process, courtesy of a 2o08 law.This track takes the UACs from their coyotes at the border to U.S. border officers, and then to shelters run by civilians working for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HHS  shelters are comfortable, allow phone calls, classrooms, and playgrounds where government carers prepare to hand the children over to their vetted “sponsors” in the United States.The vast majority of the UAC sponsors are the adults who paid coyotes to deliver the children to the federal agencies at the border. The vast majority are also migrant parents, uncles, and aunts who are living illegally — or temporarily legally —  in Michigan, Oklahoma, Virginia, Tennessee, and many other places in the United States. Since 2010, more than 300,000 children and teens have been carefully relayed from Central America to their parents by this joint federal-coyote operation.But Trump shut this UAC pipeline down in 2020.He used a healthcare law — plus diplomatic agreements with Central American countries — to immediately return new UACs to their extended families in their homelands. Trump’s shutdown quickly reduced the coyotes’ transport-for-hire business to a trickle.Biden’s deputies now admit they are reopening the UAC pipeline — despite the myriad predictable harms to the children and youths, plus huge economic and political damage to their home countries and to Americans.“We are in a circumstance where we are not going to expel unaccompanied minors at the border,” White House spokesman Jennifer Psaki said February 23:That would be inhumane. That is not what we’re going to do here as an administration. We need to find places that are safe under COVID protocols for kids to be where they can have access to education, health and mental services, consistent with their best interest.This process prompted officials to reopen a tent city in Carrizo Springs, Tex. On February 22, a  Washington Post reporter burbled her enthusiasm about the pipeline, which now holds about 7,000 children and teenagers:At the 66-acre site, groups of beige trailers encircle a giant white dining tent, a soccer field and a basketball court. There is a bright blue hospital tent with white bunk beds inside. A legal services trailer has the Spanish word “Bienvenidos,” or welcome, on a banner on its roof. There are trailers for classrooms, a barber shop, a hair salon. The facility has its own ambulances and firetrucks, as well as its own water supply.The operation is based on a federal emergency management system, Weber said. The trailers are labeled with names such as Alpha, Charlie and Echo. Staff members wear matching black-and-white T-shirts displaying their roles: disaster case manager, incident support, emergency management.The most colorful trailer is at the entryway, where flowers, butterflies and handmade posters still hang on its walls from Carrizo’s first opening in 2019.300K+ child & youth migrants have been split from their families by Congress' unanimously clueless 2008 vote to create the 'UAC' pipeline into the US. Trump's DoJ has a draft fix, but Dems, biz & media are fighting to continue the family-splitting pipeline https://t.co/mv8YyVxjzq— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 4, 2019The site is intended to hold about 700 teenage UACs, including some who are older than their claimed maximum age of 17.The Washington Post report helped trigger a wave of taunts and jeers by Republicans eager for emotional payback after getting lashed by the “kids in cages” meme from Democrats and their media allies.At the daily briefing, Psaki was asked  by a reporter about the apparent hypocrisy:Kamala Harris said that this facility — putting people in this facility was a human rights abuse committed by the United States government.  And Joe Biden said, “Under Trump, there have been horrifying scenes of border” — “at the border of kids being kept in cages.” Now it’s not under Trump — it’s under Biden.Psaki noted that the UACs are being housed so they can be sent to their “sponsors” throughout the United States: “We are not going to expel unaccompanied minors at the border. … Our goal is for them to then be transferred to families or sponsors.”That reminder of Biden’s pro-migration policies spurred the misplaced hypocrisy jeers.The February 23 Fox News headline declared: “Psaki defends reopening of migrant facility for children under Biden: ‘This is not kids being kept in cages’”The New York Post declared:  “White House denies ‘kids in cages’ hypocrisy charge as detention centers reopen.”The reporters did not pressure Psaki on Biden’s choice to restart the extraction-migration policy. Without any pushback, Psaki downplayed Biden’s role in restarting the migration, including his decision to stop deporting the UAC migrants. In the don’t-blame-us passive voice, she said::The challenge here, as you know, is that people are fleeing prosecution.  They’re fleeing very difficult economic circumstances and hardship.  And there hasn’t been enough time to do enough to impact the circumstances on the ground in a number of these communities.And obviously, as these unaccompanied kids come to the border, it’s completely heartbreaking.  We’re not going to expel these kids.  We want to process and get them into facilities as quickly as possible … We need more time to put in place a humane and moral immigration system.But Biden’s welcome is encouraging coyotes to bring more UACs to the border. In the first four months of 2020, 12,000 UACs were delivered. The first four months of 2021 showed a 64 percent rise to almost 20,000 deliveries.Many of the Central American teenagers are coming north to find jobs — not to attend schools as if they were American teenagers finishing out their K-12 education.“Honestly, I think almost everyone in the system knows that most of the [migrant] teens are coming to work and send money back home,” Maria Woltjen, executive director and founder of the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, told a reporter for ProPublica.“They want to help their parents,” she told ProPublica for a November 2020 article:Around Urbana-Champaign, the home of the University of Illinois, school district officials say children and adolescents lay shingles, wash dishes and paint off-campus university apartments. In New Bedford, Massachusetts, an indigenous Guatemalan labor leader has heard complaints from adult workers in the fish-packing industry who say they’re losing their jobs to 14-year-olds. In Ohio, teenagers work in dangerous chicken plants.ProPublica interviewed 15 teenagers and young adults in Bensenville alone who said they work or have worked as minors inside more than two dozen factories, warehouses and food processing facilities in the Chicago suburbs, usually through temporary staffing agencies, and nearly all in situations where federal and state child labor laws would explicitly prohibit their employment.Though most of the teens interviewed for this story are now 18, they agreed to speak on the condition that they not be fully identified and that their employers not be named because they feared losing their jobs, harming their immigration cases or facing criminal penalties.Some began to work when they were just 13 or 14, packing the candy you find by the supermarket register, cutting the slabs of raw meat that end up in your freezer and baking, in industrial ovens, the pastries you eat with your coffee. Garcia, who is 18 now, was 15 when he got his first job at an automotive parts factory.ACLU & judge reopen the 'UAC pipeline' at the border — as ProPublica shows many teenage migrants are heading to illegal & abusive child-labor jobs in the US.So progressives win job losses for Americans, child labor for biz, more $ for cartels & lawyers.https://t.co/R815prNEDd— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) November 20, 2020The UAC pipeline is safe for the teenagers once the coyotes complete their legal hand-off to Biden’s border agencies.  Before the hand-off, the journey can be very deadly.On January 30, the Los Angeles Times reported the death of roughly 13 teenagers who entered the Hunger Games obstacle course, including 15-year-old Robelson Isidro. The victims were reportedly killed by gunmen, and their bodies left in a burned-out pickup truck:The [Guatemalan] community has a long history of sending migrants to the United States, and he had uncles who lived there. They had indoor kitchens. They didn’t have to cook outside under a tarp.“He was ashamed,” his mother said in a phone interview. She said he told her: “I’m going to fight to make my dreams come true. I have to get my siblings ahead in life. I’m going to get them out of poverty.”His uncles [in the United States had] wired him money to make the journey north.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and to the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950’s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.However, Biden’s officials have been broadcasting their desire to refocus the DHS and USCIS on helping to extract more migrants from Central America for the U.S. economy.

358,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the damage the economy has suffered due to the pandemic and stressed that there was still a long way to go to a full recovery.“The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead is highly uncertain,” Powell said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.Powell said that Fed will continue to support the economy with ultralow interest rates and large-scale bond purchases until “substantial further progress has been made.” He added that a full recovery “is likely to take some time.”Several times in his testimony, Powell mentioned that the labor market was still 10 million jobs smaller than it was prepandemic. And he dismissed inflation risk, saying a sustained rise in prices above the Fed’s target is unlikely.Stocks rallied on Powell’s testimony.  By emphasizing the weakness of the economy and saying inflation remains soft, Powell out to rest fears of a policy shift toward raising rates following this month’s rise in bond yields.Some prominent economists have warned that the Biden administration’s spending plans risk overheating the economy. Powell declined to state whether he is in favor of the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion spending bill but did say some fiscal expansion would help the recovery.“I have consistently not taken a position on this bill,” Powell said.“So your opinion is that if we don’t pass the bill, you’re cool with that?” asked Senator John Kennedy (R-La.).“That would be taking a position which is what I said I am not doing,” Powell said.Powell’s focus on the weakness of the economy is at odds with the increasing optimism among many analysts that the economy will grow rapidly later this year. Most economists say they think the Fed’s continued low rates, further government financial aid, and progress in combating the viral pandemic could create a mini-economic boom as soon as this summer. Goldman Sachs thinks the economy will grow at an 11 percent rate in the second quarter and 6.8 percent for the full year.Powell acknowledged the potential for a healthier economy. But he stressed the personal hardships caused by the pandemic, especially for unemployed Americans.“As with overall economic activity, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed,” Powell said. “Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, millions of Americans remain out of work.”Powell’s focus on the economy’s challenges reflects his reluctance to send any signal that the Fed is considering pulling back on its efforts to boost economic growth and hiring. The Fed cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to nearly zero last March in response to the pandemic recession.

And it is the second-highest sales pace since April 2006.“Home sales are continuing to play a part in propping up the economy,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR. “With additional stimulus likely to pass and several vaccines now available, the housing outlook looks solid for this year.”Economists had forecast s decline after a much better than expected December. December was revised down.The supply of homes on the market is very low at just 1.04 million, down almost 26 percent year-over-year in January.This combination of still rising demand and low supply is pushing prices sky-high. The median price of an existing home sold in January was $303,900, a 14.1 percent increase from January 2020. That is the highest January price that the NAR has ever recorded.Homes are selling extraordinarily quickly. On average, an existing home sold in 21 days in January.

366,"President Joe Biden signed an executive order this week revoking former President Donald Trump’s order providing federal funds to apprenticeship programs created by industries, calling for more government-controlled alternatives.In 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13801, Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs (IRAPs). The policy allowed “trade and industry groups, companies, non-profit organizations, unions, and joint labor-management organizations” to create their own apprenticeship programs that would help workers obtain the skills that the economy needed but that universities are not providing, or are providing at a cost that is unaffordable for many Americans.“Registered Apprenticeships,” approved by the government, have been part of U.S. labor policy for decades. Under the Obama administration, these received more funding. But critics argued that the government-controlled model, run by the Department of Labor and with the involvement of labor unions, held back the growth of apprenticeships. The Trump order allowed industries (and unions) to develop their own programs, within regulations but independent of government control.The Washington Post — hardly friendly to the Trump administration — reported that his new policy had bipartisan support:Trump signed an executive order that seeks to reorient and expand ApprenticeshipUSA, a grant program that was previously championed by the Obama administration and has been supported by Democrats and Republicans alike.
The administration’s aim, White House officials say, is to give more flexibility to third parties — including businesses, trade associations and labor unions — to design programs that will offer skills training to those who are seeking jobs for which they are not yet qualified.Under current rules, the Labor Department is too heavy-handed in crafting the programs, they argue.But left-wing groups, and some congressional Democrats, objected to Trump’s order. The Center for American Progress complained that Trump was creating “a parallel track that lacks adequate worker protections” that could allow for “the proliferation of low-quality programs.”Democrats eventually frustrated Trump’s new system, as Bloomberg News noted this week: “Democrats in Congress blocked funding and the implementing regulations weren’t finalized until last year.”Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), the Ranking Member on the House Committee on Education and Labor, objected to Biden’s change in a statement:“President Biden’s move to end IRAPs will kill jobs. Period. Doubling down on an inefficient, 80-year-old system that is unresponsive to workers’ needs is not a solution, it is irresponsible.“In the last four months 131 IRAPs have been created, the vast majority of which are for nursing credentials. Why a party that claims to follow science would limit nursing credentials during a global pandemic is beyond me.“Instead of catering to union bosses and increasing Washington’s overreach into the private sector, we should support and encourage efforts to cut the regulatory red tape that stops too many employers from filling in-demand jobs. Employer-led apprenticeship programs account for more than 80 percent of all apprenticeship programs nationwide. The success of these programs should come as no surprise, employers know best what skills their employees need to excel in the workplace.The Biden White House described his new policy as “expanding registered apprenticeship programs,” with a view to training “diverse, local, well-trained workers who have a choice to join a union.”The White House claimed that industry-run apprenticeships “have fewer quality standards than registered apprenticeship programs” and that they “fail to require the wage progression” that occurs under union-backed, government-run programs.Joel B.

367,"Olivier Blanchard is worried that the Biden administration’s proposed $1.9 trillion covid relief bill is too large and risks igniting unwanted inflation.Blanchard, a Frenchman, is not exactly a household name but he is one of the world’s leading economists. His work is said to be the most cited of any living economist. He was the chief economist at the World Bank from 2008 through 2015. He’s a professor emeritus at MIT and a Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.In other words, he’s a big deal among economists, especially liberal establishment economists sympathetic to the Democratic Party. And that makes his critique of Biden’s spending proposal all the more potent.Blanchard argues that the hole in the economy created by the pandemic—the output gap, as economists say—is much smaller than $1.9 trillion plus the $900 billion authorized in December. In a blogpost for the Peterson Institute, Blanchard writes that figures from the Congressional Budget Office would imply a shortfall of around $900 billion.But that figure is “undoubtedly an overestimate of the gap that could be filled by an increase in demand.” Because the pandemic has restrained our economy’s ability to produce goods and services, boosting demand through higher government spending will not necessarily be met with more supply—and the jobs and investment that would go with it. Some things we just are not going to do until the pandemic is behind us.What’s more, it’s likely that the spending will have a “multiplier effect,” meaning that for every dollar of government spending more than a dollar of demand will be generated in the economy. While conceding that it is hard to estimate exactly what the multiplier will be, he says that it is likely to be enough that the excess demand generated by the $2.4 trillion of spending will be high. And, Blanchard notes, it is likely that as the economy reopens much of the unusually high household savings that have accumulated during the pandemic will be spent.That extra demand would likely cause prices to rise. In his recent press conference, Fed chairman Jerome Powell agreed that prices would rise but argued that this would not lead to sustained inflation. Blanchard is not so sure. He warns that excess demand would push unemployment to ultralow levels and that, in turn, could lead inflation expectations to change—and that that change in expectations would trigger inflation to rise.Blanchard:A relevant comparison here is what happened in the 1960s, shown in the figure below. From 1961 to 1967, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations ran the economy above potential, leading to a steady decrease in the unemployment rate down to less than 4 percent. Inflation increased but not very much, from 1 percent to just below 3 percent, suggesting to many a permanent trade-off between inflation and unemployment. In 1967, however, inflation expectations started adjusting, and by 1969, inflation had increased to close to 6 percent and was then seen as a major issue. Fiscal and monetary policies tightened, leading to a recession from the end of 1969 to the end of 1970.That, in turn, would likely trigger a reaction by the Federal Reserve, raising interest rates. Alternatively, if the Fed did not react, inflation would continue to soar and much of the central bank’s credibility when it comes to price stability would erode.“If inflation were to take off, there would be two scenarios: one in which the Fed would let inflation increase, perhaps substantially, and another—more likely—in which the Fed would tighten monetary policy, perhaps again substantially,” Blanchard writes.  EconomyPoliticscoronavirusinflationOlivier Blanchardpandemicstimulus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
368,"Democrat women strongly oppose the corporate skilled-labor importation policies that are cheered on by the majority of Democrat men, according to a poll by Rasmussen Reports.The 21-point poll gap creates a hidden split within the pro-amnesty Democrat Party that can help GOP politicians who want to win over Democrat college voters with a platform of pro-American pocketbook policies.The polling gap also revealed another vulnerability in President Joe Biden’s unpopular amnesty, which includes several provisions that would allow corporations to import an unlimited number of foreign graduates for the careers needed by American graduates and their adult children.An outright majority of Democrat men say Congress should let companies import skilled foreign workers instead of hiring and training Americans, according to the January 31-February 4 poll of 1,250 likely voters by Rasmussen Reports. The detailed data on Democrat men and women were provided by Rasmussen at Breitbart’s request.The poll asked, “Should Congress increase the number of foreign workers taking higher-skill U.S. jobs, or does the country already have enough talented people to train and recruit for most of those jobs?”Fifty-six percent of Democrat men — but just 35 percent of Democrat women — approved the corporate inflow.Thirty-five percent of Democrat men — and 46 percent of Democrat women — opposed the inflow, and 19 percent of women declared they were “not sure.”“There’s a reason for that opposition,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers, adding:In 1988, the percentage of women going into tech was increasing. Since the 1990s, it has been decreasing [because H-1B visa workers have replaced at least one million Americans, especially American women] … Women have already been pushed out of tech, they don’t stand a chance with a boss that is here from South Asia on a work permit, and their chance of getting ahead are zero.Overall, the corporate inflow of skilled college graduates was opposed by 61 percent of likely voters, including almost 80 percent of Republicans and roughly 65 percent of people who declined to associate themselves with either party.Source: Rasmussen ReportsThe poll’s crosstabs also showed the view of conservative, “moderate,” and liberal likely voters.Liberal men split 54 percent to 39 percent in support of the corporate inflow, while liberal women split 39 percent to 40 percent against the inflow. Twenty-one percent said they were “not sure.” That is a 15 percent sex gap with liberals.Moderate men split 35 percent for the inflow, 53 percent against, while moderate women split 19 percent for the inflow, 69 percent against.The numbers show how Democrat men have embraced extreme pro-corporate labor policies — long after GOP voters rejected President George W. Bush’s “Any Willing Worker” labor policy.The poll also asked about attitudes towards corporate hiring of foreign workers for “construction, manufacturing, hospitality, and other service work.”That question showed Democrat men somewhat closer to the mainstream.The 1,250 respondents overwhelmingly opposed the unskilled inflow by 66 percent to 18 percent.Democrat men opposed the inflow 59 percent to 29 percent, while Democratic women opposed the unskilled inflow by 54 percent to 23 percent. Twenty-two percent said they were “not sure.”For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and to the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, nonracist, class-based, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950’s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.Biden's amnesty bill dramatically raises the $$ incentive for Fortune 500 CEOs to NOT hire American graduates.

369,"More than one million migrants will try to push through the southern border this year, warns a former senior official in former President Barack Obama’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The 78,000 arrivals in January were “nearly double the figure for the same month last year and the highest for January in a decade,” Juliette Kayyem wrote in a January 18 article for the Atlantic. “If the current pattern holds, the U.S. is on track for more than 1 million encounters in 2021.”One million migrants adds up to roughly one migrant for every four Americans who turn 18 this year.Kayyem’s warning, however, is not about the impact on many millions of Americans whose wages and neighborhoods face damage from the government-delivered flow of workers, buyers, and renters to the U.S. consumer economy. “People who are fleeing persecution and violence deserve refuge,” she insists as senior lecturer of the homeland security program at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.Instead, her concern seems to be that the flood of migrants will prompt American voters to step in and reassert control of the border which has now been delegated to Biden’s team of ethnic advocacy groups, open-borders progressives, and corporate allies.That intervention would be bad for Harvard because it would likely derail Biden’s amnesty bill — a bill includes a massive giveaway to the elite university sector.The Biden bill, if passed, would effectively allow Harvard and other universities to recruit fee-paying foreign students by offering an unlimited number of work permits — complete with a 15-year “path to citizenship.” In effect, the bill allows the universities to train fee-paying foreigners to take the careers the universities’ American graduates need.
Kayyem cautiously tries to blame the flood on the progressive wing of the Democrats. She wrote:Many Democratic candidates during the 2020 presidential-primary season supported decriminalization of unlawful border crossings, and activists and officials on the party’s progressive flank support the outright abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Both positions, however, are unpopular among an American public.The Democrats’ support for the migrant flood is very unpopular across a wide range of American society.Yet Kayyem offers no plan to reduce the approaching migrant flood that threatens the giveaway to Harvard and the rest of the Ivy League. Instead, she pleads from Boston, saying “for the moment, the United States’ humanitarian interest lies not just in showing kindness to those who reach the border, but also in stemming the flow of people who undertake the journey in the first place.”“Biden will have more maneuvering room, both operationally and politically, if he succeeds in signaling to migrants that they should not travel to the border immediately — and that an easing of Trump’s policies is not the same as an unconditional welcome,” she concludes.Biden's amnesty bill dramatically raises the $$ incentive for Fortune 500 CEOs to NOT hire American graduates.

370,"President Joe Biden’s draft amnesty bill includes at least three legal changes that pressure and reward CEOs for importing foreign workers to take the white-collar careers needed by U.S. graduates, including the millions of young graduates who voted for Biden.The college graduate language in Joe Biden’s top-priority “U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021,” bill “is going to force a debate on every college campus and focus the attention of American students about how they’re being pushed out of the job market,” said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers. He continued:This is going to create a backlash on the college campuses. No level of woke ideology is going to suppress the fact that students are going to wake up very quickly to the fact that they have put an awful lot of money into getting a degree, only to be pushed out of the workforce [by Democrats].The debate will also supercharge the growing revolt by American professionals who have seen their jobs, careers, and wealth transferred to foreign contract workers throughout the Fortune 500. Those professionals demand their right to a national labor market as they helped block the S.386 outsourcing bill in 2020 that was pushed by Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT).The draft of the bill was released on January 20, and White House officials confirmed the top three Fortune 500 giveaways in a February 17 press conference.The first of the changes in the amnesty would provide green cards to an unlimited inflow of foreign people who pay tuition to get technology-related PhDs from eager U.S. universities.The second change would allow companies to provide an unlimited number of green cards to an unlimited number of non-immigrant contract workers in exchange for ten years of lower-wage work.A third rule would allow employers to provide more than 140,000 green cards to non-immigrant contract workers via the existing Employment-Based Immigration process. The larger allocation would be more than double the current award to 75,000 workers per year. The number would allow CEOs to pay all of their imported H-1B and L-1 visa workers with green cards — and leave plenty left over to attract more foreign nurses, therapists, and doctors to the jobs needed by Americans.The knock-on effects will be far larger.The CEOs’ current ability to dangle roughly 75,000 green cards a year attracts roughly one million foreign graduates into a wide variety of gig-worker jobs throughout the United States. They take the gig-work jobs — which are mostly lower-paid, subcontract, mid-skill, drudgework — because they are competing against each other to get their CEOs to provide them with one of the 75,000 green cards allocated each year to employees.That million-worker population includes roughly 600,000 foreign white-collar workers who are stuck in their jobs while waiting for their CEOs to deliver the approved green cards.Biden’s amnesty bill would allow CEOs to dangle not just 75,000 cards each year — but dangle millions of green cards to millions of white-collar workers around the world.Crucially, there is no limit on the number of foreigners who can get work permits for U.S. jobs — they just have to have enough cash to enroll at a third-rate U.S. college to get work permits via the tax-favored, low-wage, unsupervised Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and Optional Practical Training (OPT) programs. Under Biden’s bill, CEOs will be able to hire foreign graduates in place of Americans with a promise of a green card after ten years of hopscotching from temporary visa to short-term work permit, and back again, in the United States or overseas.The rational, predictable result will be a massive inflow of foreign graduates into U.S.  jobs.This huge inflow will damage docile American college graduates, just as the massive inflow of blue-collar migrants smashed up the blue-collar working class in California. Their salaries will stall or decline, their status as professionals will be commoditized, their housing costs and commutes will rise, and their children will face tougher competition for slots at good schools and universities.Already, federal data shows that salaries for college graduates dipped two percent from 2016 to 2019, even as blue-collar wages surged amid Trump’s crackdown on blue-collar migration.The white-collar giveaway to the Fortune 500 CEOs is a central part of Biden’s plan, not a discardable flourish.It is central to the plan because the Fortune 500 companies — especially the Silicon Valley companies — rallied to the Biden campaign to get those benefits. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, for example, played a central role in Biden’s election, and his FWD.us advocacy group has been pushing hard for these white-collar workers.It is also central because progressives need the CEOs and their lobbyists to pressure the GOP into accepting the amnesty that will push more Republicans out of office. The swap was described on January 21 by Biden’s chief amnesty advocate in the Senate, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ):We need the high-tech community — who will benefit from the reforms we are proposing — to be advocates of the overall reform movement. We need those who need the H-1B and [H]-2B visas in the business community to be advocates of overall reform. What we cannot have is only being an advocate for the simple niche that takes care of your economic issue, but doesn’t resolve the overall question of the 11 million.When we join together — those and so much more — we can achieve the [amnesty] goal because then those senators and those members of the House who represent large agricultural interests in their districts and state, those who represent high-tech interests in their state, those who represent some of the [H-2B] critical workers — whether it be in the seafood industry in the meatpacking industry or whatnot — who need that work …  so that people understand that this is something worthy of putting their [political] capital [on].So far, the establishment press has not publicized Biden’s promised flood of foreign white-collar workers. “There is nothing remotely radical in what he wants to do,” said an oblivious column by E.J. Dionne in Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post newspaper. An editorial by the newspaper’s editorial board simply ignores the white-collar issue.But Biden’s push to flood the market for college jobs can shift politics, said Lynn.The push will force U.S. graduates to recognize their common interests with the many blue-collar Americans who backed President Donald Trump’s populist immigration reduction platform, he said. If Republicans spotlight the danger, they can win a critical share of swing-voting graduates in the 2022 and 2024 elections, Lynn said.Trump missed this opportunity in 2020 by ignoring the economic impact of migration on swing-voting Americans. Instead, he talked about low priority concerns, such as migrant crime, welfare spending, and border integrity.But the status, health, and income of younger college graduates are shrinking. For example, a 2017 report in the New York Times declared:Unemployment rates for STEM majors may be low, but not all of those with undergraduate degrees end up in their field of study — only 13 percent in life sciences and 17 percent in physical sciences, according to a 2013 National Science Foundation survey. Computer science is the only STEM field where more than half of graduates are employed in their field.Source: New York TimesThe massive career loss is indicated by federal income reports. “Families without a high school diploma saw a 9 percent increase in their median income, while families with a college degree saw a 2 percent decrease,” said a September 2020 report by the Federal Reserve banking system.A plurality of Dem & liberal voters favor letting Fortune 500 CEOs import contract workers for the jobs needed by US college grads. Everyone else opposes the outsourcing.Swing voters oppose it by 66% to 22%.GOP voters oppose it by 78% to 14% #H1B #OPThttps://t.co/2bLOfsw3bG— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 11, 2021 The January 20 draft of Biden’s bill showed multiple ways for Fortune 500 companies to increase their white-collar hiring from overseas. A copy of the updated bill is expected to be released on February 18.In. Sec. 3102 (a), the bill doubles the award of green cards in the Employment-Based system by exempting spouses and children. This means companies can get 140,000 green cards each year to dangle in front of foreign graduates.In Sec. 3401(a), the bill awards green cards to any foreign graduate who gets science and technology PhDs from American universities. Roughly 7,000 foreigners get PhDs each year, but if universities can sell tickets to citizenship, then many will likely develop new PhDs that allow foreigners to get PhDs after several years of work, study, and tuition. The number can be very large — roughly 136,000 foreign graduates were working in PhDs at American universities in 2019, according to the 2020 version of Open Doors, a government-backed report. This provision is a huge incentive for employers to maintain or adopt the business model of replacing US workers with visa workers at lower pay, and having the ability to promise the visa workers a green card in 10 years, putting a firm end date on the period of cheap indentured labor that the worker has to endure. The bill also eliminates the pro-diversity country caps, which have helped to cause a huge backlog of Indian graduates who are working in U.S. jobs to get green cards. In Sec. 3403, the bill adds 30,000 extra green cards per year for people without college degrees — such as laboratory workers, therapists, nurses, farmworkers, and dairy workers. 300,000 Extra Green Cards In Sec. 3101(b), the bill also adds an estimated 300,000 H-1Bs under the claim that the visas were offered but not used from 19992 to 2020. Over a ten-year period, the two measures would add another 600,000 foreign graduates to the U.S. labor market — many of whom would get green cards to stay permanently.GOP senators have not targeted this corporate outsourcing of middle-class jobs to foreign graduates, despite repeated efforts by former Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL). However, GOP legislators are putting more attention on the issue, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), and even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT).Establishment reporters have not covered the huge economic impact of migration on white-collar Americans, despite extensive coverage by mainstream publications.The inflow of India's visa-workers creates a huge 'bonded labor' workforce that empowers Fortune 500 CEOs & shrivels professionalism, say US/India tech-professionals.

371,"Keith Gill, one of the most influential voices in the online community of GameStop bulls, is set to tell Congress that he thinks the market is still undervaluing shares of the game-seller.Gill, better known by his online handles Roaring Kitty and DeepF__ingValue, is scheduled to testify at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Thursday.“GameStop’s stock price may have gotten a bit ahead of itself last month, but I’m as bullish as I’ve ever been on a potential turnaround,” Gill says in his prepared testimony. “In short, I like the stock.”Gill will testify that he invested in the company because he believed the market had overrated the chances that the company would go bankrupt and underrated its prospects for a turnaround.“I believed the company was dramatically undervalued by the market. The prevailing analysis about GameStop’s impending doom was simply wrong,” he is set to testify.Gill probably will not wear the headband he’s been known to wear on his Roaring Kitty YouTube channel. And he will not be allowed to eat chicken tenders or dip them in prosecco. But apart from that, his testimony will strongly resemble his Youtube content. That is, it is mostly focused on why he thinks GameStop is such a great investment opportunity.From Gill’s testimony:GameStop, the only major retailer dedicated to gaming, has over 60 million members in its loyalty program and continues to maintain a sizable market share within the gaming industry. Its legacy business, comprised primarily of selling physical video games and related equipment within their stores, was likely to generate meaningful cash flow following the release of new gaming consoles in late 2020. I grew up playing videogames and shopping at GameStop, and I’m looking forward to buying a new console at GameStop. I knew the company had an opportunity to reinvigorate this business by improving customer service for gamers, upgrading its online presence, and offering complementary product lines such as PC gaming and accessories.Second, I believed – and I continue to believe – that GameStop has the potential to reinvent itself as the ultimate destination for gamers within the thriving $200 billion gaming industry. The new console cycle provides GameStop a unique opportunity to pivot from a traditionally brickand-mortar mindset toward a technology-driven business that excels in gaming products, experiences and services. By embracing the digital economy, GameStop can pursue new revenues streams including larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, online trade-ins, streaming services, and Esports.In the testimony, Gill claims he took to social media to talk about his investment ideas not to influence the price of the stock but in hopes of helping others and being challenged by other finding problems with his ideas.“I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel,” Gill says in the testimony. “Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis – my focus was on the fundamentals of the business.”Gill also shares some personal information:Ultimately my GameStop investment was a success. But the thing is, I felt that way in December far before the peak, when the stock was at $20 a share. I was so happy to visit my family in Brockton for the holidays and give them the great news – we were millionaires. That money will go such a long way for my family. We had an incredibly difficult 2020. In addition to dealing with COVID, we lost my sister Sara unexpectedly in June. It brought me tremendous joy to share good news with my family for a change. I am grateful to be able to give back to my community and to support my family, most of all my wife Caroline who has stuck with me through very tough times.“As for what happened in January, others will have to explain it,” his testimony says.Gill’s latest Reddit post indicated he made about $7.5 million on his GameStop investment. Shares of GameStop were trading around $45 on Wednesday closed at $45.94 on Wednesday, far below the $483 high it hit weeks ago but around 170 percent higher than its level at the start of 2020.A class-action lawsuit against Gill was filed on Tuesday alleging that he had engaged in securities fraud in touting the stock. The lawsuit claims that Gill was a licensed professional investor posing as an amateur. EconomyGameStopKeith GillStocks.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

376,"New weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rose by 13,000 to 861,000 in the week that ended February 13, the Department of Labor said Thursday.Economists had expected claims to fall to 768,00 from the 793,000 initially reported for the prior week. The previous week’s figure was revised up by 55,000 to 848,000.Jobless claims can be volatile week to week so economists like to look at the four-week average. This fell to 833,250, 3,500 below the prior week’s average.Jobless claims—which are a proxy for layoffs—remain at extremely high levels. Prior to the pandemic, the highest level of claims was 695,000 hit in October of 1982. In March of 2009, at the depths of the financial crisis recession, jobless claims peaked at 665,000.Even when the economy is creating a lot of demand for workers, many businesses will shed employees as they adjust to market conditions. But in a high-pressure labor market, those employees quickly find jobs and many never show up on the employment rolls. What appears to be happening now is that many workers who lose their jobs cannot quickly find replacement work and are forced to apply for benefits.Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27, more than ten times the previous record. Through spring and early summer, each subsequent week had seen claims decline. But in late July, the labor market appeared to stall and claims hovered around one million throughout August, a level so high it was never recorded before the pandemic struck. Claims moved down again in September and had made slow, if steady, progress until the election.Continuing claims, which get reported with a week’s lag, fell by 64,000 to 4,494,000.There are two new programs offering unemployment benefits to people previously ineligible, such as self-employed workers or small business owners. The total number of continued weeks claimed for benefits in all programs for the week ending January 30 was 18,340,161, a decrease of 1,325,567 from the previous week. Economyjobless claimsunemployment.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
377,"Things are looking up for the construction industry.Homebuilder confidence rose one point to a score of 84 in February, the National Association of Home Builders said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by Econoday had predicted the measure to remain flat with January’s 83.Anything above 50 is considered positive sentiment.A year ago the index was at 74. It dropped during the initial lockdowns after the pandemic struck but has soared higher as demand for single family homes has skyrocketed.
Buyers are seeking out a respite from increasingly violent and deadly cities, where murders and shootings have exploded higher. Gun murders were up 31 percent in the United States in 2020. New York City, for example, finished 2020 with a 14-year high in shootings and a 40 percent increase in murders from the year before. This summer, New York and other cities were beset by riots, looting, and left-wing mobs demanding the defunding of police departments.Schools and workplaces have also been shut down so that family members are working and learning from home. This puts a premium on space, feeding into demand for larger houses. Many people who once commuted five days a week expect to work only part-time from the office once the virus is contained.As well, many of the amenities—museums, theaters, restaurants, nightlife, sports—that made living in city centers attractive have been closed or highly restricted for nearly a year. Very low mortgage rates have helped keep homes affordable despite rising prices.Extremely low levels of existing homes for sale is pushing demand into the market for new homes, which is around 12 percent of the overall housing market.The component of the index that tracks traffic of prospective buyers increased four points to 72. The index of expectations for future sales over the next six months fell by three points to 80, while the current sales activity metric held steady.Builder confidence in the Northeast saw a huge jump from 68 in January to 89 in February.Strong buyer demand helped offset supply chain challenges and a surge in lumber prices, the trade group said.“Demand conditions remain solid due to demographics, low mortgage rates and the suburban shift to lower cost markets, but we expect to see some cooling in growth rates for residential construction in 2021 due to cost factors, supply chain issues and regulatory risks,” said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. “Some builders are at capacity and may not be able to expand production due to these headwinds.”EconomyFlight from the CitiesHomebuildershousingReal Estate.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

381,"San Francisco has become a “desolate” city over the past year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced people to work from home — and companies learned to embrace it.A few years ago, as Breitbart News reported in 2016, San Francisco was so crowded with workers, and so expensive to live in, that people would commute from hours away each day to reach the city.Now, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, the city is empty — and may struggle to regain its former bustle:Once-crammed streets are desolate, with only the whoosh of automobile traffic stirring the air. Muni buses and BART trains run nearly empty. Storefronts are boarded up or vacant, from the 172-year-old Tadich Grill to the shells of trendy juice shops and fitness clubs. Almost all offices have been closed for 11 months, with no return date set. The patter of rain in recent days has made the mood even bleaker.…The prospect of workers returning soon — after shelter-in-place lifts, after vaccines roll out, after schools reopen — has receded, and nonessential workers remain banned from offices. Remote work, made necessary by the health crisis, is becoming a permanent policy at many of the city’s biggest employers. Once tech’s rising capital, downtown San Francisco may never return to its frenetic, bustling state.…Any reduction in workers will have seismic effects on the local economy. Citywide sales taxes, a measure of business health, dropped 43% in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year. The biggest drops were in downtown, with losses over 70% and restaurants and hotels bearing the brunt of declines.The city still enjoys a budget surplus. Still, with schools failing to reopen, tourism at a standstill, and homelessness and street crime still plaguing the city, San Francisco faces a long climb back.Joel B.

383,"Apple CEO Tim Cook was the “architect” of the multinational corporation’s plan to outsource most of its production to China, ushering what Bloomberg Businessweek calls an “era of outsourced manufacturing and made-to-order products.”A profile published in Bloomberg Businessweek details Cook’s slick political maneuvering and an outsourcing scheme that has driven Apple’s market value to $2.3 trillion while gutting its U.S. manufacturing base — and encouraging others to do so — for cheap labor in China, India, and Vietnam.Bloomberg Businessweek reports:As everyone at the dinner well knew, the idea of mass-producing an iPhone, or any advanced consumer electronics, in a domestic factory was an exceptionally tall order. The big Asian contract manufacturers, especially Apple Inc.’s main partner, Foxconn, had built city-size factories in China with armies of hundreds of thousands of skilled laborers. None of that scale existed in the U.S. Chinese factory employees generally worked much longer hours, for a fraction of what even the lowest-paid American workers make. “I’m not sure, short of dictatorial practices, that you could ever make that work,” says John Riccitiello, another Silicon Valley executive who witnessed the exchange between Cook and Biden. [Emphasis added]Biden’s question put Cook, who’d become Apple’s CEO the previous August, in an awkward position. He was the architect of the strategy to outsource Apple’s production to China, a trend of increasing concern for the Obama administration. But Cook was also, as it turned out, extremely effective at deflecting political pressure. He was certainly more diplomatic than his old boss. Obama once asked [Steve] Jobs the same question, and Jobs’s characteristically blunt reply landed on the front page of the New York Times: “Those jobs aren’t coming back.” Cook, though, was smooth and noncombative — so much so, in fact, that Riccitiello can’t recall exactly what he said to Biden. By the end of that year, Cook announced a small yet politically significant shift. Apple, he said, would start making some Macs in the U.S. [Emphasis added]And then, Apple’s reliance on China only grew. You might think its ever-tighter embrace with the country would have put Cook in a worse political position after Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 based on a campaign marked by anti-China rhetoric, threats of a trade war, and promises to bring jobs lost to Shenzhen back to American shores — not to mention challenges of the coronavirus pandemic and rising antitrust fervor during his term in office. Strangely, though, Apple thrived under Trump. In August 2018, the company’s market value reached $1 trillion; 24 months later, even as Trump railed on the campaign trail that “these stupid supply chains” in China should move home, it surpassed $2 trillion. [Emphasis added]Apple’s manufacturing was not always based overseas. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Apple employed thousands of Americans at manufacturing plants in Texas, Colorado, and California. By the mid-1990s, though, Apple started moving its U.S. production to plants in Singapore and Ireland.In 2004, Apple closed its last U.S. manufacturing plant, laying off 235 American workers. Today, most of Apple’s supply chain is based in China and other foreign countries. A 2017 report from Yahoo Finance found that Apple supports about 4.8 million jobs in China and its Chinese supply chain, alone, has more than a million workers.Cook, as Bloomberg Businessweek notes, sped up the company’s outsourcing to China by shifting its laptop and webcam production there.Even amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Cook has ensured Apple remains fully operational in China, according to Bloomberg Businessweek by chartering private flights to and from the country so that employees could manage production.Already, the Biden administration is avoiding criticism of multinational corporations like Apple which have continued doing business in China despite a record of human rights abuses and subpar labor standards.Last week, when Breitbart News’ Charlie Spiering asked if President Joe Biden supported American companies speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party as they continue to do business in China, White House press secretary Jen Psaki dodged the question.“The president’s been outspoken, as he was, in his conversation with the president of China about American values,” Psaki said.“He’s the president of the United States; he’s conveying what he feels our values are,” Psaki continued. “And he conveys that to anyone he has conversations with whether it’s publicly or privately to companies or to leaders of other countries.”Last year, Apple successfully avoided U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports for some of its products thanks to Cook’s close working relationship with the Trump administration. In March 2020, the administration gave a tariff waiver for Apple Watch, ensuring that the company avoided a 7.5 percent duty while importing its smartwatches from China to the U.S. market.In December 2019, Apple avoided tariffs on its iPhones that it makes in China after the Trump administration announced the first phase of a trade deal.While hundreds of thousands of American small and medium-sized businesses have been forced to permanently close as a result of the coronavirus crisis, multinational corporations like Apple have netted record profits with their increasing market power and monopolies over various industries.Apple, between October and December 2020, reported more than $111 billion in revenue, an increase of more than 20 percent compared to the same time last year.Around the same time, amid yet another surge in Covid-19 cases and continued economic uncertainty, the company reported revenue of $111 billion for the previous quarter, a record. Meanwhile, as tens of millions of Americans have been laid off from their jobs, Cook’s annual salary increased by nearly 30 percent in 2020 to $14.8 million.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

387,"President Biden claims that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour will force employers to pay a living wage to workers, but the weight of economic studies say that it would have an adverse effect on employment.Biden’s plan, which is making its way through Capitol Hill now as part of the covid relief package, would more than double minimum wage. It would also cost jobs, particularly for young workers and less-educated workers.Many supporters of hiking the minimum claim, without evidence, that the economic studies have shown that a higher wage will not reduce employment or that the studies are split evenly on the question.A new review of the economic literature published in academic journals over the past few decades indicates that this is wrong. In fact, there is a clear preponderance of negative effects on employment, the study finds.David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine’s Department of Economics and his former student Peter Shirley analyzed the core conclusions from each study published on the topic of the minimum wage over the last three decades. They also contacted the authors of the studies to confirm their view of the findings.
They found that the literature indicates “minimum wages reduce low-skilled employment. It is incumbent on anyone arguing that research supports the opposite conclusion to explain why most of the studies are wrong.”The study was published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.The CBO forecast that the Biden proposal would cost 1.4 million jobs.

392,"The number of migrants arriving at President Joe Biden’s southern border hit a ten-year record for January, but his agency officials are blaming crime and disease for the growing migration.The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency “has faced a growing number of individuals attempting to cross the southwest border, averaging about 3,000 arrests per day in January 2021,” said a 7:00 pm press statement by the agency, which added:CBP believes this increase is caused by several factors, including underlying crime and instability in migrants’ home countries, which have been exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inaccurate perceptions of shifts in immigration and border security policies.However, establishment media outlets are reporting that many migrants — and their U.S. supporters — say they are heading north to accept Biden’s promise of jobs and free health care — as well as and life-changing citizenship for migrants who persuade government officials they were in the United States before January 1.The Washington Post reported February 3:A Central American official who closely monitors migration dynamics said smuggling guides have intensified their marketing efforts in Guatemala’s destitute rural highlands in recent weeks, recruiting customers by telling them the Biden administration is taking a softer enforcement approach.“They’re saying Biden has given the green light,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters.Border officials registered 78,000 people in January, according to an agency webpage, which did not say how many were flown back to their home countries or were released into the United States.

The Border Patrol generally releases those families into the country, though reports have emerged of immigrant parents and U.S.-born children being expelled.Buried in the CBP’s statement on the apprehension numbers, CBP reported:Under the label of “adjusting its operations,” the agency is completing a large facility to process teenage and child migrants for delivery to relatives in the United States, and it is releasing many mothers and children into the United States without testing for coronavirus.In a February 3 report for the Center for Immigration Studies, Todd Bensman reported:One Border Patrol agent in the area told CIS that the migrants are now too numerous for local systems to process, just like the catch-and-release circumstances that powered the 2019 crisis.“We are releasing hundreds from many different countries of origin because we simply don’t have enough room to hold them all,” the Border Patrol agent told the Center for Immigration Studies. “They are being released under what is called an O.R. which means ‘Own Recognizance’ – basically, a promise to arrive for their immigration hearing at some future date. We can’t hold them because they are crossing all day long in groups of 20 to 40, men, women, children.”Joe Biden's deputies have demolished the Guatemalan asylum deal as they try to expand migration into Americans' labor market.

393,"President Joe Biden has dropped the national border emergency declaration that President Donald Trump established in 2019 to help cut migration and redirect federal funds for the border wall.“I have determined that the declaration of a national emergency at our southern border was unwarranted,” Biden said in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).The letter does not say if Biden will continue to spend several hundred million dollars of unspent border wall funding appropriated in 2020 and 2019 for border-wall projects.Pro-migration advocates cheered Biden’s move, saying it may help undermine Trump’s 2020 decision to establish Title 42 health rules to block southern migrants during the coronavirus epidemic.“OMG! President Biden has now TERMINATED the national emergency declaration on the southern border, clearing the way for the repeal of CDC Title 42 expulsion order,” said a tweet from immigration lawyer Nicolette Glazier:OMG! President Biden has now TERMINATED the national emergency decl on the southern border, clearing the way for the repeal of CDC Title 42 expulsion order.#NoBan tweeps, PP10014 must be next! https://t.co/uPnYY0471d— Nicolette Glazer (@NicoletteGlazer) February 11, 2021Some — but not all — GOP legislators are warning Biden against removing the Title 42 barrier. Fifty GOP legislators signed a February 9 letter to Biden warning:Notably, the Trump administration’s policy to use 42 U.S. Code § 265 is perhaps now the only policy ensuring the southern border is not immediately rushed. Unfortunately, however, just last week, you signed another Executive Order threatening the longevity of this crucial policy. If title 42 is indeed rescinded, the daily illegal flow will become catastrophic overnight.Biden had already directed his deputies to stop constructing the border wall using money gathered under Trump’s national emergency. The funds, mostly from the Pentagon, helped build 450 miles of the border wall.However, Biden’s letter is unclear about whether he will try to cancel unspent border wall money that Congress duly appropriated in 2019 and 2020.  The letter says:I have also announced that it shall be the policy of my Administration that no more American taxpayer dollars be diverted to construct a border wall, and that I am directing a careful review of all resources appropriated or redirected to that end.I hereby report to the Congress that the national emergency declared by Proclamation 9844 …  is terminated and that the authorities invoked in that proclamation will no longer be used to construct a wall at the southern border.Biden’s removal of the emergency declaration will help his deputies as they try to raise migration flows into Americans’ jobs, housing, and schools.Officials are trying to boost the inflow of wage-cutting migration — while also avoiding a 2022 pushback by swing-voting, suburban voters. This zig zag policy requires the agency to raise the influx of migrants while also fending off border-opening demands from their impatient open-borders supporters.Joe Biden's deputies blame crime & poverty for the migrant wave at his border — even as many migrants say they rationally decided to take Biden's offers of jobs, asylum, & healthcare.

394,"LONDON (AP) – The British economy suffered its biggest decline in more than 300 years in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic closed shops and restaurants, devastated the travel industry and curtailed manufacturing.The economy shrank 9.9% last year, more than twice the figure for 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. The drop is the largest since 1709, when a cold spell known as the Great Frost devastated what was then a largely agricultural economy.The data comes as Britain´s economy remains shackled by restrictions designed to combat COVID-19. A rebound in growth during the fourth quarter has been stifled by England´s third lockdown, which has closed schools, restaurants and non-essential shops since mid-December. Tough restrictions also remain in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.“Today´s figures show that the economy has experienced a serious shock as a result of the pandemic, which has been felt by countries around the world,” the U.K.´s top treasury official, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said in a statement. “While there are some positive signs of the economy´s resilience over the winter, we know that the current lockdown continues to have a significant impact on many people and businesses.”Sunak said he would announce new plans to protect jobs and bolster the economy when he delivers his annual budget statement to the House of Commons on March 3.COVID-19 has hit Britain´s economy harder than most other industrialized democracies. French GDP shrank 8.3% last year, Germany 5% and the U.S. 3.5%.The GDP figures show the breadth of the pandemic´s economic impact in Britain.The service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the U.K. economy, shrank 8.9% last year, with output from accommodation, food and beverage businesses down more than 55% from February levels. Manufacturing fell 8.6% and construction 12.5%.In hopes of relaxing the restrictions that have devastated the economy, the U.K. has moved to rapidly vaccinate its most vulnerable residents. More than 13.5 million people, or about 20% of the population, had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by Wednesday.Andy Haldane, chief economist for the Bank of England, said the vaccination drive is helping Britain turn a corner in its battle against the virus. Lifting COVID-19 restrictions is likely to unleash a wave of spending by consumers and businesses that will trigger a rapid recovery later this year, he said.“A decisive corner is about to be turned for the economy, too, with enormous amounts of pent-up financial energy waiting to be released, like a coiled spring,” Haldane wrote in the Daily Mail.But that optimism comes against the backdrop of Europe´s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 115,000 deaths recorded so far.“These figures confirm that not only has the U.K. had the worst death toll in Europe, we´re experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy,” said Anneliese Dodds, the opposition Labour Party´s spokesperson on economic issues. “Businesses can´t wait any longer. The Chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand-in-hand with health restrictions.”EconomyLondon / EuropeBank of EnglandcoronavirusRishi SunakUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
395,"New claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week to 793,000, a decline of 19,000 from the prior week’s upwardly revised figure.Claims can be volatile week to week and are subject to large revisions. Last week’s figure was revised up from 779,000 to 812,000. So although this week’s release indicates a drop in claims, it is actually higher than the figure released a week prior.Economists had forecast claims falling to 760,000.Jobless claims—which are a proxy for layoffs—remain at extremely high levels. Prior to the pandemic, the highest level of claims was 695,000 hit in October of 1982. In March of 2009, at the depths of the financial crisis recession, jobless claims peaked at 665,000.Even when the economy is creating a lot of demand for workers, many businesses will shed employees as they adjust to market conditions. But in a high-pressure labor market, those employees quickly find jobs and many never show up on the employment rolls. What appears to be happening now is that many workers who lose their jobs cannot quickly find replacement work and are forced to apply for benefits.Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27, more than ten times the previous record. Through spring and early summer, each subsequent week had seen claims decline. But in late July, the labor market appeared to stall and claims hovered around one million throughout August, a level so high it was never recorded before the pandemic struck. Claims moved down again in September and had made slow, if steady, progress until the election.The elevation of Joe Biden to the presidency and the Senate control of the Senate passing to Democrats may be discouraging hiring. Biden has promised to make raising taxes on businesses a top priority for his administration, which will leave businesses with fewer funds for expanding payrolls or raising wages. As well, many businesses expect a flood of new regulations from the Biden administration, which can also weigh on the labor market. Biden has spent much of the first few weeks of his presidency signing a flurry of executive orders that purport to reverse pro-business policies put in place by his predecessor.New restrictions on businesses aimed at stemming the resurgence of coronavirus are likely contributing to layoffs now. Some states and cities have imposed new curfews and discouraged people from leaving home for non-essential reasons. Businesses faced with this suppressed demand will likely be forced to cut their payrolls to reflect lower sales.There are contrapuntal signs of economic strength. The housing market is booming, pushing up construction spending and homebuilding, and increasing the household wealth of homeowners. Surveys by the Institute for Supply Management of business leaders indicated more growth than expected in both the services and manufacturing sides of the economy.Economyunemployment.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
396,"U.S. home prices are rising at an accelerating pace all over the country, data released Thursday by the National Association of Realtors show.The median price of a single-family home climbed 14.9 percent to $315,000 in the fourth quarter.The median sales price for existing homes in each of the 180 metro areas tracked by the NAR rose, the second widespread quarterly gain. This is the first time growth was seen in every metro area in back-t0-back quarters.The housing boom is accelerating all over the country. One hundred and sixty-one metro areas, 88 percent of those tracked, experienced double-digit-percentage price increases, up from 115 metro areas with double-digit gains in the third quarter.The Northeast saw the biggest price gains, with home prices rising 21 percent. Bridgeport in Fairfield County, Connecticut, which has seen an influx of people moving from New York City, saw prices rise 39.2 percent. Prices in New Jersey’s Atlantic City climbed 30 percent.While home sellers have benefited from the fourth quarter price increases, NAR economist Lawrence Yun warned that the large rises in home prices could soon become detrimental to homebuyers.“The average, working family is struggling to contend with home prices that are rising much faster than income,” he said. “This sidelines a consumer from becoming an actual buyer, causing them to miss out on accumulating wealth from homeownership.”The Federal Reserve’s near zero interest rate target and its promise to keep rates low have led to extremely low mortgage rates, contributing to the demand for houses and pushing up prices.The surge in demand for single-family homes caught the real estate professionals and home builders by surprise. Sales plunged in March and April, due to lockdowns and potential buyers staying away for fear of contracting the virus. The initial surge in May and June was mostly seen as arising from pent-up demand. But as the surge has continued into the winter months, it is now increasingly clear that this is a bigger secular change in the housing market.Buyers are seeking out a respite from increasingly violent and deadly cities, where murders and shootings have exploded higher. Gun murders were up 31 percent in the United States in 2020. New York City, for example, finished 2020 with a 14-year high in shootings and a 40 percent increase in murders from the year before. This summer, New York and other cities were beset by riots, looting, and left-wing mobs demanding the defunding of police departments.Schools and workplaces have also been shut down so that family members are working and learning from home. This puts a premium on space, feeding into demand for larger houses. Many people who once commuted five days a week expect to work only part-time from the office once the virus is contained.Surging prices and demand are not luring Americans out of their homes. The number of homes for sale in December was 23 percent below December 2019’s inventory, down to just 1.07 million, the National Association of Realtors said. That is the lowest level in records going back to 1982.EconomyFlight from the CitieshousingReal Estate.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
397,"Robots are replacing unskilled migrants in American farm jobs, but farmers still want skilled migrants to operate the robots, says the president of a major farm advocacy group.“While advances in robotics have replaced some farm jobs, we need skilled employees to manage that equipment,” said Zippy Duvall, the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. In a February 3 post on the groups’ website, he wrote:U.S. agriculture needs a flexible guest-worker program that allows contract and at-will employment options that work for both seasonal and year-round needs on the farm. We also need to make sure wage requirements take into account the economic conditions of the agriculture industry and enable farms to remain viable.The “guest worker” program cited by Duvall refers to the H-2A program. Democrats are signaling they will expand it — if farmers persuade GOP legislators to OK an amnesty to lock in Democratic political and economic dominance for many years.Duvall wants to make a deal, saying:The American Farm Bureau is ready to work with the Administration and Congress to bring these long overdue reforms to our guest worker program to help provide long-term security to our employees, farm businesses and the rural economy.That is a political problem for the many GOP members who represent the farming districts, where the interest of farm employers in cheap labor is deeply contradictory to the interest of many wage-earning voters, as well as myriad local retailers, real estate people, and other professionals who eventually receive a hare of those wages. The tension has helped torpedo prior cheap-labor deals that were pushed by Democrats and some Republicans.“Legislators need to balance the interests within the agricultural sector — the employers’ desire to maximize profits compared to the numerous Americans who are seeking a fair wage,” said Rob Law, the legislative and regulatory director at the Center for Immigration Studies.Guest workers “create an artificial bubble during the growing season, and what is left behind is a ghost town of Americans who have no jobs, no opportunities. And, frankly, no, town.”Big, automated, corporate farms have enough profits to pay their workers, he said, adding:… it’s a permanent financial redistribution away from rural America, into foreign countries across the world by use of guest worker programs ..  they’re choosing the course of least resistance, out of convenience and do not to care about the repercussions to the local community in which these farm companies actually are doing business.But some GOP legislators — such as orchard owner Rep. Dan Newhouse ( R-WA) — have long supported easier access to migrant labor.The H-2A program has grown rapidly over the last several years as farmers say they face a shortage of Americans willing to work in unmechanized and unautomated fruit picking and stoop labor jobs.But alongside the Mexican and Central American stoop labor, farmers are using the program to import skilled machine operators from countries such as South Africa instead of recruiting, training, and paying young Americans.The H-2A program allows the owners of large farms to escape the economic pressure of the United States’ labor market, where CEOs must bargain over wages and conditions with legally equal Americans. Those Americans are free to demand a higher share of profits, quit their contracts, demand benefits such as healthcare, or take time off to care for their children.But the farm managers have far more control over the cheap and compliant H-2A workers — as well as J-1 visa workers who also serve as machine operators.The foreign workers cannot shift employers or demand higher wages. Their families and other personal distractions are thousands of miles away, usually in homelands where U.S. contracts are a godsend from local economic and political pressure. The visa workers do not have to be paid in the off-seasons, and they provide companies with just-in-time and very disposable farm labor.In at least one case, a farm company was alleged to have preferred H-2A workers over Americans and even paid them more than Americans. The Daily Journal reported in 2016 from New Jersey:HOPEWELL – A Cumberland County nursery was ordered to pay more than $143,000 in back wages and penalties following a federal Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division investigation that found it paid foreign workers better than U.S. citizens.The H-2A labor also includes skilled operators for combine harvesters, planter, weeders, sprayers, tractors, trucks — and for the next wave of automated, robotic farming machinery.On January 28, President Joe Biden’s deputies lifted a disease travel ban that barred workers from South Africa — and which would have forced farmers to hire American operators.Hayandforage.com explained the value of the South African machineoperators for large farms:[Mike] Brosnan’s son-in-law, one of his daughters, and his wife work with him on the [South Dakota] farm to grow about 2,500 acres of alfalfa and 5,500 acres of corn, soybeans, and occasionally winter wheat. Each growing season requires extra workers to get the job done.Over the years, the American workers who responded to Brosnan’s annual “Help Wanted” ads repeatedly moved on to new opportunities, leaving him continually searching for help.…“Generally, I don’t receive any applications from American workers,” Brosnan said. “The South African workers we’ve brought over differ from some of employees we’ve had in the past in that they are dependable. They always show up on time and hardly complain about anything. They’re here to earn money, and they know how to hustle. There’s always an exception out there, but most of them have a very good work ethic.”The South Africans are “desperate” for the work, said Manuel Fick, a youth African immigrant who delivers South African labors to American farmers.AgWeb.com reported January 29:Agriculture last year brought in 275,430 H-2A guest workers, of which equipment operators accounted for 15,326 positions. South Africa accounted for roughly 5,000 H-2A workers, the vast majority of which were equipment operators.…“Overall, it’s not a lot of people — 5,000 people — that come over here from South Africa, but those 5,000 cover a lot of acres for farmers,” Tom-Rowland said. “That’s really difficult when farmers are making specific plans for different crops and they don’t have the staffing required for them.”The Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation sent a letter to the state’s congressional delegation as well, stressing the importance of the South African guest workers. The group stated that roughly 800 guest workers from South Africa work on Mississippi farm operations.DTNPF.com reported:Kassi Tom-Rowland, who does human resources for Tom Farms in Leesburg, Indiana, said early Thursday that her family’s farm is planning on four equipment operators to help with the farm, with the first pair of workers set to come in late February. The workers will work the entire cropping season for Tom Farms from planting to harvest. Essentially, the South African H-2A workers make up roughly 25% of the farm’s labor during the crop season.…[Elizabeth] Jack said the H-2A placement service her farm uses had told her as many as 190 farms just in Mississippi had gone through that placement service this year seeking H-2A workers from South Africa to work machinery.Some of the H-2A operators are hired to be migrant workers for the machine-owning contractors that travel from state to state throughout planting and harvest seasons.The labor outsourcing is great for South African workers. Businessinsider.co.za reported February 3 that recruiters are offering visa workers $2,000 a month for U.S jobs: “We are looking for people who have agricultural experience in machines, like combines, tractors, grain carts and also truck drivers,” explains Celia van Heerden of Golden Opportunities International.The farm companies are following the example set by other powerful industry groups who cannot export their work to Asian or Mexican factories.Fortune 500 corporation and Silicon Valley tech firms use the H-1B and OPT programs to import their own workforce. The healthcare sector is importing many of its workers via green cards and the J-1 program. The restaurant sector and construction industry, hotels, and cleaning services legally outsource their hiring to legal subcontractors who hire illegals.The government-delivered labor also offers farmers a temporary escape from the grinding competition in the international food sector. Outside of the United States, new generations of skilled farmers are combining very cheap labor, cheap technology, with international transport and marketing to grab market share from America’s once-dominant farmers.The competition leaves U.S. farmers will less cash as they compete for labor in a nation where frame jobs are derided by the elite urban managers of the cultural industries — and are also stigmatized by their own illegitimate use of illegal foreign labor.The H-2A program is intended to tenure that “this country has what it needs in terms of our vital agricultural infrastructure,” said Joe Edlow, the former acting chief of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Srrvices agency.  “But if these employers are using it in a way to manipulate the program, and to control workers and abuse the program, instead of hiring willing American workers — especially during COVID — well, then that’s not the way that the program was meant to be.” he said  to Breitbart News February 9.Farm employers “have come to rely on them and trust them — and they are admirable people, they do a good job. But that’s not the point. The point is, they are here to do a job and. if that’s no longer the case that they’re needed for that job then, frankly, I question whether an H-2A petition should have even been approved.”This resulting pressure on jobs and wages is pushing many Americans out of careers — and into drugs. The Duluth News Tribune reported in November 2020:A 2017 poll sponsored by the American Farm Bureau Federation and National Farmers Union revealed that 74% of farmers and farm workers say they have been directly affected by the opioid epidemic. Results from the poll also revealed that 3 in 4 farmers said it was easy to access large amounts of opioids without a prescription, and only 1 in 3 rural adults said it would be easy to access addiction treatment.The shocking numbers resulted in the American Farm Bureau Foundation along with the National Farmers Union creating the Farm Town Strong initiative, to help farm families overcome drug addiction with strong farmer-to-farmer support.“We’ve known for some time that opioid addiction was a serious problem in farm country, but numbers like these are heartbreaking,”  Duvall said in 2017. “Opioids have been too easy to come by and too easy to become addicted to.In his February 3 post, Duvall complained about the difficulty of recruiting American:Even with competitive wages and added benefits, there is less interest in farm jobs as folks leave rural areas and are more removed from the farm. Meanwhile the current farm workforce is aging, and farmers are struggling to keep up with filling positions. Margins are slim even in the best seasons on the farm, and farmers can find it hard to stay competitive with other industries and lower-priced agricultural imports.…It’s time we find a solution that provides farmers, our employees and our families the stability we all need to keep America’s farms growing.Duvall did not respond to questions from Breitbart News.“My advice for all politicians,” said Law, “is that you should advocate for the American people because those are the actual voters, and there are more voters than there are donors.”“The agricultural sector is just saying that Americans need not apply — go figure out something else,” said Law.Meanwhile, the U.S. tech sector is developing, testing, and retesting a new generation of labor-saving, productivity-boosting, farm automation th5 reduce the need for stoop labor:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbxYuB9TBbg

399,"The U.S. budget deficit will be wider than previously forecast because of the $900 billion stimulus bill passed in December, the Congrssional Budget Office said Thursday.The CBO forecasts that the federal government will borrow $2.26 trillion this year. That would make it the second-largest budget deficit in history, just behind last year’s. Last year’s $3.1 trillion was the biggest in absolute numbers and also the largest as a share of gross domestic product.The figures do not take into account the $1.9 trillion spending plan the Biden administration has introduced. If passed, that would likely mean the 2021 budget deficit was even larger than last year’s.The CBO estimates that federal debt held by the public, which hit 100 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2020, will reach 102 percent of GDP at the end of 2021, dip slightly for a few years, and then rise further. By 2031, debt would equal 107 percent of GDP, the highest in the nation’s history.The CBO projects GDP will grow by 3.7 percent in 2021, returning to its pre-pandemic level by the middle of the year, and afterward will grow an average of 2.6 percent over the following four years.  After that the CBO forecasts GDP growth to averages 1.6 percent.The Federal Reserve sees the economy growing much faster.

400,"The pancake mix and syrup line Aunt Jemima has formally rebranded itself as “The Pearl Milling Company,” parent company PepsiCo announced Tuesday.The rebranding effort was inspired by the milling company in St. Joseph, Missouri, which pioneered the pancake mix in 1888 that became known as Aunt Jemima, according to a press release.“The name and image of Aunt Jemima… do not reflect our core values,” the AuntJemima.com website now reads. The legacy Aunt Jemima products will continue to be sold until June, when the rebranded labels will arrive in stores.The company announced last June that the Aunt Jemima brand would be retired due to criticism of alleged racial stereotypes, vowing to “make progress toward racial equity” as protests raged nationwide over the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor. Quaker Oats, owned by PepsiCo, said it would also donate $5 million “‘to create meaningful, ongoing support and engagement in the Black community.”In Tuesday’s press release, the company said it soon reveal the recipients of a $1 million donation to organizations that “empower and uplift Black girls and women” as part of the rebranding effort.Several relatives say the company is snubbing the women who have played the “Aunt Jemima” character, including descendants of Anna Short Harrington and cousins of Lillian Richard. Nancy Green, a trailblazing black woman who birthed the “Aunt Jemima” character, was born a slave in Kentucky but became one of the first black corporate models in the nation.Other food brands — including Cream of Wheat, Mrs. Butterworth’s, Uncle Ben’s, and Eskimo Pie — similarly vowed to change or review their packages’ branding last summer.EconomyPre-ViralSocial JusticeAunt JemimaPepsicoQuaker OatsThe Pearl Milling Company.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
401,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank will keep monetary policy “patiently accommodative” even if prices jump later this year and urged lawmakers not to worry about budget deficits until the economy fully recovers.“Despite the surprising speed of recovery early on, we are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared,” Powell said Wednesday in a speech to the Economic Club of New York.Powell said an expansive fiscal policy is an “essential tool” for restoring the labor market.“Given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the post-pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy. It will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private sector,” Powell said. “The potential benefits of investing in our nation’s workforce are immense.”Powell’s remarks came as lawmakers consider the Biden administration’s proposal for a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief spending bill. Critics of the proposal—including leading liberal economists Larry Summers and Olivier Blanchard—have said the proposed spending is too high and risks triggering inflation.In stark contrast, Powell downplayed the risk of inflation from too much deficit spending. He said that prices could rise if demand surged as the economy reopened but this would be a temporary event that would not cause the Fed to raise rates or result in sustained inflation.Powell praised the progress made during the pre-pandemic Trump era, although he did not credit the Trump administration for the labor market’s strength.Fortunately, the participation rate after 2015 consistently outperformed expectations, and by the beginning of 2020, the prime-age participation rate had fully reversed its decline from the 2008-to-2015 period. Moreover, gains in participation were concentrated among people without a college degree. Given that U.S. labor force participation has lagged relative to other advanced economy nations, this progress was especially welcome.As I mentioned, we also saw faster wage growth for low earners once the labor market had strengthened sufficiently. Nearly six years into the recovery, wage growth for the lowest earning quartile had been persistently modest and well below the pace enjoyed by other workers. At the tipping point of 2015, however, as the labor market continued to strengthen, the trend reversed, with wage growth for the lowest quartile consistently and significantly exceeding that of other workers.At the end of 2015, the Black unemployment rate was still quite elevated, at 9 percent, despite the relatively low overall unemployment rate. But that disparity too began to shrink; as the expansion continued beyond 2015, Black unemployment reached a historic low of 5.2 percent, and the gap between Black and white unemployment rates was the narrowest since 1972, when data on unemployment by race started to be collected. Black unemployment has tended to rise more than overall unemployment in recessions but also to fall more quickly in expansions.4 Over the course of a long expansion, these persistent disparities can decline significantly, but, without policies to address their underlying causes, they may increase again when the economy ultimately turns down.These late-breaking improvements in the labor market did not result in unwanted upward pressures on inflation, as might have been expected; in fact, inflation did not even rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis. There was every reason to expect that the labor market could have strengthened even further without causing a worrisome increase in inflation were it not for the onset of the pandemic.The Fed chief painted a dour picture of the current labor market, saying that the unemployment rate is probably closer to 10 percent than the 6.4 percent in official figures. He said misclassification of some workers as employed and people dropping out of the labor force has led headline unemployment figures that “dramatically understated” the economic damage of the pandemic. EconomyPoliticscoronavirusCovidFederal ReserveJerome Powellpandemicunemployment.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

More importantly, however, the legislation would drive up the prices of goods and services, while also reducing employment by 1.4 million jobs. The report states:In 2025, when the minimum wage reached $15 per hour, employment would be reduced by 1.4 million workers [or 0.9 percent of all jobs], according to CBO’s average estimate. In 2021, most workers who would not have a job because of the higher minimum wage would still be looking for work and hence be categorized as unemployed.“Young, less educated people would account for a disproportionate share of those reductions in employment,” the CBO adds.The report comes as both Biden and Democrats have argued that raising the minimum wage should be included in the $1.9 trillion relief package meant to combat the economic impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Last month, in an address delivered from his home state of Delaware, Biden asserted that a $15 minimum wage was required to ensure “nobody working 40 hours a week should be living below the poverty line.”“There is real pain overwhelming the real economy, one where people rely on paychecks, not their investments, to pay for their bills and their meals and their children’s needs,” the president said.With the inclusion of the $15 minimum wage increase, the $1.9 trillion relief program has become controversial. Even moderate Democrats, like Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), have expressed concerns that such a large hike would overly burden small businesses already reeling because of the virus.Given the narrow vote margin required to pass the coronavirus relief package via budget reconciliation, a tactic allowing the Senate to pass legislation affecting spending and the revenue by a simple majority of 51 votes, it is unclear if Biden’s push for a $15 minimum wage will succeed.EconomyPolitics$15 minimum wageCongressional Budget OfficeCOVID-19Joe BidenJoe ManchinRaise the Wage Act.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
403,"Apart from gasoline, consumer prices barely budged in January.The consumer price index climbed three-tenths of a percentage point in January, the Labor Department said Wednesday. That was the fastest pace of inflation in five months.But most of that can be attributed to higher gasoline prices, which rose by 7.4 percent in January. Prices of food consumed at home, which can be volatile month-to-month, rose just one-tenth of a percent. Excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged in January.Prices are expected to rise this year as bank accounts inflated by pandemic relief payments and an accommodative Federal Reserve stance boost demand and the pandemic’s effect fades. But they are not rising yet.Even after two months of big hikes in gasoline prices, U.S. consumers are still paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. Compared with January of 2020, gas prices are down 8.8 percent.Compared with a year ago, the consumer price index is up 1.4 percent. That is far below the 2.3 percent year over year price climb seen before the pandemic.Prices of some items are up. Used car prices have skyrocketed and are 10 percent above the year-ago level. The index for major appliances is up 15.8 percent, led by a 23.1 percent gain in washing machines. Grocery prices are up 3.8 percent year-over-year.But these price hikes have been offset by declines in other categories. Clothing prices are down 2.5 percent compared with a year ago, led by the a 15.6 percent decline in men’s suits. Women’s dress prices have fallen 11.6 percent. Phone prices have fallen 17.8 percent, which may indicate that a non-trivial part of the demand for new phones was due to social status signaling.Economygasolinegasoline prices.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
404,"The year 2020 saw more hiring than ever before in American history.Seventy-million hires occurred despite the burden of the pandemic, the most in records that date back to the late 1990s, according to data released Tuesday by the Department of Labor.There were also more involuntary discharges and layoffs last year. The same data set shows 75 million layoffs, leaving the country with a 5 million employment gap.The data, which comes from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, include people who may have been hired or layed off more than once in the year. In total, there were around 150 million Americans employed at the end of 2020, down 8.7 million from a year earlier.The data show that monthly layoffs spiked higher than monthly hires in March and April, another first time event. But layoffs through the rest of the year continued to run at or below historically normal levels.Hiring spiked in May and June, reaching the highest level ever, and then continued at historically normal levels until they declined again in December.This rapid gyration of the economy is very different from the last recession. Hiring fell steeply from October 2007 and kept declining until June of 2009, a painful twenty-month drag. And once hiring began to recover, it did so at a snail’s pace.

405,"Alex Kearns took his own life on June 12. Now his parents are suing stock trading app Robinhood for the circumstances leading to his suicide.A 20-year-old college student, waiting out the coronavirus pandemic with his family, killed himself under the mistaken impression that he had turned his roughly $5,000 savings into $730,000 in debt. Alex Kearns had come home from college early, to stay with his parents under quarantine, in what his father, Dan Kearns, called a “joyful household” despite the grim global situation at the time.Dorothy Kearns remembered Alex, the “love of her life,” as the boy who would spend his evenings helping her in the kitchen. During one of those evenings, her son expressed both doubt and determination toward his future. “One night he says to me, he’s like, ‘Mom, I don’t — I don’t know what I want to do with my life yet. But I do know I want to help people,’” she remembered.Alex wanted to try his hand as an investor in the stock market, and, like millions of others, chose to do so through a free app called “Robinhood,” whose stated mission is to “democratize finance” by providing a platform for anyone to trade without commissions or fees. As they said during their contentious Super Bowl ad: “You don’t need to become an investor; you were born one.”At the time, Dan could not have anticipated the consequences of the experience. “I didn’t see the harm in doing that.” Dan Kearns said, explaining that he spoke with his son about the idea and understood he had “limited exposure.” What neither parent realized is that Robinhood had approved their son for options trading — a significantly more risky endeavor.On June 11, Alex was alerted to restrictions on his account, due to what appeared to be a negative balanced of $730,000. The company sent him an automated e-mail demanding “immediate action,” and giving him just a few days to pay $170,000. “He thought he blew up his life. He thought he screwed up beyond repair,” Dan Kearns said.Alex reached out to customer service with a simple plea for help. “I was incorrectly assigned more money than I should have, my bought puts should have covered the puts I sold,” he wrote. “Could someone please look into this?” The automated reply assigned him a case number, saying the response could be “delayed.” A few hours later, at 3:23 a.m. on June 12, the local sheriff arrived Dan and Dorothy’s residence to tell them their son was dead.A day later, another automated e-mail arrived from Robinhood. “Great news!” it said, “We’re reaching out to confirm that you’ve met your margin call and we’ve lifted your trade restrictions. If you have any questions about your margin call, please feel free to reach out. We’re happy to help!”The Kearns family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Robinhood, accusing them of both negligent infliction of emotional distress, and unfair business practices, along with a failure to provide “meaningful customer support” they believe could have saved their son from the despair that motivated him to take his own life.“The information they gave him was just incredibly skewed. And possibly completely wrong, because they make it look like you owe $730,000 when you really don’t owe anything,” said Benjamin Blakeman, a Kearns family attorneys. “That could panic just about anybody.” Worse, “they provide no mechanism through a telephone call, through live email service, to get live answers to questions,” fellow Kearns family attorney Ethan Brown said.William Galvin, Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth and the chief financial regulator in the state of Massachusetts, is also eyeing Robinhood, as well as other apps for amateur investors. He believes situations like the one leading to Alex’s suicide point to a need for better regulation.“I think it demands some sort of national standard for this behavior,” he said. “There was a very deliberate effort on the part of Robinhood to particularly entice younger, inexperienced investors.” His office filed a formal complaint against Robinhood in December. “They have not acted in the best interests of their customers. So the idea that they’re caring for the poor,” he said, “is simply not true.”For Alex, any justice will come too late. Dan believes his son was trying to save his family from “what he thought was impending financial disaster” and simply needed “a little help.” He said his son mistakenly believed “he blew up his life” and he had “screwed up beyond repair.”The family is still reeling from the loss. “I lost the love of my life. I miss him more than anything,” Dorothy said. “I can’t tell you how incredibly painful it is. It’s the kind of pain that I don’t think should be humanly possible for a parent to overcome.”EconomyHealthTechinvestmentsRobinhoodstock market.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
406,"The American people are feeling better about their own work situation but they are worried about the direction of the labor market, according to a survey released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Expectations that unemployment will be higher a year from now increased from 38.9 percent in December to 40.2 percent in January, according to the bank’s Survey of Consumer Expectations. That is the third-highest reading of the year after sky-high scores in March and April. The increase was sharper among households with less than $50,000 of household income, lower education, and Americans over 60.Yet at the same time, the probability Americans assign to losing their own job in the next 12 months fell for the third consecutive month from 15.0 percent in December to 13.6 percent in January, the lowest reading since September 2019. The decrease was more pronounced among respondents with lower education—no more than a high school degree—and less than $50,000 of household income.In other words, some of the same demogaphic categories that see the bigger picture darkening also think they are becoming less likely to lose their own job.Americans are also expecting to spend more. The increase of households’ expected level of spending a year from now jumped to 4.2 percent, the highest reading since June 2015. Americans also forecast their future incomes would rise by 2.4 percent, up two-tenths of a percentage point from the prior month and the highest reading since February 2020, before the pandemic struck. That suggests that American households expect to spend down some of the savings that have been accumulated during a year of social distancing, staying-at-home, and lockdowns.“Respondents were also slightly more optimistic about their households’ financial situations in the year ahead with more respondents expecting their financial situation to improve a year from now,” the New York Fed’s report said.The survey also found highest level of expected home price gains since May 2014 and stable inflation expectations.EconomyNY Fedunemployment.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
407,"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) slammed President Joe Biden’s administration amid evidence that his deputies want to minimize the deportation of illegal migrants who are caught dealing deadly drugs.“It’s the Biden administration policy to allow illegal aliens to stay in America even after they: -Deal fentanyl and heroin -Commit fraud -Commit assault -Drive drunk -Launder money,” Cotton tweeted February 8.“More than 80,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year. And the Biden administration just announced that deporting illegal alien cartel members who deal with fentanyl and heroin is no longer a priority for his administration,” he added.For more than 20 years, many Americans have been killed by drunk-driving illegals, including many killed after federal and state officials decide not to deport illegals.It's the Biden administration policy to allow illegal aliens to stay in America even after they:-Deal fentanyl and heroin-Commit fraud-Commit assault-Drive drunk-Launder moneyhttps://t.co/Vr0RhYAJQV— Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) February 8, 2021The Washington Post reported February 7 how Biden’s deputies are changing deportation priorities for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency:While ICE’s new operational plans are not yet final, interim instructions sent to senior officials point to a major shift in enforcement. Agents will no longer seek to deport immigrants for crimes such as driving under the influence and assault, and will focus instead on national security threats, recent border crossers and people completing prison and jail terms for aggravated felony convictions.“Generally, these convictions would not include drug based crimes (less serious offenses), simple assault, DUI, money laundering, property crimes, fraud, tax crimes, solicitation, or charges without convictions,” acting director Tae Johnson told senior officials in a Thursday email advising them on how to operate while new guidelines are finalized.“The priority for the enforcement of immigration laws will be on those who are imposing a national security threat, of course, a public safety threat, and on recent arrivals,” Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in the February 8 White House press briefing:Nobody is saying that DUIs or assaults are acceptable behavior, and those arrested for such activities should be tried and sentenced as appropriate by local law enforcement. But we’re talking about the prioritization of who is going to be deported from the country.The priority list for deportations also excludes migrants who take American’ jobs and wages. This policy will largely abandon the task of protecting Americans’ right to a national labor market.Biden has repeatedly declared he wants to make the nation’s immigration system more “fair” to migrants. Since January 20, he has minimized deportations, stopped construction of the border wall, offered an amnesty to migrants, broken anti-migration deals with three counties, and has lowered legal barriers to migration.However, he has said little or nothing about how he will protect Americans’ rights, wages, safe streets, and reasonable housing from foreign criminals or job seekers. A February 2 statement said:President Biden’s strategy is centered on the basic premise that our country is safer, stronger, and more prosperous with a fair, safe and orderly immigration system that welcomes immigrants, keeps families together, and allows people—both newly arrived immigrants and people who have lived here for generations—to more fully contribute to our country.Amid Biden’s inrush of migrants and shutdown of deportations, more than 20 million Americans are unemployed or are stuck in part-time jobs.Biden is also rolling back protections for American graduates, who have lost at least one million jobs because Fortune 500 CEOs and their subcontractors have hired more than 1 million foreign graduates for jobs sought by Americans.In a separate tweet, Cotton lambasted Biden’s team for dropping a rule that would protect American graduate from losing jobs to H-1B graduate visa-workers who are willing to work for low wages in the hope of getting green cards:Big Tech abuses the H-1B visa program to hire cheap foreign labor instead of Americans. That isn’t good for American workers, but the Biden administration is letting companies get away with it.https://t.co/YIolIoyqJl— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) February 5, 2021For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the hiring of temporary contract workers into the jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, priority-driven, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and immigration in theory.Joe Biden's deputies attack Americans' right to their own national labor market, by quietly barring the deportation of illegal migrants who take Americans' wages and jobs.

408,"The Boeing Company is outsourcing 600 American information technology (IT) jobs to Dell Technologies, which regularly imports foreign visa workers, while expanding its production base in India.This month, Boeing executives announced that they would be outsourcing hundreds of IT jobs to Dell Technologies — about 10 percent of the company’s IT employees — as it intends to lay off 11,000 of its employees this year after laying off 20,000 last year.Dell, which will absorb some of Boeing’s IT work, has a record of outsourcing American jobs to imported foreign visa workers through the H-1B visa program. Through one of its many subsidiaries, Dell sought to bring 600 H-1B foreign visa workers to the U.S. this year to take American jobs at an average salary of $119,000.Between 2018 and 2020, Dell sought to import nearly 1,700 H-1B foreign visa workers to take American jobs at average salaries ranging from $109,000 to $119,000.While Boeing outsources hundreds of jobs to Dell, the company is expanding its production capacity in India after one of its manufacturers in China was put on a U.S. blacklist for its ties to the Chinese Communist Party, according to Business Insider:Boeing said Friday it has added a new production line at Tata Boeing Aerospace Limited, its joint venture in Hyderabad, India, to manufacture complex vertical fin structures for 737 Max single-aisle jets. [Emphasis added]…Boeing employs 3,000 people in India, and more than 7,000 people work with its supply chain partners. [Emphasis added]…Boeing 737 vertical fins are now made by Chinese manufacturers at Aviation Industry Corporation of China, Ltd. AVIC was recently added to a U.S Defense department list of companies banned from receiving exports by U.S. aerospace companies. [Emphasis added]While hundreds — and potentially thousands — of Americans are set to lose their jobs at Boeing this year, the company’s CEO Dave Calhoun is likely to continue raking in a lucrative salary. When Calhoun took over as head of Boeing earlier last year, he stepped into a large pay scale.“According to the filing, Calhoun gets a base salary of $1.4 million to start,” Barron’s reported: Total annual compensation, including bonuses and long-term incentive awards will come to about $11 million a year. There is an additional $7 million payment tied solely to 737 MAX milestones. (Details of the MAX milestones weren’t included.) Calhoun will also receive a $10 million payment—like a signing bonus in connection with foregone compensation at other employers—for taking the top job. [Emphasis added]Outsourcing Americans’ jobs to imported H-1B foreign visa workers is often the first step by corporations in their plans to fully offshore their production and business services.Every year, more than 100,000 foreign workers are brought to the U.S. on the H-1B visa and are allowed to stay for up to six years. There are about 650,000 H-1B visa foreign workers in the U.S. at any given moment. Americans are often laid off in the process and forced to train their foreign replacements, as highlighted by Breitbart News.More than 85,000 Americans annually potentially lose their jobs to foreign labor through the H-1B visa program. Despite an ongoing pandemic, about 37,000 Americans lost their jobs to outsourcing last year.Like other Defense Department contractors, Boeing profits hugely from American taxpayer money. In 2017, the company noted that about 79 percent of its profits came from government contracts with the U.S. federal government.

409,"President Joe Biden’s lax border policies will deliver “an unending flood of foreign nationals into the United States,” says a new report by two senior GOP representatives that ignores the economic damage of labor migration.“The Trump Administration made the U.S. safer,” says the February 8 report by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the top Republican on the judiciary committee, and Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA), the top Republican on the committee’ s immigration and citizenship panel.The report cites “security” roughly 40 times, it mentions “safe” or “safety” 40 times, and gives 37 mentions of  “criminal,” including this sentence: “President Biden will reinstitute ‘catch and release’ policies that will allow dangerous criminal aliens to roam free in American neighborhoods.”The report also highlights the economic costs of supporting poor migrants with a section on Biden’s plan to cut President Donald Trump’s “public charge” regulation.But the GOP report is just the first in a series, a House staffer told Breitbart News. Expect more economic analysis in the future reports, he said.Rob Law, director of regulatory affairs and immigration policy at the Center for Immigration studies said:It is great that the GOP is recognizing that immigration policy is economic policy. The supply of cheap labor has an economic impact on Americans, and it disproportionally harms middle America .. [by] outsourcing jobs from the middle of the country to the coasts.This first report completely ignores the economic impact of migration, which is the impact felt most by Americans as they try to get jobs, raise their wages, and buy homes.The 32-page report does not mention wages or salaries, rising home prices, or the damage to Americans’ education in their schools and universities.The report ignores the impact of visa workers. They include the million-plus H-1Bs and OPTs who take white-collar jobs from U.S. graduates, or the H-2A program, which takes work from Americans in the agriculture sector.The report also does not mention the growing damage to Americans’ innovation, research, or even productivity, by the flood of cheap and compliant foreign labor.The report has a few glancing references to economics. For example, the report suggests that Biden’s push to raise the inflow of refugees may hurt Americans:President Biden promised to set the refugee ceiling at 125,000 refugees initially and to raise it annually. This arbitrary number is nothing more than virtue signaling to the radical left. At a time when Americans are suffering from a global pandemic and the American people are trying to jump start the economy, admitting high numbers of refugees is a poor decision that will only exacerbate economic challenges.The 32-page report also has one mention of American’ worksites, many of which are being filled up by legal immigrants, illegals, and visa workers:Interior security policies include … worksite enforcement to ensure employers do not hire and employ illegal aliens, and the arrest and removal of deportable aliens. Where President Trump enhanced immigration enforcement on the interior of the U.S., President Biden has pledged to reduce interior enforcement, a move that will only endanger American citizens and legal immigrants.The report is also silent about immigration’s impact on the geographic spread of new wealth. By funneling extra workers to coastal investors, the government’s immigration policy shifts investment, jobs, wages, careers, and wealth away from small towns and inland states over to large cities and the coastal states.For example, Jordan’s Ohio got just $1.5 billion of venture capital investment during the last quarter of 202o, according to data produced by SSTI.org. That is just $125 per person and is far less than the $2,353 per person share investment in Massachusetts, where companies and universities import many OPT, J-1, and H-1B workers.Americans’ right to their labor market has long been diluted by the federal government’s willingness to import more labor for use by companies. The extra labor is delivered by legal immigrants, illegal migrants, refugees, legal visa workers, work-permit foreign graduates, temporarily legal illegal aliens, asylum claimants, and work licenses for illegal aliens.Decades of data and experiences have persuaded the vast majority of Americans — and many elite economists, lobbyists, and legislators — that migration moves money out of employees’ pockets and into the stock market wealth of investors and their progressive supporters.Migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.Migration allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, shortchange labor in the cities, impose tight control and pay cuts on American professionals, corral technological innovation by minimizing the employment of innovative American graduates, undermine Americans’ labor rights, and redirect progressive journalists to cheerlead for Wall Street’s priorities and claims.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the hiring of temporary contract workers into the jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, priority-driven, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and immigration in theory.The inflow of India's visa-workers creates a huge 'bonded labor' workforce that empowers Fortune 500 CEOs & shrivels professionalism, say US/India tech-professionals.

410,"All Democrat Senators voted against an amendment to preserve the Remain in Mexico barrier to migrants — including five Democrat Senators who face tough races in 2022.The five Senators cast their unpopular votes in a February 4, multi-amendment “vote-a-rama” debate. The rare debate was required by the multi-stage process to create a far-reaching “reconciliation” bill that can be voted through the Senate with a bare majority.President Joe Biden and his progressive deputies are canceling the Remain in Mexico Program, which is also titled the Migrant Protection Protocols. The program was created by President Trump to exclude economic migrants from the U.S. labor market while they wait for asylum judges to hear their claims. The program was a complete success, and it slashed migrant arrivals from roughly 144,000 in May 2019 to 45,000 in October 2020.The program works because it breaks the coyotes’ conveyer belt by preventing migrants from repaying their smuggling debts with wages earned at U.S. jobs.Pro-migration groups hate the program and claim that it exposes migrants to dangers in Mexico while they wait for asylum hearings. But the program also reduces overall harm because it sharply reduces the number of migrants who are enticed to enter the obstacle course migration system for blue-collar migrants — a chaotic Hunger Games trail of loans, coyotes, cartels, rape, deserts, weather, border laws, barriers, rescuers, transport, judges, and cheap-labor employers.#USBP Hebbronville agents along with #Borstar and the local Fire Department responded to a 911 distress call.

Over 50,000 asylum seekers have been waiting in Mexico rather than in the United States, where they often disappear while waiting in the 1 million-person asylum case backlog. This was an important change that the Trump administration put in place, and it is a serious mistake to reverse it.Graham’s job-protecting measure was rejected by all Democratic Senators, including all of the Democratic Senators who face the voters in November 2022.

411,"The labor market may have ended the year in slightly better shape than thought.The number of job openings climbed in December to 6.6 million, up from 6.5 million in November. Economists had forecast a decline to 6.4 million jobs.The figures come from the Labor Department’s monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, known as JOLTS, released Tuesday.The better than expected news on openings contrasts with other data that showed a bleak end of the year in the labor market. The monthly employment situation report, also from the Labor Department, showed that total employment shrank by 227,000 in December.The contrast suggests that the pandemic may be making it difficult for employers to find workers to fill open jobs. In December, the number of hires fell a seasonally adjusted 396,000 to 5.5 million even though employers were looking for more workers. Most of that decline came in the private sector, where hires fell by a seasonally adjusted 384,000.Some industries held up better than others in December. Hires in construction rose and held steady in manufacturing, while job openings contracted somewhat in both sectors.Retail trade hiring accelerated from 724,000 in  November to 818,000 in December, in seasonally adjusted figures. That is above the pre-pandemic year-ago level of 772,000.There was a sharp decline in leisure and hospitality. Hires fell from 1.079 million in November to 777,000 in December. A year earlier, there were 1,165 hires in the sector. Openings also plunged, falling from 888,000 in November to 761,000, well-below the year-earlier figure of 916,000.

Many parents have directed money that might otherwise be spent on travel or eating to spending on toys and games for learning-from-home children, many of whom have been cut off from access to peers.Revenue rose 10 percent to $1.63 billion in the fourth quarter, Mattel said.  Adjusted profit increased to 40 cents a share, well above the forecasted 24 cents. Margins improved as well.“The fourth quarter and full year demonstrated the resilience of the toy industry and the priority that parents place on quality toys, trusted brands and purposeful play,” Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz said in a statement.The company said sales in North America segment were 13 percent higher in the fourth quarter than a year ago. For the full year, sales were up 7 percent.Barbie sales were up a whopping 18 percent compared with the prior year’s fourth quarter.Sales in the company’s American Girl segment rose 9 percent, the first quarter of year-over-year growth in four years.

414,"South Korean trade minister Yoo Myung-hee withdrew her candidacy for leadership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Friday, clearing the field for Nigerian economist and former trade minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to take the position. Okonjo-Iweala had the backing of China, Japan, Australia, most of Africa, and the European Union, while Yoo was the favored candidate of the United States under the previous administration.The previous head of the WTO, Roberto Azevedo of Brazil, became director-general in 2013 and was supposed to remain until 2021, but he stepped down a year early in September, saying it was important for his successor to be chosen before the next WTO ministerial meeting.“The selection process would be a distraction from — or worse, a disruption to — our desired outcomes,” Azevedo said when he announced his early resignation, describing the selection of director-general as “a politically-charged process that has proved divisive in the past.” Some observers thought he was choosing the worst possible time to leave, given the worldwide economic stresses of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. The Trump administration considered withdrawing from the WTO entirely, having criticized it for abusing its authority in some areas, while not doing enough to correct China’s unfair trade practices.In the final round of voting in October, after six other candidates were winnowed out, Okonjo-Iweala reportedly received about 100 of the 164 votes from WTO member states. Yoo was not required to drop out as a result of the final round vote, so she stayed in the race while the U.S. presidential election played out. The U.S. blocked the WTO from using the results of the final-round voting to anoint Okonjo-Iweala.The Trump administration’s trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, praised Yoo as a “bona fide trade expert who has distinguished herself during a 25-year career as a successful trade negotiator and trade policymaker.” On the other hand, Lighthizer said appointing Okonjo-Iweala would be a “mistake” because she has “no experience in trade at all.”“We need a person who actually knows trade, not somebody from the World Bank who does development,” Lighthizer said in January. “There are very few areas where you would say, ‘Here’s an organization in very bad shape, let’s get someone who knows nothing about its core mission.’”Yoo, 54, was South Korea’s first female trade minister, appointed to the post by President Moon Jae-in in 2019. Educated in the United States and experienced at negotiating with China, supportive of the WTO’s core mission but aware of the organization’s deficiencies, she appealed to her supporters as a solid compromise candidate whose appointment might have prompted the international community to “cease treating China as the only significant voice in Asia,” as Thomas Byrne of the Korea Society argued in a November op-ed at The Diplomat.Yoo said Friday she was withdrawing because the future of the WTO had become “uncertain” due to “the prolonged vacancy of leadership.”“To speed up the consensus building among the member countries on selecting a new director-general, I have decided to renounce my candidacy through close cooperation with the United States, our strong ally,” she said.“Washington, which showed strong support for my candidacy, also respects the decision to step down from the race,” she added.Okonjo-Iweala, 66, was Nigeria’s first female foreign minister in addition to serving as finance minister. She also had a 25-year career with the World Bank that culminated in her becoming its managing director. Like Yoo, she was educated in the United States, graduating from Harvard and MIT. She holds dual American and Nigerian citizenship.AFP noted Friday that “not everyone agrees her track record is impeccable,” quoting criticism that huge sums of Nigerian oil revenue disappeared while she was finance minister, and she did not do enough against her country’s endemic corruption.“At the very least, she had the opportunity to resign from office and expose the corruption. Rather, she kept quiet and allowed high level corruption to fester under the regime, only to complain after leaving office,” human rights activist Olanrewaju Suraju complained.AFP noted Okonjo-Iweala has criticized “growing protectionism and nationalism” and has called for “some of the barriers created by intellectual property and technology transfer laws” to be removed so coronavirus vaccines can be more “equitably distributed.”Such positions would not have been welcomed by the Trump White House, which was very concerned about China getting away with unfair trade practices and astounding levels of intellectual property theft. According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Okonjo-Iweala “fought tooth and nail to win over the Trump administration, but to no avail.”The SCMP quoted analysts who expected Okonjo-Iweala to fare much better with the Biden administration, which might have signaled South Korea that Yoo should withdraw and clear the way for her rival:In a recent op-ed for the Hinrich Foundation, former Trump trade official Clete Willems wrote that the new US government “is likely to lift the hold on the naming of a new WTO director general, to more actively work with allies through the system to hold China accountable for its unfair trade practices, and to engage in fewer overtly provocative unilateral trade actions”.Biden’s pick to replace Lighthizer as USTR, Katherine Tai, has yet to be confirmed, but is also thought to strongly favor engaging with the Geneva institution.CNN on Friday anticipated President Joe Biden would “proceed with caution when it comes to signing any new trade deals” despite his dedication to multilateral institutions, hinting Biden might be wary of antagonizing pandemic-weary American middle-class voters by moving too quickly. However, Politico noted Biden’s team has “said it preferred a swift move to appoint a WTO head.”A spokesperson for Okonjo-Iweala said she “looks forward to the conclusion of the director-general selection process” and congratulated Yoo on her “long campaign.”“The WTO must turn its focus to the Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic and global economic recovery. Dr Okonjo-Iweala is eager to focus on the many needed reforms at the WTO. She is humbled by the support she has received from WTO members and of champions in Nigeria and other parts of the world,” the spokesperson said.EconomyNational SecurityChinaDonald TrumpJoe BidenNigeriaSouth KoreaWorld Trade Organization (WTO).Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
415,"President Joe Biden’s deputies have demolished the diplomatic border wall that allowed U.S. border agencies to swiftly reject economic migrants arriving from South America, Africa, India, and many other countries.“This is just excellent news,” tweeted Clara Long, an associate director at HRW.org, a pro-migration group.The wall was the U.S.-Guatemala Asylum Cooperative Agreement (ACA), which allowed U.S. agents to fly almost any migrant to Guatemala if they traveled through Guatemala on their way toward the U.S. border.  That legal capability was extensive because Guatemala covers the full width of Central America. To avoid entering Guatemala, migrants from South America would have had to travel by sea around the country.The Guatemalan government just announced that the US has formally transmitted notice that it is withdrawing from the Asylum Cooperative Agreement (Safe Third Country agreement).The US-Guatemala ACA was the only one that ever went into actual effect.H/t @GreciaOrtzJR https://t.co/EmwICSq6ZX— Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@ReichlinMelnick) February 5, 2021The demolition comes as border agents have begun releasing migrants through the concrete-and-steel border wall and into the United States. The catch and release policy is creating an incentive for many more migrants to travel to the United States via Guatemala in the hope of getting U.S. jobs. and even U.S. citizenship from Biden’s draft amnesty.This decision will help progressives to entice more poor people into the deadly Hunger Games migration route to the United States. The obstacle course migration system rewards blue-collar migrants who overcome coyotes, cartels, rape, deserts, weather, border laws, barriers, rescuers, transport, judges, and cheap labor employers.Business groups and investors gain because the progressives provide them with profit-boosting, cheap foreign workers, government-funded consumers, and multiple renters for apartments.In 2016, Americans elected President Donald Trump to solve the migration problem and to restore their right to a national labor market. By early 2020, he had largely shut down the deadly route by barring nearly all migrants from getting into the United States.Progressives (& biz) cheerlead the 'Hunger Games' obstacle-course trail that delivers migrants to the US, despite Americans' expectation for a capped & orderly immig system. The trail inflicts much damage & death, but progressives demand diversity first.https://t.co/90s5dnQQ4l— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) January 11, 2021Biden’s officials oppose the popular curbs on migration and hope to build new pipelines to extract young people from their home countries for use by the U.S. economy.On February 2, Biden signed an Executive Order calling for the creation of the extra pipelines:The Collaborative Management Strategy should focus on programs and infrastructure that facilitate access to protection and other lawful immigration avenues, in both the United States and partner countries, as close to migrants’ homes as possible.  Priorities should include support for expanding pathways through which individuals facing difficult or dangerous conditions in their home countries can find stability and safety in receiving countries throughout the region, not only through asylum and refugee resettlement, but also through labor and other non-protection-related programs.Pro-migration advocates claimed the ACA deal was unfair, in part, as Guatemala does not have a well-run process for accepting asylum seekers. For example, HRW.org complained:Transferees under the ACA were thrust into a high-pressure situation in which they lacked adequate time and resources to make truly informed, voluntary choices about what to do. Once transferees were registered at the airport, they had 72 hours to make the decision about whether they would remain in Guatemala, return to the countries they fled, or try to find refuge elsewhere.[9] The Guatemalan government’s 72-hour time limit is arbitrary and coercive, giving transferees insufficient time to make such monumental decisions.Joe Biden's EOs on migration show the Democrats want to import poor (IOW, gov't dependent) migrants & they care little about the resulting damage to the sending countries.

417,"President Joe Biden’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency will stop deporting migrants who violate Americans’ right to their own national labor market, according to a report in the Washington Post.The Washington Post reported on February 7 that Biden’s draft policy says agents will not be allowed to deport illegal migrants caught taking American’ jobs and wages:While ICE’s new operational plans are not yet final, interim instructions sent to senior officials point to a major shift in enforcement. Agents will no longer seek to deport immigrants for crimes such as driving under the influence and assault, and will focus instead on national security threats, recent border crossers and people completing prison and jail terms for aggravated felony convictions.“Generally, these convictions [needed for deportation] would not include drug based crimes (less serious offenses), simple assault, DUI, money laundering, property crimes, fraud, tax crimes, solicitation, or charges without convictions,” acting director Tae Johnson told senior officials in a Thursday email advising them on how to operate while new guidelines are finalized.“They’ve abolished ICE without abolishing ICE,” an agency official told the Washington Post. “It literally feels like we’ve gone from the ability to fully enforce our immigration laws to now being told to enforce nothing.”Biden’s policy “is a green light to businesses to discriminate against Americans” by hiring illegal aliens, said Rob Law, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “The administration is depriving Americans of their right to earn a decent living … it is a blatant transfer of wealth and opportunity away from American labor, and to greedy corporate interests,” he told Breitbart News.Under 8 U.S. Code § 1324a, passed by Congress in 1952, companies are barred from hiring foreigners unless the foreigners have work permits:(1) In generalIt is unlawful for a person or other entity—(A) to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien (as defined in subsection (h)(3)) with respect to such employment …The law has been the bedrock of Americans’ labor rights, social status, and economic prosperity because it forces wealthy employers to bargain with the limited supply of American workers — roughly 150 million — by offering decent wages and conditions.If the law is ignored, unauthorized foreigners will face minimal risk of deportation for working illegally — providing they do not commit major cries.The flood of illegal labor will allow all employers to cut their pay offers to Americans who need to maintain a decent living standard, buy homes, and raise children. The money saved from pay cuts is normally diverted to company profits and stock values, not productivity-boosting innovation, automation, and training.The GOP’s business wing has repeatedly tried to abolish Americans’ right to a national labor market. For example, President George W. Bush touted his plan for “Any Willing Worker” plan.Joe Biden's deputies have demolished the Guatemalan asylum deal as they try to expand migration into Americans' labor market. They're also reopening their deadly Hunger Games trek to the US border – and will blame Americans for the inevitable deaths. https://t.co/MY7mHbw65X— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) February 6, 2021Biden has given little evidence that he will step up the prosecution of CEOs for hiring illegal aliens.During his tenure, deputies for President Donald Trump allowed some workplace enforcement, usually in low-wage worksites, such as chicken-disassembly plants. In August 2019, for example, Americans were able to get jobs at high wages following a series of workplaces rid by ICE in Georgia. President Barack Obama also allowed some workplace enforcement. But neither president did anything significant to enforce Americans’ workplace rights at white-collar worksites.Biden’s deputies have already canceled an ICE office that was created to prevent discrimination against American graduates by CEOs who are eager to hire the many foreign graduates who accept low wages if they can stay in the United States.At the border, Biden’s deputies have begun welcoming a massive wave of migrant families seeking to join their illegal migrant spouses and fathers who are now working U.S. jobs.The importance of Americans’ right to their national labor market was described in July 2020 by Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Peter Thiel’s venture capital fund, Thiel Capital. In a July 2020 interview, he told Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX):You have the right to your own [national] labor market. Given that your country maintains a right to conscript you [for war, and] to tax you, [then one] part of the social contract is that [Americans] get a share in your country’s wealth through having a right [to work in the United States, without competition from foreign nationals]. Now the interesting part about it is, if we [elites] can just get your right declared [to be] an impediment to the free market, we can take your right [by forcing you to compete against foreign workers in the United States] without having to pay you anything for it.The managerial elite — “the center” — is using migration to steal wages and value from Americans, Weinstein said:There’s a huge problem that we need to get to, which is that the reason that we can’t get out of our national nightmare at the moment, is that the center has to make a move that it refuses to do. And the center — or “the core” would be a better way of saying it — has to admit that it became kleptocratic. And so the corruption of the core left and the core right means that there’s nowhere [for Americans] to turn.Americans’ right to their labor market has long been diluted by the federal government’s willingness to import more labor for use by companies. The extra labor is delivered by legal immigrants, illegal migrants, refugees, legal visa workers, work-permit foreign graduates, temporarily legal illegal aliens, asylum claimants, and work licenses for illegal aliens.Decades of data and experiences have persuaded the vast majority of Americans — and many elite economists, lobbyists, and legislators — that migration moves money out of employees’ pockets and into the stock market wealth of investors and their progressive supporters.Migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.Migration allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, shortchange labor in the cities, impose tight control and pay cuts on American professionals, corral technological innovation by minimizing the employment of innovative American graduates, undermine Americans’ labor rights, and redirect progressive journalists to cheerlead for Wall Street’s priorities and claims.The public’s recognition of this “Wages to Wall Street” economic policy comes amid perpetual insistence from business lobbies — and reporters — that supply and demand in the labor market are unrelated.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the hiring of temporary contract workers into the jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, priority-driven, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and immigration in theory.Another poll shows that ""immigration reform"" is a low priority for Americans, who – rationally & decently – prefer better jobs & wages for fellow Americans.

418,"One of the world’s leading liberal economists dealt Joe Biden a blow in recent days, warning that the president’s $1.9 trillion covid relief legislation could ignite an inflationary conflagration.Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and perhaps the most cited economist in the world, spelled out his case against the Biden bill in a series of tweets on Saturday.Blanchard’s argument is that the size of the stimulus injected into the economy would be too large, especially when added to the measures taken last year. The additional spending power created by the additional $1.9 trillion budget deficit would drive up prices and force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates.Let’s look at the numbers. Size does matter and can be assessed. If the economy had continued on its pre-covid trend, it would be about 900 billion dollars larger.  This suggests an output gap of less than 900 billion as some sectors will not operate at full speed for some time.— Olivier Blanchard (@ojblanchard1) February 6, 2021If this increase in demand could be accommodated, it would lead to  a level of output at 14% above potential.   It would take the unemployment rate very close to zero.This would not be overheating; it would be starting a fire.— Olivier Blanchard (@ojblanchard1) February 6, 2021Why go there?   Why force the Fed to in effect cancel some of the Biden package?  Could I be wrong and too pessimistic?  Sure. Multipliers could turn out to be very small, maybe 0.25.  I see no strong reason for it.— Olivier Blanchard (@ojblanchard1) February 6, 2021A careful economist, Blanchard follows up his tweets with warnings that some of the estimations he uses could be wrong. Perhaps the stimulus will have a smaller multiplier effect, he says, so it would not hit the economy with as much force as expected. Or the economy’s ability to expand production to meet the additional command could be greater. Nonetheless, the $1.9 trillion would be too large under any reasonable assumptions, he argues.
Like many economists grounded in the work of John Maynard Keynes, Blanchard thinks that deficit spending can be helpful to help an economy overcome a shortfall. But too much of it can result in unwanted inflation. In another tweet, he posted an interview in which he approved of deficit spending to deal directly with pandemic related health care costs and longer-term investments but warned about financing consumption through debt.By coincidence, the episode of econofactorg covers my views about the current US package. https://t.co/cLbVURCaFY— Olivier Blanchard (@ojblanchard1) February 8, 2021Blanchard’s objections to the Biden plan make him the second leading liberal economist to raise the alarm about the size of the proposal. Last week, Larry Summers—who was Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration and chief White House economist in the Obama administration—said the Biden plan was risky because it was so much larger than the hole the pandemic punched in the U.S. economy.The warnings coming from stalwart liberal economists could be a problem for the Biden administration because the Democrats’ hold on the House is slim and the Senate is evenly divided. Moderate Democrat defections could bring down a bill and the threat of such defections would likely force the White House to pare back the ambitious spending package. EconomyPoliticsLarry SummersOlivier Blanchard.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

420,"New weekly jobless claims fell to 779,000 in the week that ended January 30, the Department of Labor said Thursday.Economists had expected claims to fall to 835,000 from the 847,000 previously reported for the prior week. The previous week was revised down to 812,000.The four-week moving average—viewed by many economists as a better gauge of the labor market because it smooths out weekly volatility—was 848,250, a decrease of 1,250 from the previous week’s revised average.Continuing claims fell to 4,592,000, a decrease of 193,000 from the previous week’s revised level.The unexpectedly steep decline in claims may complicate the push for the $1.9 trillion economic aid package proposed by the Biden White House. If the economy is recovering faster than expected, some lawmakers who might have supported the bill could decide a smaller and more targeted package would be appropriate. Republican lawmakers have proposed a $619 billion package they say is better tailored to the current economic conditions.Jobless claims—which are a proxy for layoffs—remain at extremely high levels. Prior to the pandemic, the highest level of claims was 695,000 hit in October of 1982. In March of 2009, at the depths of the financial crisis recession, jobless claims peaked at 665,000.Even when the economy is creating a lot of demand for workers, many businesses will shed employees as they adjust to market conditions. But in a high-pressure labor market, those employees quickly find jobs and many never show up on the employment rolls. What appears to be happening now is that many workers who lose their jobs cannot quickly find replacement work and are forced to apply for benefits.Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27, more than ten times the previous record. Through spring and early summer, each subsequent week had seen claims decline. But in late July, the labor market appeared to stall and claims hovered around one million throughout August, a level so high it was never recorded before the pandemic struck. Claims moved down again in September and had made slow, if steady, progress until the election.The elevation of Joe Biden to the presidency and the Senate control of the Senate passing to Democrats may be discouraging hiring. Biden has promised to make raising taxes on businesses a top priority for his administration, which will leave businesses with fewer funds for expanding payrolls or raising wages. As well, many businesses expect a flood of new regulations from the Biden administration, which can also weigh on the labor market. Biden has spent much of the first few weeks of his presidency signing a flurry of executive orders that purport to reverse pro-business policies put in place by his predecessor.New restrictions on businesses aimed at stemming the resurgence of coronavirus are likely contributing to layoffs now. Some states and cities have imposed new curfews and discouraged people from leaving home for non-essential reasons. Businesses faced with this suppressed demand will likely be forced to cut their payrolls to reflect lower sales.There are contrapuntal signs of economic strength. The housing market is booming, pushing up construction spending and homebuilding, and increasing the household wealth of homeowners. Surveys by the Institute for Supply Management of business leaders indicated more growth than expected in both the services and manufacturing sides of the economy.The highest level of unemployment in the country for the week ended January 23 was in Alaska, where 6.4 percent of the workforce is receiving unemployment benefits.

422,"Kroger announced Monday that it will be closing two stores in Long Beach, California — a Ralph’s and a Food 4 Less — after the city council voted to require that large grocery store chains pay workers additional “hero pay” of $4 per hour.Local Fox affiliate KTTV-11 reported:Ralphs and Food 4 Less, both owned by the parent company Kroger, announced Monday that they will be closing 25% of their stores in Long Beach after the city council passed an ordinance requiring companies with over 300 employees nationwide to pay employees an extra $4 per hour.“As a result of the City of Long Beach’s decision to pass an ordinance mandating Extra Pay for grocery workers, we have made the difficult decision to permanently close long-struggling store locations in Long Beach,” said a company spokesperson. “This misguided action by the Long Beach City Council oversteps the traditional bargaining process and applies to some, but not all, grocery workers in the city.”The “hero pay” passed unanimously in January. And Los Angeles passed a similar measure Tuesday, according to National Public Radio:Last month’s Long Beach ordinance has since been emulated by the Los Angeles City Council, which on Tuesday voted to pass a similar measure that requires groceries to pay an additional $5 per hour to their non-managerial employees. The council went one step further and included drug retail stores along with the grocery stores. It passed with unanimous consent Tuesday.Labor unions have backed the “hero pay” for grocery store workers, who are among those considered “essential” workers, and who have kept shelves stocked for nearly a year despite the continued risk associated with the coronavirus pandemic.Workers, unions, and local leaders staged a protest Wednesday, demanding that Kroger reverse its “evil” decision to close the stores (which will be effective in April).However, grocery stores often operate on small margins. Ironically, the effort to reward workers may result in more closures — leading to an increase in so-called “food deserts,” urban areas without ready access to fruits and vegetables.Joel B.

423,"Congressional Democrats on Thursday once again introduced a bill to establish $1,000 “baby bonds” for newborn Americans.“Under the bill, which is being led by Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), anyone born after Dec. 31, 2021, have a government-run ‘American Opportunity Account’ with $1,000 set up for them when they’re born,” Forbes reported.The accounts will accrue about three percent interest and the government would deposit up to $2,000 in those accounts every year until the person turns 18.“The amount deposited depends on the household’s income level, and families will not receive any additional funds if they make more than 500% of the poverty line, which, in 2020, would be approximately $131,000 for a family of four,” the article continued.Individuals could begin taking money from their account when they turn 18 so they could spend it on things such as college, a down payment on a home, or starting a small business, according to Fox Business:The measure — which floundered in the last Congress with just one co-sponsor in the Senate — has garnered 15 Senate co-sponsors so far, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Democrats have a monopoly on power in Washington for the first time in more than a decade, although it’s unclear where the Biden administration stands on the issue of “baby bonds.”In a tweet on January 14, Booker said, “I’m hoping @JoeBiden will include Baby Bonds in the next economic recovery package.”“By investing in our children, we can build our economy back better while largely closing the racial wealth gap. Proud to be leading the charge on this with @AyannaPressley”:I'm hoping @JoeBiden will include Baby Bonds in the next economic recovery package.

Proud to be leading the charge on this with @AyannaPressley.https://t.co/VtpTYROlmU— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) January 14, 2021However, several of his followers disagreed with the idea.“I assume this will be tax-payer funded, so it begs the question: Exactly how much of someone else’s money is it that you think the federal govt is entitled to?? I mean, do you even care about the crippling debt you’re dumping on future generations?” one person replied.“You definitely do not have a clue how the economy works. You are planning to give away my money with pomp like you bestow your own money,” another commented.Others demanded the $2,000 stimulus checks Biden promised while campaigning during the Georgia Senate runoffs.“Cory tell him it needs to be a full 2k check.

424,"Mexico has stopped accepting the return of most migrants caught at the U.S. border, prompting U.S. officials to release them into the United States, according to the Washington Post.The newspaper reported Wednesday:The Mexican government has stopped taking back Central American families “expelled” at the U.S. border under a Trump-era emergency health order related to the coronavirus, a shift that has prompted U.S. Customs and Border Protection to release more parents and children into the U.S. interior, according to five U.S. officials.[…]Mexico’s new policy has been applied unevenly. In Nogales, for example, families continued to be returned to Mexico — deposited on the streets rather than taken to family shelters. In a number of border cities, families continue to be returned to Mexico.The newspaper posted a statement from the Customs and Border Protection Agency:CBP has seen a steady increase in border encounters since April 2020, which, aggravated by COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing guidelines, has caused some facilities to reach maximum, safe holding capacity. Whenever feasible we are seeking alternatives to detention in cases where the law allows.However, Mexico is accepting the return of single adults, the Post said.Biden’s decision to restart the catch and release of migrants during the epidemic will likely encourage many more poor migrants to take the risky trek to jobs in the United States. The exodus will further damage their home countries’ economies and then flood into the U.S. job market, even as millions of blue-collar Americans seek jobs amid the coronavirus recovery.Until recently, Mexico was cooperating with the agencies’ block on the arrival of migrants amid the Coronaviru epidemic. The rule, dubbed Title 42, allowed border agencies to block almost 200,000 migrants and end them back into Mexico, despite the migrants’ attempt to claim asylum.Foreign Affairs magazine reported February 1:Mexico’s president is spoiling for a fight, and Washington must not wait for risks to become inevitabilities that could imperil containment of the pandemic and recovery from the disruption it has wrought.[…][President Andrés ] López Obrador does not fear Biden the way he feared Trump. And so a politically calculated discourse of national sovereignty and anti-Americanism is again more useful than costly. With it, López Obrador can rally his base in advance of the midterm elections in July 2021, when 15 governorships and control of Congress will be at stake. He can make Biden a foil and a distraction from Mexico’s deep economic recession and the ravages of COVID-19.The U.S. border agencies do not appear to be detaining any of the mothers, teenagers, and children or prosecuting them for illegal migration. Instead, they are being released to join their illegal-alien spouses and fathers throughout the United States. This reunification will reduce pressure on illegal migrants to leave the United States. Many of the teenagers are expected to take jobs in the growing child-labor market.The return of catch and release is driven by Biden’s campaign promises, which denounced the policy of filing criminal charges against migrants who brought children as they broke U.S. border laws. The criminal charges required the temporary operation of people from their children, who were kept in child shelters while the adults were held in jails.  On February 2, Biden signed an Executive Order that creates the new “Family Unification” directive:Section 1.  Policy.  It is the policy of my Administration to respect and value the integrity of families seeking to enter the United States. … My Administration will protect family unity and ensure that children entering the United States are not separated from their families, except in the most extreme circumstances where a separation is clearly necessary for the safety and well-being of the child or is required by law.Pro-migration groups along the border welcome the renewed migration:  Team Brownsville, a group that helps migrants move north, reported on its Facebook page.There’s nothing that escapes people’s notice in the {Mexican migrant] camp in this time of connectivity, and they already know that CBP is releasing some families at our Brownsville bus station. We don’t know the specifics of why there is an increase in people leaving CBP custody to travel to their sponsors, but we have received about 50 people a day at our bus station for the past several days.Some of the migrants are so poor they will need further aid when they arrive at their target cities and towns, the Brownsville group reported:Volunteers will eventually be needed countrywide to receive these families, orient them, and help them adjust to their new homes. Too often, we’ve gotten desperate calls from families who have arrived at their sponsor’s home only to realize that there is no room, not enough money to feed everyone, and no resources to help.The economic migration into Americans’ jobs is expected to grow rapidly as coyotes escort more fee-paying migrants through the emerging “family unification” policy loophole in U.S. border laws.Roughly half of the 3.5 million migrants who arrived between 2014 and 2020 are still in the United States, according to a December report by the Department of Homeland Security.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the hiring of temporary contract workers into the jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, priority-driven, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and immigration in theory.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.Joe Biden's EOs on migration show the Democrats want to import poor (IOW, gov't dependent) migrants & they care little about the resulting damage to the sending countries.

425,"The U.S. economy added 49,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate dipped to 6.3 percent, according to data released Friday.Economists surveyed by Econoday had forecast an addition of 50,000 jobs and a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 6.8 percent.The estimate for December was revised down significantly, from a loss of 140,000 to a loss of 227,000. This is the third straight month of sluggishness in the labor market.Job gains in professional and business services and in both public and private education were offset by losses in leisure and hospitality, in retail trade, in health care, and in transportation and warehousing.Private sector employment grew by just 6,000. Manufacturing employment shrank by 10,000, much worse than the predicted gain of 30,000. Retail trade employment shrank by 37,800 after expanding by 134,900 in December.The economy added around 12 million jobs in the second half of 2020, a record-breaking pace after the unprecedented collapse in employment as lockdowns took hold in March and April. The increase in the ranks of employed workers shows that companies ramped up hiring as the economy reopened and consumers came back to stores, restaurants, and other businesses that had been shuttered this spring. Despite the gains, total employment in December was lower than its February level, highlighting just how deep the pandemic cut into what had been the strongest jobs markets in decades.Hiring slowed in November and layoffs picked back up as infections, hospitalizations, and deaths surged. December saw the first negative print for payrolls since the spring. Many state and local governments around the country announced new restrictions on business, travel, dining, and other activities that have once again suppressed demand and discouraged growth in employment. Some businesses that held on through the first wave of shutdowns have not been able to stay in business in the second wave and much of the government aid made available earlier last year was no longer offered in December.And even throughout the reopening layoffs have been extremely elevated, indicating that the pandemic’s effects are still ravaging the economy. A separate report on Thursday showed that 779,000 Americans applied for unemployment benefits in the prior week.EconomyJobsunemployment.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
426,"President Joe Biden’s border deputies are releasing migrant women and children into the United States, according to BorderReport.com.Most of the catch-and-release migrants are likely heading north to meet their husbands and fathers who have already traveled into the United States to take jobs and wages from blue-collar Americans during a deep recession that has largely exempted white-collar workers. Many of the American blue-collars who lose jobs and wages to the extra supply of foreign labor voted for Biden in 2020.BorderReports.com reported February 3:McAllen Mayor Jim Darling on Tuesday told Border Report that city officials met with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, who told them last week that family units — undocumented migrants traveling with children who cross into South Texas — are now being paroled into the United States as they await their asylum proceedings. This is what occurred during previous border security apprehensions known as “catch and release,” when migrants were allowed to remain in the United States during their immigration proceedings however many years that may take.Team Brownsville, a group that helps migrants move north, reported on its Facebook page.There’s nothing that escapes people’s notice in the {Mexican migrant] camp in this time of connectivity, and they already know that CBP is releasing some families at our Brownsville bus station. We don’t know the specifics of why there is an increase in people leaving CBP custody to travel to their sponsors, but we have received about 50 people a day at our bus station for the past several days.The relaunch of catch-and-release comes as Biden and his university-credentialled progressive deputies impose a “family unification” priority on the nation’s immigration laws, which were originally created to preserve Americans’ civil right to a national labor market.The Biden priority exploits the asylum laws that were intended to help a small number of foreign people into the United States claim asylum.Under President Barack Obama, the asylum inflow was expanded to allow people with little evidence or with claims unrelated to government persecution. The rising inflow caused massive delays in court processing, so prompting agencies to release many migrants to the U.S. labor market years before their asylum claims could be heard. In turn, the catch and release process allowed many migrants to finance their trip to the United States with home-country mortgages on farms and homes while being confident they could repay the loan with dollars earned in U.S. jobs.President Donald Trump told his deputies to end the catch and release process, causing a sudden crash in migration numbers by early 2020.However, Biden is signaling to his progressive deputies that he wants migrants to be released into the United States where they can field jobs while they wait for a day in asylum court. Biden is also removing Trump rules that bar the immigration of poor migrants.Darling said that adult migrants traveling with children who were apprehended illegally crossing the Rio Grande into South Texas were being released by U.S. Border Patrol agents at the bus station in downtown McAllen. After release, city officials are immediately taking the migrants across the street to the Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley’s Humanitarian Respite Center, where they are receiving a free COVID-19 test. Once cleared by the tests, the migrants are boarding buses bound for cities elsewhere with the promise of appearing for scheduled U.S. immigration court hearings.“They are doing [disease] testing at the Respite Center before they get on buses,” Darling said. “We also have reached out to Greyhound and are working to get more buses because we expect a jump in numbers.”We are stocking the bus station with backs packs with a pillow, blanket, toiletries, and a snack bag for the cross country trip. It’s like deja vu pre- MPP, but we can’t go into the bus station as we did before and give assistance with the bus changes. Local volunteers are dropping off supplies and occasionally shuttling people to hotels or the airport, with masks and hand sanitizer all around.Some of the migrants are so poor they will need further aid when they arrive at their target cities and towns, the Brownsville group reported:Volunteers will eventually be needed countrywide to receive these families, orient them, and help them adjust to their new homes. Too often, we’ve gotten desperate calls from families who have arrived at their sponsor’s home only to realize that there is no room, not enough money to feed everyone, and no resources to help.Darling did not respond to emails from Breitbart News.Biden officials are also preparing a new reception center for younger migrants who claim the legal status of “Unaccompanied Alien Children.” Many of the young migrants hope to join parents or relatives in the United States, often to take jobs in the growing child labor workforce.The economic migration into Americans’ jobs is expected to grow rapidly as coyotes escort more fee-paying migrants through the emerging “family unification” policy loophole in U.S. border laws. On February 2, Biden signed an Executive Order that creates the new “Family Unification” directive:Section 1.  Policy.  It is the policy of my Administration to respect and value the integrity of families seeking to enter the United States. … My Administration will protect family unity and ensure that children entering the United States are not separated from their families, except in the most extreme circumstances where a separation is clearly necessary for the safety and well-being of the child or is required by law.Roughly half of the 3.5 million migrants who arrived between 2014 and 2020 are still in the United States, according to a December report by the Department of Homeland Security.With migrant-friendly officers at the Democrat-run border, illegal migration routes will remain a de facto obstacle-course immigration system for blue-collar migrants — if they survive the chaotic Hunger Games trail of loans, coyotes, cartels, rape, deserts, weather, border laws, barriers, rescuers, transport, judges, and cheap-labor employers.The government-delivered inflow of migrant’ spouses and children helps to discourage residents illegals from returning home to their families. Their return would cause problems for the many employers that prefer to hire compliant migrants instead of Americans, but their return would provide jobs and higher wages for Americans. In 2015, President Barack Obama adopted a similar policy for foreign college graduate visa workers. His deputies create work permits for the resident spouses of H-1B workers who are working for years while they wait for their employer to deliver promised green cards. The resulting H4EAD program now keeps perhaps 250,000 spouses of white-collar workers in jobs, mostly in the white-collar job needed by U.S. graduates.For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration — or the hiring of temporary contract workers into the jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, priority-driven, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and immigration in theory.The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.https://twitter.com/NeilMunroDC/status/1356976507487420420?s=20EconomyImmigrationPoliticsasylumcatch and releaseDiplacementfamily reunificationFamily Unit Aliensillegal migrationunaccompanied alien childrenwages.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
427,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen consulted ethics lawyers before calling a meeting with the government’s top financial regulators to discuss the GameStop stock trading frenzy, according to a report from Reuters.Yellen’s sought an ethics waiver after media reports pointed out that she received $700,0000 in speaking fees from Citadel, LLC.  Yellen has said she would not act in an official capacity in matters involving the firm without receiving a written waiver from Treasury ethics officials.Citadel, alongside another fund, extended a $2.75 billion bailout to hedge fund Melvin Capital Management. Melvin had suffered billions in losses because of its bet against GameStop. Robinhood, the app-based broker that sparked outrage when it restricted trading in so-called meme stocks, is paid by Citadel Securities for privileged access to its users’ trades.Treasury said Wednesday that the meeting would include Yellen and leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.“Secretary Yellen believes the integrity of markets is important and has asked for a discussion of recent volatility in financial markets and whether recent activities are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets,” Treasury spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna said.(An earlier version of this story misspelled Ms. LaManna’s name.) Yellen, the former head of the Federal Reserve, was confirmed by the Senate as President Joe Biden’s treasury chief last month.—UPI contributed to this report.EconomyPoliticsCFTCCitadelFederal ReserveGameStopJanet YellenSECTreasury Department.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
428,"New orders for U.S. manufactured goods showed another solid monthly increase in December, the eighth straight month of rising orders and the latest sign that the U.S. economy is on a stronger footing than previously thought.Factory orders rose 1.1 percent in December, much better than the 0.7 percent rise forecast by economists. The November figure was revised up to show a 1.3 percent rise from the initial estimate of 1 percent.The revision to November means December’s outperformance is even more impressive. Orders rose by more than expected off a higher baseline.The figures come from a monthly report released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.Orders for machinery, also up eight consecutive months, led the increase, rising 2.7 percent to $33.4 billion. New orders for manufactured nondurable goods increased $4.1 billion or 1.7 percent to $247.1 billion.  Durable goods orders rose 0.5 percent to $246.4 billion, beating the earlier estimate of a 0.2 percent gain.But if we focus on consumer goods, the picture is different. Orders for consumer durables rose 2.9 percent in December, while nondurable consumer goods orders rose 2.2 percent. This suggests that consumer demand remains strong despite the pandemic and recent sluggishness in the labor market.Despite the increases, factory orders have still not recovered to prepandemic levels. Compared with a year ago, orders are down 6.6 percent.Orders for non-defense aircraft are down 116 percent and fell 51 percent in December. For the year 2020, this category was actually negative $17 billion because so many orders were canceled.New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding airlines—often considered a proxy for business investment—rose 0.7 percent.Orders for computers and information technology were strong last year, boosted by households, schools, and businesses adjusting to remote operations. Information technology orders ended the year 4 percent above the previous year’s level but were unchanged from November. Orders for computers actually fell in December, declining 3.2 percent, but the full-year figure shows a gain of 6.7 percent compared with a.year ago.  Economydurable goodsfactoriesmanufacturing.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
429,"President Joe Biden sounded a dark note on the future of the economy Friday, after a bleak jobs report came out.The United States economy added 49,000 jobs in December with only 6,000 jobs in the private sector, according to the latest report released Friday morning.“At that rate, it’s going to take ten years to get back to full employment,” Biden said. “That’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact.”The president spoke while meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats in the Oval Office to discuss his $1.9 trillion coronavirus spending plan.“This is about people’s lives, it’s not just about numbers,” he said, noting the rise in mental health cases, drug abuse, and suicides in the United States.Biden thanked Senate Democrats for passing a budget reconciliation bill to move his plan forward with a simple majority.“People are really feeling the hole; they don’t know how to get out,” he said. “You’ve given them a lot of hope.”Biden vowed he would speed the American recovery with the glut of new spending, again explaining why he wanted to err on the side of spending too much rather than too little.“We can fix it.

430,"China began its largest annual political meeting Thursday, an event known as the “Two Sessions” that assembles some 5,000 members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) elite to work out an agenda for the coming year. This year’s meeting is scheduled to produce a new set of draconian rules governing Hong Kong politics that will effectively eliminate political dissent and meaningful democratic choice.The Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) noted the omens for Hong Kong’s autonomy are grim, as the report traditionally published by the Two Sessions meeting literally erased the phrase “high degree of autonomy” from its description of the island’s political system, along with the notion of “Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong” and even the traditional phrase “one country, two systems.”The latter omission will be of keen interest to the people of Taiwan, since “one country, two systems” is also the relationship Beijing has in mind for their island.“The change marks the first time all three fundamental concepts underpinning the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution, have not featured in the annual report. Last year, the phrases ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and ‘autonomy’ were included, while all three remained present in 2019,” the HKFP recalled.“One country, two systems” summed up the agreement reached between the United Kingdom and China when the latter took possession of Hong Kong in 1997. China promised Hong Kong would be allowed to maintain its own laws and legislature, and its people would retain freedoms guaranteed under British law but denied to Chinese citizens.Beijing’s new idea is to replace “Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong” with a new rule stipulating only “patriots” — i.e. Chinese Communist Party loyalists — can participate in government. The Two Sessions report also called for more “patriotic” education for Hong Kong students, who played a prominent role in the 2019 protest movement.NBC News said “Hong Kong’s vanishing freedom” was on the agenda as the CCP’s “rubber-stamp parliament” prepared to assert more direct control over Hong Kong politics, while seeking to preserve some of its valuable economic freedom and avoid frightening away the Westerners who do business there.Aside from that dash of economic freedom, Anthony Kim of the Index of Economic Freedom told NBC that Hong Kong has sadly become “almost indistinguishable, in many respects, from other major Chinese commercial centers.” The Index will therefore begin folding Hong Kong and its sister city Macau into China’s freedom ranking, which is currently floating at 107th out of 178 nations.The UK Guardian observed that even some pro-Beijing politicians in Hong Kong are nervous about the changes Beijing plans to impose on their political system. One of them cautiously advised the CCP congress not to “go too far and kill the patient” when it sets about “improving” the Hong Kong system.China’s state-run Global Times naturally took a much sunnier view of the Two Sessions gathering, reporting that “thousands of deputies and members arrived in Beijing with palpable elation,” ready to “review and discuss a number of economic and social issues including setting growth targets, budget, Hong Kong-related reforms, as well as mapping out blueprint for the country’s social and economic development for the next 5-15 years.”“Top Chinese policymakers are also expected to review and discuss major policy initiatives in the face of growing external challenges with rising anti-China sentiment in some Western countries while making deep reflection on how to maximize the advantages of China’s governance system and socialist democracy in a turbulent environment,” the Global Times added.AsiaNational SecurityChinademocracyHong KongNational People's Congressone country two systems.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
431,"Beijing public health workers are the least willing to receive a Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine candidate compared to their counterparts elsewhere in China, a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed this week.The study’s research team, led by China CDC program leader Kong Qingfu, published its findings through the Chinese Journal of Vaccines and Immunization on March 2. The CDC’s National Immunization Program researchers, who conducted the survey, “concluded that the higher the education level of staff, the less willing they were to get the jab.”Less than 74 percent of all CDC staff in Beijing, China’s national capital, would receive a Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine candidate voluntarily, according to the study.Outside of the capital, in provinces such as Shandong, Sichuan, and Hubei — the epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak in late 2019 — nearly 90 percent of public health staff said they would voluntarily get a coronavirus vaccine candidate manufactured in China.Over 3,000 public health workers across China participated in the survey from May to June of last year. The study’s researchers noted Tuesday that the results of the poll “should be treated with caution since about a third of CDC employees did not respond.”“CDC staff are a key target population for Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccination due to their high risk of infection,” Kong, the research team’s leader, wrote in the report.The survey’s researchers said it was not clear why public health workers in Beijing were the least willing to be vaccinated against the Chinese coronavirus. They suggested medical staff in Beijing “perhaps felt they were less at risk than their colleagues elsewhere” due to the city’s premier status as China’s national capital and political center which ostensibly affords Beijing greater priority for state-funded pandemic control measures.Beijing has seen some of the strictest coronavirus lockdowns in China over the past year and especially over the last several weeks due to a recent surge of cases in the city and its surrounding province, Hebei, starting in early January. Chinese health authorities locked down 1.7 million residents of southern Beijing’s Daxing district on January 19 to prevent new, locally detected coronavirus cases from spreading across the city’s population of nearly 22 million people.“Daxing district in southern Beijing … has been sealed off from the rest of the country after six infections were found there. The total number of cases in Beijing stands at 15,” Bloomberg News reported at the time.Daxing’s government banned all 1.7 million residents of the district from leaving Beijing “unless they have received special permission from the authorities” and tested negative for coronavirus in the past three days.“Residents from five Daxing apartment complexes have been barred from leaving their homes from Wednesday [January 20],” Bloomberg reported, citing district government officials.Daxing also shut down all kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools and ordered students to study from home. The district prohibited gatherings of 50 or more people, instructing that “weddings should be postponed and funerals simplified,” Agence France-Presse reported of the strict measures.AsiaHealthNational SecurityBeijingCDCChinaCoronavirus vaccinevaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
432,"The Philippine government on Wednesday urged Filipinos to choose the Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine candidate CoronaVac, admitting that the public’s significant lack of enthusiasm toward the “Made in China” product has caused many to shun the shot.“That’s what I’m saying to our countrymen, that we shouldn’t be brand-conscious. All vaccines have their own [percentage] of efficacy,” Philippine Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez, Jr., said in an interview with the Filipino news program Headstart on March 3.China’s state-run pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech produced Coronavac, a Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate. Full efficacy data released in January found CoronaVac to be just 50.38 percent effective against the Chinese coronavirus. The Philippine government has repeatedly encouraged Filipinos to receive CoronaVac, which it has included in its national coronavirus vaccine drive, despite its low efficacy rate.“[Q]uite a number of [Philippine] medical workers have rejected CoronaVac, saying that they prefer to wait for other vaccine brands, such as the ones made by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, because they have higher efficacy rates,” Coconuts Manila reported on Wednesday.“As a consequence, even Filipinos who do not work in healthcare are wary of taking Sinovac [CoronaVac],” according to the news site.The Philippines Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CoronaVac for emergency use in the country on February 22.Late-stage trial data of CoronaVac suggested it had “a lower efficacy when used for healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] compared with healthy individuals age 18-59,” Philippine FDA chief Rolando Enrique Domingo said at the time.“According to our experts, (Sinovac’s) vaccine is not the best vaccine for them,” Domingo said at a February 22 press briefing, referring to the Philippines’ 1.4 million healthcare workers.“The [CoronaVac] vaccine is recommended to be administered only to healthy individuals 18 to 59 years old, but not to senior citizens and medical frontliners,” the Philippine FDA said.Sinovac Biotech agreed to donate 600,000 CoronaVac doses to the Philippines, which is home to over 108 million people and currently has the second-highest coronavirus caseload in Southeast Asia. The first batch of CoronaVac doses arrived in Manila on February 28 and the Philippine government launched a national coronavirus vaccine campaign two days later on March 2.CoronaVac is the third Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate approved for emergency use in the Philippines. Manila has contracted to receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNtech’s COVAX, distributed by the World Health Organization to poorer nations, as well as the option developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Oxford University.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinaCoronavacCoronavirus vaccinehealthPhilippinesvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
433,"The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday attacked a group of 26 scientists who published a letter condemning the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) and the Chinese Communist Party for making a true scientific investigation into the origins of the Chinese coronavirus impossible.The letter demanded China allow a team of W.H.O. full intellectual freedom in exploring key sites in Wuhan, the city where the Chinese coronavirus originated, and access to all necessary data on coronavirus cases in early 2020. A team of W.H.O. public health investigators traveled to Wuhan in February to seek evidence to answer where the virus came from and how it managed to spread among humans so quickly in late 2019. The team was forced into a two-week quarantine before touring areas like the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and the Huanan Seafood Market, to which the first coronavirus cases were reportedly linked. Chinese government investigators accompanied the W.H.O. team throughout the probe and the Communist Party refused to hand over raw data on coronavirus cases in the city, compromising the team’s work.Chinese officials admitted to destroying key evidence during the first days of the pandemic, claiming it necessary to “disinfect” the Huanan market and other locations and to destroy early samples of the Chinese coronavirus to prevent further infections. The decision has made it difficult for scientists to track the virus’s evolution during the early days of the pandemic.The W.H.O. announced Thursday that it would no longer publish a report detailing preliminary findings from the report, as it had been scheduled to do within the next week. Officials insisted scientists would publish the full report.Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin took care on Friday not to directly attack the World Health Organization — which has been overwhelmingly favorable to Beijing in its handling of the pandemic — but instead to direct his ire towards the 26 scientists who drafted a letter demanding the Chinese government allow a proper investigation in the country.“In disregard of scientific facts, some people have politicized the issue of origin-tracing, misinterpreted the scientific conclusion and report of the joint mission, and kept instigating an investigation with presumption of guilt against specific country,” Wang told reporters during the daily Foreign Ministry briefing on Friday, referring to China. “Such behavior is not conducive to international anti-epidemic cooperation.”“These signatories can deceive no one, including themselves, as to whether their so-called ‘open letter of scientists’ is a true proposal for scientific and professional origin-tracing or pursuit of political agenda with presumption of guilt,” Wang railed.Wang defended the investigation by claiming all the members of the W.H.O. investigative team — not the Chinese Communist Party scientists Beijing forced them to cooperate with — were chosen exclusively by the W.H.O. with no input from China, which does not address scientists’ concerns about the Beijing team. The handpicked Communist Party team, he insisted, showed that China was serious about aiding the investigation.China, Wang said, “arranged top Chinese experts in relevant fields to take part, and assembled a large number of technical personnel to support the joint mission in collecting data and documents.”Wang concluded by demanding the W.H.O. organizing missions to other countries to find the true origin of the Chinese coronavirus: “since there have been more reports worldwide on the coronavirus appearing in various places around the world in the latter half of 2019, it is getting increasingly urgent and necessary to conduct similar visits to other countries and regions.”In reality, no evidence exists of any coronavirus cases surfacing anywhere in the world before November 17, 2019, the date that Wuhan health workers confirmed the first Chinese coronavirus case, according to leaked Chinese government documents. Beijing does not recognize these documents as legitimate and instead claims that reports of the virus appearing elsewhere in November of that year negates the evidence in Wuhan. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have repeatedly accused the United States of causing the pandemic and Maryland of being the true origin of the virus, without evidence.The offending open letter, signed by 26 scientists, surfaced in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, which first reported that the W.H.O. was canceling plans to publish a preliminary report on the Wuhan investigation in part because the scientists did not gather sufficient data there to draw significant conclusions. The letter condemns the Chinese Communist Party specifically for hindering the scientific process to trace the origins of the Chinese coronavirus.“[T]he joint team did not have the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation into all the relevant SARS-CoV-2 [Chinese coronavirus] origin hypotheses — whether natural spillover or laboratory/research-related incident,” the scientists wrote in their letter, acknowledging the existence of theories that the virus did not originate in nature, but in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which at the time was known to be conducting research on coronaviruses.The scientists expressed particular concern with the fact that the W.H.O. team appeared handicapped by the existence of a parallel Chinese regime team “made of Chinese citizens whose scientific independence may be limited.”“[I]nternational members of the joint team had to rely on information the Chinese authorities chose to share with them, and … any joint team report must be approved by both the Chinese and international members of the joint team,” the scientists noted. They went on to criticize the lack of screening for “conflict of interest” even among the W.H.O. team members and the lack of access to “granular lab records, data, and personnel to an extent that would allow them to confidently evaluate the various hypotheses.”Beijing also imposed a “broad Chinese State Council gag order which prevented any spontaneous sharing of any information about the pandemic, and which coordinated the careful release of any such information with the Chinese government,” the scientists highlighted.The letter concluded calling for the dismissal of the current operation and an entirely new, and objective, investigation into the origins of the Chinese coronavirus.W.H.O. officials have openly admitted that its investigations in Wuhan have yielded little to no usable evidence.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacommunismcoronavirusscienceWall Street JournalWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
434,"A representative of the leftist dictatorship of Belarus presented a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday in defense of the Chinese Communist Party’s erosion of civil rights in Hong Kong, allegedly signed by 70 other U.N. member nations.China’s state media apparatus effusively celebrated the letter as the support of the entire world behind its policies to crush Hong Kong’s traditional autonomy, protected under a policy known as “One Country, Two Systems.” Beijing agreed to the policy — which bans Hong Kong from seeking sovereignty, and Beijing from imposing communism in the city — when the United Kingdom handed the port city over to China in 1997.In the past two years, the Chinese Communist Party has implemented increasingly repressive measures to eliminate capitalist democracy, prompting city-wide protests attracting millions of people. After the Beijing-controlled local government failed to pass a law in 2019 that would allow the extradition of anyone present in Hong Kong to China if charged with a violation of communist law, the Beijing National People’s Congress (NPC) passed a law last year that punished four “crimes” with a minimum of ten years in prison: “terrorism,” “secession,” “calls for foreign interference,” and “subversion of state power.”Dozens of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists have been arrested under the so-called “national security” law, including most prominent organizers of protests. This week, with the NPC back in session, Beijing will seek to implement new laws that ban those not deemed “patriots” by the Communist Party from holding public office in Hong Kong.In this context, the government of Belarus — itself engulfed in popular pro-democracy protests — presented a letter to the Human Rights Council on behalf of 70 countries, which Chinese coverage of the letter did not identify, supporting China’s repression of the people of Hong Kong. Belarus is not a member of the Human Rights Council but China — and rogue state allies like Russia, Cuba, and Venezuela — do enjoy seats in the venue. The U.N. Human Rights Council’s nominal purpose is to defend international human rights, a purpose critics say has been lost as a growing number of human rights violators earn seats on the Council.“We support China’s implementation of ‘one country, two systems’ in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,” the letter read, referring to China’s policies contradicting the “One Country, Two Systems” policy. “Since the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region came into force, Hong Kong has got rid of turbulence and gradually restored stability.”“The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is an inalienable part of China, and Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal affairs that brook no interference by any external forces. We urge the relevant sides to respect China’s sovereignty and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs as well as China’s internal affairs,” the letter concluded.China’s state-run Global Times propaganda newspaper noted Friday that the NPC, currently open for lawmaking as part of China’s annual “Two Sessions,” is working on a “detailed draft decision to overhaul the Hong Kong electoral system with the aim of fixing existing loopholes.” The law, it continued, would “effectively implement the political principle of only patriots governing the city,” meaning politicians loyal to Beijing.The Chinese Foreign Ministry applauded the letter by calling “crystal-clear” proof that its repression of Hong Kong citizens was politically healthy for the city.“China is determined in safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, in implementing “one country, two systems,” and in upholding prosperity and stability in Hong Kong,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said during Friday’s press briefing. “We urge the relevant parties to strictly observe international law and basic norms governing international relations, and stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs in any way.”The letter is the second of its kind to the U.N. In July 2020, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, Afghanistan, and other repressive states similarly pressured the U.N. Human Rights Council with a joint statement in defense of the “national security law” passed to criminalize pro-democracy protests. Chinese allies in the Human Rights Council have similarly defended Beijing’s genocide campaign against Uyghur people in western Xinjiang, where the Communist Party has built hundreds of concentration camps to eliminate the ethnic minority group.On the Council, China has used its position to divert attention away from growing concerns about its genocide by accusing the United States — which left the council under President Donald Trump but has requested to return under President Joe Biden — of various alleged human rights abuses. At a Council meeting in November, China’s envoy decried alleged “systematic racism” in the United States, citing it as a distinctly egregious human rights abuse in the world, and used his speech time to urge Washington to “root out systematic racism, address widespread police brutality and combat discrimination against African- and Asian-Americans.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinaHong Konghuman rightsU.N.

435,"Russian authorities opened a criminal case this week against five Jehovah’s Witnesses on suspicion of “organizing and participating in the activities of an extremist organization” for allegedly promoting their namesake religious group, which is officially outlawed as an “extremist ideology” in Russia.Russia’s Investigative Committee, its main federal investigating body, announced the criminal case in a statement issued March 4.Five residents of the city of Syktyvkar, in Russia’s northwestern Komi Republic, allegedly “carried out active organizational actions aimed at continuation of the organization’s illegal activities and the involvement of new participants in it” over a four-year period between 2017 and 2021.“In particular, acting in secrecy, they carried out general management of the organization’s activities, coordinated illegal activities, organized and held meetings of members of a banned organization, and collected funds to finance the activities of a banned extremist organization,” according to the statement.A Syktyvkar court has ordered that one suspect in the case be placed in pretrial detention. Russian federal authorities have placed two others accused in the case under house arrest and prohibited an additional two suspects from leaving Syktyvkar pending an ongoing investigation into the illegal activity.“In the criminal case, searches were carried out at the places of residence of the defendants and other alleged members of the banned organization. More than 10 persons were questioned as witnesses,” Russia’s Investigative Committee revealed on Thursday.The statement confirmed earlier reports by Jehovah’s Witnesses in Syktyvkar that “police searched at least 14 homes of members of their congregation” on March 3.Russia’s Supreme Court designated the Jehovah’s Witnesses group an illegal extremist organization in 2017 after the Russian justice ministry accused the organization of distributing “extremist” pamphlets that incited hatred against other groups.One such Jehovah’s Witnesses pamphlet allegedly quoted the Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy “describing the doctrine of the Russian Orthodox Church as superstition and sorcery,” according to the Russian Ministry of Justice.Moscow has cracked down on Jehovah’s Witnesses since banning the organization in 2017, detaining and imprisoning dozens of the group’s members for practicing the now-illegal religion. Many observers accuse the Russian government of unfairly targeting the group because it opposes the dominant Russian Orthodox Church championed by the Kremlin.Established in the U.S. in the 19th century, the Jehovah’s Witnesses group is known by many for sharing its message door-to-door. The Jehovah’s Witnesses movement is not considered a mainstream Christian denomination by traditional Christian churches “because it rejects the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, which it regards as both irrational and unbiblical,” according to the BBC.Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia found guilty of promoting the religion face up to ten years in prison based on its designation as an “extremist” group. A court in Russia’s Republic of Khakassia, located in eastern Siberia, sentenced two local Jehovah’s Witnesses to two and six years in prison respectively in February for “organizing an extremist group.”AsiaFaithNational SecurityChristian persecutionJehovah’s WitnessesRussia.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
436,"Australian state broadcaster SBS will stop airing content from two Chinese state news outlets on Friday after a human rights group accused SBS of airing forced prisoner confessions filmed by the Chinese outlets.Safeguard Defenders, an Asian human rights group, contacted SBS on Thursday and alleged China Global Television Network (CGTN) and China Central Television (CCTV) have broadcast on SBS “at least 56 confessions of prisoners held under duress or torture between 2013 and 2020.”“SBS has received a complaint which it is currently reviewing,” a spokesperson for the Australian tax-payer funded media outlet said on March 4.“Given the serious concerns it raises, and the complexity of the material involved, we have made the decision to suspend the broadcast of the overseas-sourced CGTN and CCTV news bulletins while we undertake an assessment of these services,” the spokesperson added.SBS has aired 15 minutes of CGTN in Mandarin and 30 minutes of CCTV in English as part of its “World Watch” international news program for years with a disclaimer that the programs “may not reflect SBS standards and may contain distressing material.”Safeguard Defenders successfully lobbied the British TV regulator Ofcom to strip CGTN of its local broadcast license on February 4 after finding that CGTN is “ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.”Ofcom concluded that Star China Media Limited (SCML), the license-holder for CGTN service, “did not have editorial responsibility for CGTN’s output. As such, SCML does not meet the legal requirement of having control over the licensed service, and so is not a lawful broadcast licensee.”“[W]e consider that CGTNC would be disqualified from holding a license, as it is controlled by a body which is ultimately controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” the British regulator added.There is no equivalent license to revoke in Australia, however. “Instead, it is up to the discretion of SBS as to what it broadcasts,” the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) noted on Friday.One week after Ofcom revoked CGTN’s U.K. broadcast license, Chinese government officials banned broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)’s World News within China and Hong Kong on February 12.China’s National Radio and Television Administration claimed BBC World News reports on China had “seriously violated” a requirement to be “truthful and fair,” harmed Chinese interests, and undermined China’s national unity.The publicly-funded Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) announced it would no longer air BBC radio news programming as it had done for years in the former British colony.AsiaMediaNational SecurityAustraliaChina.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
437,"The health of Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan is “deteriorating” from a prolonged hunger strike she started months ago while in jail to protest a four-year prison term handed to her by Chinese state authorities in December for her reporting on Wuhan’s initial coronavirus outbreak last year.“She has been on hunger strike and force-fed through nasal tubes with her limbs restrained for long periods,” a lawyer for Zhang who asked not to be identified told Agence France-Presse (AFP) of his client this week.Zhang, a 37-year-old woman from Shanghai, China, “had become very thin and almost unrecognizable by Christmas [December 2020],” according to the lawyer, who added that Zhang appeared in court that month in a wheelchair due to her frail health.“By not eating, she wants to protest against the illegal nature of her treatment,” Zhang Keke, another member of Zhang Zhan’s legal team told AFP.“She believes that not eating is a way to tell them [Chinese authorities] they are wrong,” Keke said.Keke previously issued a statement saying that when he visited Zhang in jail in early December 2020 she told him she was being force-fed via a feeding tube and was suffering from stomach pain, dizziness, and headaches.“Restrained 24 hours a day, she needs assistance going to the bathroom, and she tosses and turns in her sleep,” the lawyer said in a statement shared by the BBC.“She feels psychologically exhausted, like every day is a torment,” Keke added.Zhang traveled from Shanghai to the central Chinese city of Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the local coronavirus outbreak there, which was the epicenter of China’s coronavirus epidemic in late 2019. Zhang filmed coronavirus patients lining the halls of Wuhan hospitals and published the footage, along with open letters critical of Wuhan’s alleged attempts to cover up the then-unfolding health crisis, online. Her amateur reporting soon caught the attention of Chinese state authorities, who arrested and detained Zhang in Shanghai in May 2020.The Shanghai Pudong New Area People’s Court sentenced Zhang to four years in prison on December 28, 2020, for “picking quarrels and stirring up trouble,” which is considered a crime in China under the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The party regularly uses the vague catchall to jail Chinese political dissidents.“According to credible sources, Ms Zhang has been subject to torture and ill-treatment during her detention and her health condition has seriously deteriorated. It is crucial that she receives adequate medical assistance,” a spokesperson for the European Union (E.U.) said on December 29 in a statement calling for Zhang’s immediate release.The U.S. government joined the E.U. in campaigning for Zhang’s release late last year.“The United States strongly condemns the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) sham prosecution and conviction of citizen journalist Zhang Zhan on December 28,” then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on December 29.“We call on the PRC government to release her immediately and unconditionally,” he added.AsiaCrimeNational SecurityChinacitizen journalismCitizen Journalistcoronavirushunger strikeShanghaiWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
438,"A man in northern India’s Uttar Pradesh state was arrested Wednesday after locals spotted him walking calmly down a village street with his daughter’s severed head in hand.Sarvesh Kumar, 45, admitted to police he decapitated his 17-year-old daughter with a sword after finding her in “an objectionable” position with her boyfriend on March 3.“This is my daughter’s head. I cut her off. I couldn’t find anything, else I would have killed both of them. I saw her. I have done it with a sharp tool. … Her body is lying in the room,” Kumar is heard saying in a video clip of his initial interrogation by police deployed to the scene on a Pandetara village street.The suspect is seen holding his daughter’s severed head as he speaks to police officers in the now-viral video clip. The police are heard in the clip asking Kumar to place the head down on the ground and sit by the side of the road, which he does without protest. The officers later brought Kumar to a local police station and arrested him.“A person named Sarvesh killed his teenaged daughter and was spotted carrying her severed head on the road. We intercepted him as soon as we received information about it and have taken him into custody,” local police official Kapil Deo Sing told NDTV reporters.“We have also taken serious note of a photo which shows a police official carrying her head inappropriately. The cop has been suspended,” Sing added.“The accused is being interrogated, and we will soon present him before a magistrate,” a local police officer said, adding that authorities have ordered a post-mortem examination of the victim’s body.Pandetara village is located about 120 miles southeast of the Uttar Pradesh state capital of Lucknow.

439,"More than 5,200 people had signed a petition on Wednesday demanding Indian Supreme Court Judge Sharad Arvind Bobde resign after he recently suggested that an accused rapist marry his schoolgirl victim to avoid jail time.“If you want to marry (her), we can help you. If not, you lose your job and go to jail,” Bobde told an Indian government technician at a court hearing on March 1.Judge Bobde made the suggestion to a man who petitioned against arrest after being “accused of stalking, tying up, gagging, repeatedly raping a minor school-going girl, and threatening to douse her in petrol and set her alight, to hurl acid at her, and to have her brother killed,” according to the Hindu. The alleged crimes reportedly drove the minor victim to attempt suicide.Chief Justice of India (CJI) Bobde’s remarks on Monday were met with indignation by a coalition of womens’ rights groups in India, who started a petition calling for his resignation this week.“By suggesting that this rapist marry the victim-survivor, you, the Chief Justice of India, sought to condemn the victim-survivor to a lifetime of rape at the hands of the tormentor who drove her to attempt suicide,” a letter included in the petition read.“From the towering heights of the post of CJI of the Supreme Court, it sends the message to other courts, judges, police, and all other law enforcing agencies that justice is not a constitutional right of women in India,” the letter further read.“This will only lead to the further silencing of girls and women. To the rapists, it sends the message that marriage is a license to rape; and that by obtaining such a license, the rapist can post facto decriminalize or legalize his act,” the letter’s authors added.Nearly 50 Indian women’s rights groups signed the letter, including the All India Progressive Women’s Association, the National Federation of Indian Women, and India’s Forum Against Oppression of Women.Indian courts hearing sexual assault cases often propose so-called compromise solutions which encourage accused sexual abusers to marry their alleged victims. Judge Bobde during a separate court hearing on March 1 reportedly questioned if non-consensual sex between a married couple could be considered rape.“The husband may be a brutal man, but can you call the act of sexual intercourse between a lawfully wedded man and wife as rape?” Bobde asked.India is one of the 36 countries in the world where marital rape has not been criminalized. Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) states that “sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.”This follows a series of rapes in India over the past year, including a woman allegedly raped while on an ICU ventilator, a 6 year old girl who died after being allegedly raped by her cousin, and a 19 year old woman whose gang rape and death sparked protests due to police reportedly improperly disposing of her body against her family’s wishes.AsiaCrimeNational SecurityIndiaminorsRape.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
440,"The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Thursday morning reported the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) is scrapping the interim report from a team of investigators who visited Wuhan, China, in early February, under pressure from scientists who said the Chinese government withheld too much data from the investigating team, necessitating a new and more exhaustive investigation into the origins of the coronavirus.The WSJ said W.H.O. made its decision “against a backdrop of continued political and scientific controversy surrounding the search for the origins of the pandemic.”According to W.H.O. administrators and members of the investigating team, a full report about the Wuhan visit will still be published “in the coming weeks” and will include “key findings,” but the interim report promised by W.H.O. director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on February 12 will not be released.An influential group of scientists apparently precipitated this decision by writing an open letter that essentially dismissed the February mission to Wuhan and called for a do-over — a much more thorough investigation that would review data unacceptably withheld by Chinese officials:According to an advance copy of the open letter, the group of 26 scientists and other experts in areas including virology, zoology and microbiology said that it was “all but impossible” for the WHO team to conduct a full investigation, and that any report was likely to involve political compromises as it had to be approved by the Chinese side.A credible investigation required, among other things, confidential interviews and fuller access to hospital records of confirmed and potential Chinese coronavirus cases in late 2019, when the outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, said the letter signed by experts from France, the U.S., India, Australia, and other countries. Investigators should also be allowed to view records including maintenance, personnel, animal breeding and experiment logs from all laboratories working with coronaviruses, the letter said.“We cannot afford an investigation into the origins of the pandemic that is anything less than absolutely thorough and credible,” the letter said. “Efforts to date do not constitute a thorough, credible, and transparent investigation.”The letter specifically rejected the notion, the product of the Wuhan visit, of ruling out China’s virus labs as a possible origin for the coronavirus, stating the W.H.O. team had “insufficient access to adequately investigate” that theory. In fact, the signatories said it remains possible the Chinese coronavirus was the subject of “gain-of-function” genetic manipulation experiments that made it more deadly.The leader of the W.H.O. team, Danish food scientist Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, said after returning from Wuhan that laboratory accidents are “definitely not off the table” as a potential source of the global pandemic.The scientific community, including some participants in the W.H.O. mission to Wuhan, has been fidgeting uncomfortably ever since the team returned. These scientists seemed especially uncomfortable with China’s use of the investigation for propaganda purposes, including confident declarations that W.H.O. has forever exonerated the Chinese government from responsibility for unleashing the Chinese coronavirus. In fact, the CCP has asserted W.H.O.’s research ruled out Wuhan itself as the point of origin for the pandemic, insisting other nations should be investigated as sources of the virus who spread it to China.Scientists around the world have also grown uneasy over China’s refusal to hand over source data for several key aspects of the early coronavirus pandemic to W.H.O. In several instances, Chinese officials presented investigators with analysis prepared by Chinese doctors but refused to let the investigators see the original records or medical samples the analysis was based on.The WSJ noted Beijing is extremely unlikely to authorize a more thorough probe or admit the previous one was inadequate.

441,"The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), a human rights and advocacy organization for the ethnic group, has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC)’s ethics commission chair to review its call for the 2022 Winter Games not to be held in Beijing, China, citing allegations of “crimes against humanity” by China against Uyghurs.Human rights organizations and the U.N. estimate that 1-3 million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities in China’s western region of Xinjiang have been detained in state-run camps since at least 2017 as part of a targeted crackdown on the ethnic minority groups by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The World Uyghur Congress (WUC) wrote IOC ethics chief and former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on February 26, stating that the IOC had “acted in breach of the Olympic Charter by failing to reconsider holding the 2022 Olympics in Beijing following verifiable evidence of genocide and crimes and humanity taking place” in Xinjiang’s Uyghur detention camps.The WUC said its previous public complaint on the issue in August 2020 had not received a fair hearing by the IOC and once again urged Ban Ki-moon to review the statement.“The grievance requests that Mr Ban Ki Moon either examine the Complaint himself or appoint a new Ethics and Compliance Officer to do so properly,” the WUC’s press statement announcing the letter read.Shortly after the WUC released its public complaint to the IOC last August, the body issued a statement to Reuters saying it “must remain neutral on all global political issues.”The IOC further said it had been assured by the Chinese government “that the principles of the Olympic Charter will be respected in the context of the [2022 Winter] Games.”The CCP officially denies the existence of detention camps in Xinjiang, though it does acknowledge placing Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities in state-run facilities since 2017; the Communist Party refers to the camps as “vocational” or “political education” centers. Beijing claims that the camps are designed to direct Uyghurs — a Turkic-speaking, Sunni Muslim minority group — into the Chinese labor force and away from alleged Islamic extremism and terrorism within Xinjiang, China’s westernmost territory. The region borders Central Asia and is referred to by Uyghurs as “East Turkestan.”Uyghur survivors of Xinjiang’s camps and former employees of the facilities have testified to witnessing guards use “systematic” rape and sexual abuse as a form of torture against detainees. In addition, some have alleged that they experienced or witnessed forced sterilizations and abortions, slave labor conditions, and Communist political indoctrination.AsiaNational SecuritySportsBan Ki-MoonBeijingChinaInternational Olympic CommitteeOlympicsUyghurs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
442,"China’s state-run Global Times boasted in an article on Thursday that Chinese people are increasingly becoming accustomed to the use of “emotion recognition technology,” artificial intelligence that allows the government to track human feelings, as part of everyday life.The Global Times illustrated the usefulness of this technology with an example in which police arrest passengers of a car after using artificial intelligence to discover drugs in their car. “Emotion recognition technology” tells the officers that the passengers are more nervous than the average person at a checkpoint, which they use as an excuse to search the car.The notoriously repressive Communist Party is allegedly applying “emotional recognition technology” in “various fields including health, anti-terrorism, and urban security,” according to the Global Times.The development of this technology to criminalize feelings follows increasingly alarming developments in Chinese law enforcement, most recently the revelation that Chinese technology giant Huawei is developing facial recognition technology that can identify a person’s ethnicity, making it easier for Chinese police to persecute members of the Uyghur ethnic minority. Multiple governments around the world, including the current and past administration of the United States, have accused China of committing genocide against the Uyghur people.The Communist Party has built over 1,000 concentration camps in the Uyghurs’ native region, Xinjiang, where survivors say they were forced into indoctrination, slavery, and subject to rape and torture. Of particular concern are reports that China is systematically sterilizing Uyghur women against their will to eliminate the ethnic group, a practice specifically listed in the definition of genocide.
The Communist Party claims that the concentration camps are “vocational training centers” for uneducated people and that all eyewitnesses are liars and paid actors.The Global Times did not specifically mention using “emotion recognition technology” in Xinjiang, but did not that much of the experimentation with the medium appears to be conducted in China on inmates at prisons. At least six prisons are openly using this technology on its inmates to predict which are the most likely to be violent, the newspaper claimed.As China considers any slight or criticism of the Communist Party a crime – often formally identified as “subversion of state power” or “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” – many of those experimented on are likely political prisoners. It is also illegal in China to hold religious views outside of the regulation of the state, and only five religions are legal: Taoism, Buddhism, Islam, Catholicism, and Protestant Christianity.“[I]n China, emotion recognition has contributed to the risk assessment of prisoners in a few regional prisons,” the Global Times noted, citing experimentation in a prison in Guangzhou in 2019. “The technology helps prison officers to evaluate whether a prisoner presents potential risks, including possible mental problems and violent or suicidal tendencies, and estimate whether he or she is likely to repeat an offense after release.”The state propaganda outlet quoted the head of the Guangzhou center conducting the experiments to justify its use, who detailed, “After a prisoner looks at the camera for three to four seconds, this recognition system can know his or her seven main physiological indexes including body temperature, eye movement, and heart rate, and convert them into psychological signs showing whether the prisoner is calm, depressed, angry or whatever else at that time.”Outside of prisons, the state newspaper lauded “emotion recognition technology” for its uses on the road, where police can track the emotions of every driver and stop anyone with “abnormal” feelings. This, it claimed, would help prevent road rage incidents or other potentially criminal behavior.The Global Times cited Chinese “experts” who claimed that Chinese AI could identify a person’s emotions with up to 95-percent accuracy.“Emotion recognition is definitely the direction of humanity’s future tech development,” a “neuromanagement expert” told the newspaper.The technology can work by either monitoring a person’s face for an extended period of time or by forcing individuals to wear devices that track their blood pressure, temperature, and other factors.The Global Times mentioned that, outside of China, the public may express concerns for their privacy and safety in the event that their governments implement this form of AI to monitor their emotions. The Times claimed that the technology is already in use in several states, however, including America, and insisted, citing Chinese government-approved experts, that it is “not an evil ‘mind-reading’ technique.”According to the MIT Technology Review, “emotion recognition technology” was already a $20 billion market in 2019.“The technology is currently being used to assess job applicants and people suspected of crimes, and it’s being tested for further applications, such as in VR headsets to deduce gamers’ emotional states,” the outlet observed at the time, citing a study by AI Now.

The state-run China Central Television (CCTV) reported on the PLA war games near the Paracels on Wednesday without specifying the exact date of the exercises, though it said they occured “in recent days.” The joint military drills included members of China’s Navy, Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force.The PLA simulated a mock beach landing near Triton Island, located in the Paracel island chain, “to explore the tactics and methods of joint warfare,” CCTV reported March 3.The video shows several Type 726 air-cushioned landing craft, also known as hovercraft, “sailing off a Type 071 amphibious transport dock and rushing onto a beach, each with a Type 96A main battle tank and fully armed marine corps soldiers on board,” according to the CCTV report.“A Type 052D guided-missile destroyer, a Type 054A guided-missile frigate, and a support ship kept guard off the coast, while an Su-30MKK fighter and an H-6K bomber provided air cover,” CCTV relayed.The mock assault exercise saw PLA Marine Corps troops land on the beach from amphibious vessels and helicopters, then face “strong fire resistance before the army tank team sent vehicles forward and destroyed enemy bunkers.”The PLA’s naval flotilla also practiced other training objectives during the Paracel drill such as “air defense, anti-missile operations, and helicopter take-off and landing at night,” according to the CCTV report and PLA statements.CCTV aired footage of China’s war games in the Paracels after the PLA launched a month-long military exercise in the disputed South China Sea on March 1. Beijing ordered the extensive military drill in response to a recent increase in the U.S. Navy’s reconnaissance operations in the contested waterway, which Washington describes as “freedom of navigation” exercises.Taiwan’s armed forces conducted live-fire shooting exercises from the South China Sea’s Pratas Island into its surrounding waters on March 1. Pratas Island is located 200 miles southeast of Hong Kong in the northern South China Sea. It is administered by Taiwan, itself a sovereign island state. Beijing claims both Taiwan and Pratas Island, which it says pertains to China’s coastal Guangdong province. Similarly, China views Taiwan as a renegade province and has vowed to retake the island by force if necessary; the PLA staged its own “street battle” war game against Taiwan in December.The Taiwanese coastguard said its March 1 live-fire drill on Pratas Island was part of a planned, annual training regime, which seeks “mainly to simulate the handling of intrusion by the PLA and Vietnamese ships.”AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaParacel IslandsPeople's Liberation Army (PLA)Taiwan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
444,"A top official China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged President Joe Biden to open America’s borders to China, but only after “recognizing” China’s faulty coronavirus vaccine candidates and making it illegal to travel without being vaccinated.Wu Zunyou, a top epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, suggested that lifting travel restrictions should occur once Beijing and Washington “mutually recognize vaccinations” and after America reaches “herd immunity” which he predicted would occur in August or September 2021. The Global Times, the state publication to which he made those statements, did not clarify if Wu interpreted vaccine “recognition” as simply identifying someone receiving a Chinese vaccine candidate as properly protected from the Chinese coronavirus or if he sought approval for distribution of Chinese vaccines by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA).China has approved two homemade vaccines against the Chinese coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China. Clinical trials found the first vaccine, known as “Coronavac” and manufactured by the firm Sinovac, to be only 50.38 percent effective against Chinese coronavirus, which the Global Times declared “good enough.” The second vaccine, developed by the pharmaceutical company Sinopharm, received approval late last month in China and was found to be 72.51 percent effective.In contrast, the top two vaccines approved in the United States are both significantly more effective. The first approved vaccine, by the firm Pfizer, is about 95 percent effective. The second, by Moderna, tested to 94.1 percent effectiveness.This week, the FDA approved a third American vaccine by Johnson & Johnson, found to be 66 percent effective.Chinese state media has repeatedly attacked the Pfizer option, the most effective one so far approved, while Beijing has secured at least one shipment of 100 million doses.Wu, the Chinese epidemiologist, told the Global Times on Tuesday “China and the U.S. should mutually recognize vaccinations in the other country and limit free travel to only those who have been vaccinated.”Wu claimed, speaking at a forum, “China is the safest country in the world in terms of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] prevention,” citing Communist Party statistics that have been questioned in several studies for over a year.“If that is the case and if we could remove all political barriers, just based on science, the two countries could possibly be the first two countries to lift travel restrictions with each other,” Wu claimed, a false statement given that India has lifted restrictions with several countries through a “bubble” system similar to what Wu is proposing for America and China.Also present at the forum Wu spoke in – hosted by dictator Xi Jinping’s alma mater, Tsinghua University, and the Brookings Institute – was disgraced former head of the American CDC, Thomas Frieden, who proposed sharing intellectual property on vaccines and medications for coronavirus with China.The Chinese Communist Party is the world’s largest intellectual property thief. Prior to the pandemic, one in five American companies said in a nationwide survey that they had had intellectual property stolen from them by Chinese agents.“Frieden proposed that both countries share intellectual property and techniques in COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing to jointly expand global vaccination, so that manufacturers and other parts of the world can benefit from what really should be a public good,” the Global Times reported.Frieden ran the CDC during history’s largest Ebola outbreak; under his tenure, the administration of President Barack Obama received heavy criticism for its poor handling of both offering aid to the affected countries and insufficiently limiting travel to the United States to prevent the spread of the disease. Following his tenure, Frieden was arrested in 2018 on charges of sexual abuse, which he pled guilty to.China’s proposal of mandating coronavirus vaccines to travel echoes a demand late last year by Chinese dictator Xi Jinping that the world implement a system in which all individuals are assigned a QR code to track their health status. The system, he suggested, would grade individuals based on their health history and ban them from certain travel if their governments deemed them too ill.“We need to further harmonise policies and standards and establish ‘fast tracks’ to facilitate the orderly flow of people,” Xi urged. “[We] hope more countries would participate.”Chinese citizens are subject to extreme travel restrictions, both at home and abroad. Chinese citizens’ ability to travel and move to different cities nationwide is limited by their hukou, a registration system designed to keep poor and rural Chinese from living near the Communist Party elite. Their behavior generally is limited by China’s “social credit system,” which gives each individual a numerical score based on their loyalty to the Communist Party. Individuals with low “social credit” scores cannot board public transportation, trains, or flights.President Donald Trump limited travel between the United States as China on January 21, 2020, shortly after news began circulating of a contagious respiratory disease in Wuhan. Current President Joe Biden enthusiastically opposed the ban, calling it “hysterical xenophobia.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsCenters for Disease ControlChinacommunismcoronavirusThomas FriedentravelU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
445,"China’s state-run Global Times bragged Sunday that Chinese companies are making a fortune selling syringes and needles to the United States during the coronavirus pandemic, a tidal wave of imports that makes a mockery of “the U.S. government’s attempt to get rid of the Chinese supply chain.”The Global Times quoted U.S. officials admitting in congressional testimony that 80 percent of the needles and syringes used in the United States, and about 90 percent of the supplies purchased worldwide, originate from China. Chinese officials said China’s factories produce hundreds of thousands of syringes a day.According to Chinese government and business sources, low costs of production and labor, combined with supply chains that have not been decimated by the coronavirus as thoroughly as those in most other countries, make the Chinese syringe industry unbeatable.“Orders have been piling up for several months, and we are expanding our production to meet the rising demand. With the new production lines to be completed in early May, our monthly capacity will be quadrupled to 40 million units,” an anonymous corporate executive told the Global Times.Other Chinese industry sources said they have orders backed up through the summer of 2021 as coronavirus vaccinations have increased global demand for needles. They said U.S. orders began flooding in about six months ago. Heavy demand is causing syringe prices to surge, but according to the Global Times, U.S.-made syringes are still over twice as expensive as Chinese products.The Global Times claimed in late January that Chinese manufacturers were struggling to meet the demand for needles from the U.S. and UK even after building new production facilities and quadrupling the price for their products. Several Chinese companies said the same to Reuters in early February, with warnings that the Lunar New Year holiday could hinder production.U.S. vaccination programs are keenly interested in “low-dead space” syringes, a relatively uncommon and expensive design that minimizes the amount of fluid retained between the plunger and needle after a shot is administered. Medical technicians have discovered that using low-dead space syringes allows them to extract six doses from many vials of Pfizer’s Chinese coronavirus vaccine instead of the five doses the vials are rated for. American multinational firm Becton Dickinson and Co., the world’s largest single supplier of needles and syringes, agreed to produce 286 million syringes for coronavirus vaccinations, but only 40 of them were planned to be low-dead space models. The company said its capacity to produce low-dead space syringes is limited because they have been less commonly used until now, and the idea of squeezing extra doses from the Pfizer vials was not introduced until after the government’s orders were placed.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacommunismcoronavirusvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
446,"The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will begin military exercises in the South China Sea — which China illegally claims is entirely within its territory — on Monday, in a move Chinese social media framed as a message to the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden.China’s claims in the South China Sea span over the sovereign territory of five countries: Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Taiwan. The government of the Philippines sued China at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, a venue open only to state claimants, and received a favorable ruling in 2016 which affirmed the illegality of Beijing’s claims. China has since openly vowed to defy the ruling and the Philippines, under a new presidential administration, has done little to challenge China’s continued presence in its waters.Recent satellite images suggest China has embarked upon further illegal construction operations in parts of Vietnam and the Philippines throughout the time of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, when the territorial dispute had largely disappeared from news headlines.The state-run Global Times newspaper announced the month-long military drills in the sea on Sunday and framed them as a message to Washington, more than one to Manila or Hanoi. The Chinese military will ban all non-PLA ships from entering the territory used for the drill for the entire month of March.“The exercises come at a time when the US has started to again frequently conduct close-up reconnaissance operations on China’s coastal regions as well as on hydrological environments in the South China Sea,” the Global Times noted. The U.S. Navy has regularly conducted what are known as “Freedom of Navigation Operations” (FONOPs) in the South China Sea for years, meant to challenge the idea that the territory in question is exclusively Chinese. The FONOPs are conducted openly and legally.The Global Times appeared to take issue not with the FONOPs, but with alleged “reconnaissance” exercises by both the United States and France, accusing them of “eavesdropping” on the PLA. The newspaper concluded, citing Communist Party-approved “experts,” that China should “enhance combat preparedness” to confront the U.S. military.Perhaps in response to China’s announcement, Taiwan — a sovereign state that China claims illegally as a rogue province — announced live-fire exercises in the South China Sea on Monday. Focus Taiwan noted that the country had enhanced its military exercises and increased the presence of its Coast Guard in disputed territory in response to growing numbers of illegal Chinese aircraft excursions into Taiwanese airspace since the inauguration of President Joe Biden.“The drills are being staged amid almost daily flights by Chinese military aircraft into airspace around Taiwan, in particular in the southwest part of Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) near the Pratas Islands in recent months,” Focus Taiwan noted.Chinese activity in the sovereign territory of Taiwan has also recently caused alarm. The South China Sea Chronicle Initiative (SCSCI), a non-governmental organization (NGO), published images last week of what appeared to be a surface-to-air missile base built by the Chinese on an island close to Vietnamese waters. Similar images found ongoing illegal Chinese construction in the Philippines in the past year.For years, while the Philippines and China litigated at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Chinese engineers built artificial islands on reefs in the Spratly and Paracel Islands, legally part of Vietnam and the Philippines. Satellite images of those artificial islands appear to show missiles, surveillance technology, and other military assets placed in the territory. Beijing has responded to global criticism of its development in the territory of other countries by claiming that it has only placed civilian assets on those artificial islands and that they are meant for “search and rescue” operations as well as for monitoring the weather.Environmentalists have for years decried China’s construction in the region, noting that the delicate reef ecosystems there could not have survived being buried by dredging. China had destroyed at least 17 major reefs in the region by 2015, according to the Philippine government.“China occupies seven reefs in the Spratlys. It is reclaiming on all seven reefs. Although it occupies seven reefs, it is using filling materials from 10 other reefs so China has actually destroyed 17 reefs in total,” Philippine Supreme Court Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio revealed that year.Construction and overfishing by Chinese ships — which do not have the legal authority to be in much of the territory they have exploited — have exacerbated the environmental destruction. In addition to overfishing in the region, Chinese ships have repeatedly harassed and attacked Vietnamese and Filipino vessels present in these territories legally.“If you built something, if you’ve put dirt, rubble, and pavement [on top of coral reefs] … There’s no way to recover that,” John McManus, a professor of marine biology at the University of Miami in Florida, told Radio Free Asia (RFA) in October.Experts have lamented that, prior to China’s construction, the Spratly Island region was one of the world’s richest fishing deposits.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismEnvironmentMalaysiaPhilippinesSouth China SeaTaiwanVietnam.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
447,"The mayor of Wellington, New Zealand, faced criticism Friday for his participation in a local Lunar New Year celebration which included New Zealand Han Chinese dancers dressing up in the cultural garb of Uyghur Muslims, New Zealand’s Stuff news site reported.“The new year display included New Zealand Han Chinese dancers, dressing up in the cultural dress of Uyghur Muslims, and performing a Uyghur dance,” according to the report. The event was organized on February 12 by Wellington’s China Cultural Center and received financial support from Wellington’s Council City Housing.“The Chinese Cultural Centre is part of the Chinese state’s united front apparatus. While it is a New Zealand incorporated society, it was founded and is managed by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the People’s Republic of China,” Stuff news noted on February 26.The event included other multicultural celebrations in addition to the Lunar New Year performance, which Wellington Mayor Andy Foster attended. Foster came under fire this week for his appearance in photos alongside some Han Chinese dancers dressed in Uyghur ethnic garb.“In the spirit of goodwill and in my role as the Mayor for all people of Wellington City, I appeared in a number of photos featuring the many groups at this event,” Foster said after New Zealand media outlets began to circulate the photos.A New Zealand-based Uyghur man named Shawudun Abdulgofur told Stuff news he was “disgusted” at what he viewed as cultural appropriation at the Lunar new year event, noting Uyghurs only celebrate the Lunar New Year in China when the state compels them to do so.“This is very very disrespectful, considering that Uyghurs cannot practice our culture in East Turkestan,” he told the news site.“East Turkestan” is the name Uyghurs use to refer to Xinjiang, a western Chinese territory where the majority of China’s Uyghurs reside. “Xinjiang” is a Mandarin term meaning “new frontier,” emphasizing its distance from the homeland of the Han people. Uyghurs are a majority Sunni Muslim, Turkic-speaking people native to Xinjiang, which borders Central Asia.Human rights organizations accuse the Chinese government of detaining 1 to 3 million Uyghurs in state-run concentration camps in Xinjiang since at least 2017. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) refers to the facilities as “vocational” or re-education camps and says they are part of a greater campaign to train Uyghurs for the Chinese labor force and de-radicalize alleged Islamist extremists within Xinjiang’s Muslim community.Survivors and former employees of the camps told the BBC in a report published February 2 that they experienced or witnessed systematic rape, sexual abuse, and physical torture of Uyghur detainees at the facilities, which are operated by provincial CCP officials based in Xinjiang.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaLunar New YearNew ZealandUyghurWellington.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
448,"Hong Kong authorities charged 47 pro-democracy activists in the city with “conspiracy to subvert state powers” over the weekend, Radio Television Hong Kong reported Sunday.Police in Hong Kong said they had charged 39 men and eight women, aged 23 to 64, with the offense, and that the group would be detained overnight on February 28 and then brought to the city’s West Kowloon court for mention on March 1. Hong Kong’s League of Social Democrats, a pro-democracy political party, said its vice chairmen, Leung Kwok-hung and Jimmy Sham, were among those charged.Subversion is a crime under Hong Kong’s national security law, which China imposed on the city last summer as a means to discourage Hong Kong’s then year-long pro-democracy protest movement. The legislation undermined Hong Kong’s former semi-autonomy from China and precipitated a crackdown by authorities on the movement’s leaders.The “national security” law requires a minimum of ten years in prison for those found guilty.Hong Kong police said on February 28 that the 47 pro-democracy politicians and activists charged with subversion were among 55 Hongkongers arrested on suspicion of “subverting state power” for their involvement in Hong Kong primary elections last summer. The July 2020 primary elections would have chosen candidates for Legislative Council of Hong Kong (Legco) polls scheduled later that year. Hong Kong’s pro-China chief executive, Carrie Lam, invoked an emergency ordinance in August 2020 to delay the elections until September 5, 2021, citing health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic.Observers viewed the elections’ postponement as a setback for Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition leaders, who had been campaigning to make gains in Legco against the council’s pro-China majority. A group of 22 opposition lawmakers issued a statement accusing Lam of using the pandemic as an excuse to delay the vote and unfairly curb the pro-democracy movement’s momentum.“Incumbent pro-democracy legislators, who represent 60 percent of the public’s opinion, collectively oppose the postponement and emphasize the responsibility of the SAR government to make every effort to arrange adequate anti-epidemic measures to hold elections in September as scheduled,” the group said, using China’s official name for the city, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).“Otherwise, it is tantamount to uprooting the foundation of the establishment of the SAR,” the group added.Prior to the vote’s postponement, Hong Kong government officials had disqualified some opposition leaders from participating in the Legco primaries. The Hong Kong Liaison Office — Beijing’s top representative office in the city — issued a statement in July 2020 saying it supported the candidates’ disqualifications. The politicians had aimed to gain enough Legco seats to “paralyze the government” and “subvert state power,” according to the liaison office.The 47 opposition activists charged with subversion over the weekend faced their first court appearance at Hong Kong’s West Kowloon courthouse on March 1. Over 100 pro-democracy protesters gathered outside the courthouse on Monday morning in support of their fellow activists. The demonstrators held signs with messages including “Release all Political Prisoners” and chanted the pro-democracy slogan “liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,” according to Hong Kong Free Press. Chanting the slogan alone is considered a violation of the “national security” law punishable by a minimum of ten years in prison.Some protesters loudly chanted the slogan ""liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time"" – deemed illegal by the gov't.

449,"The United States Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), an agency that monitors U.S. spending in the country, found over $2 billion in wasted taxpayers’ dollars in its latest review, the Afghan news agency Khaama Press reported Monday.SIGAR regularly traces the use of American funding in the country, monitoring facilities and other assets built with American money and judging the projects based on their usefulness to the area in which they were built. SIGAR reports regularly find extensive financial waste in the country, including American expenditures on unusable buildings, entertainment venues, or misuse of funds that have ended up helping opium cultivation.The United States invaded Afghanistan in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, overthrowing the jihadist Taliban regime in response to its harboring of al-Qaeda terrorists. President Joe Biden’s administration announced Monday it would continue the peace talks his predecessor, Donald Trump, began with both the legitimate Afghan government in Kabul and the Taliban, though multiple government officials have hinted Biden may not respect the Trump administration’s promise to withdraw all American troops by May.The latest report, completed February 24 but surfacing in Afghan media Monday, studied about $7.8 billion in American money spent in Afghanistan.“Of the nearly $7.8 billion in capital assets reviewed in its prior reports, SIGAR identified about $2.4 billion in assets that were unused or abandoned, had not been used for their intended purposes, had deteriorated, or were destroyed,” the report read. “By contrast, SIGAR found that more than $1.2 billion out of the $7.8 billion in assets were being used as intended, and only $343.2 million out of the $7.8 billion in assets were maintained in good condition.”The assets discussed in the study were largely buildings constructed at the American taxpayers’ expense. SIGAR monitored 60 “assets” and found many were impossible to use because authorities responsible had not invested in upkeep, resulting in “broken or leaky pipes, damaged bathroom fixtures, or blocked drains;” dangerous water damage, structural damage to roofs, walls, or floors; and broken electrical wiring. Some of the assets reviewed showed signs of some repair in the form of “improvised wiring for broken electrical fixtures” that elevated the risk of a fire.Despite the waste, most of the 60 assets evaluated were being used properly and maintained appropriately.“To help ensure that U.S.-funded capital assets in Afghanistan are used as intended and maintained, Congress may wish to consider requiring U.S. agencies to develop, implement, and periodically update sustainment plans,” the SIGAR report suggested, “in coordination with the beneficiaries of future capital assistance projects.”The report noted that SIGAR began its work in 2008 and that Congress has, between then and now, appropriated “$109.24 billion for humanitarian, security, and reconstruction assistance in Afghanistan.” Prior SIGAR reports have unveiled the use of American taxpayer funding on projects such as a soccer stadium that was not built to standard measurements — and thus could not host games; staircases built going nowhere in one-floor buildings; and “counter-narcotics” programs that had no discernible effect. In 2018, a SIGAR report revealed that “agricultural” projects built with American money in Afghanistan were benefitting opium and heroin production.An agreement between the Trump administration and the Taliban on negotiating a U.S. exit from Afghanistan, presumably with an end to heavy investments like those SIGAR monitors, turned one year old on Sunday. Afghan officials used the opportunity to accuse the Taliban of breaking the deal and urge American officials not to withdraw.Afghanistan’s Tolo News compiled some of the pessimism out of Kabul on Sunday.“They (Taliban) have committed to cut their ties with terrorist groups; however, according to information obtained by the government, they have not cut these ties,” State Minister for Peace Affairs Sayed Saadat Mansoor Naderi said.“There isn’t anything in this agreement to give hope to Afghans. This has made progress in the peace process fragile,” said Rahmatullah Andar, spokesman for the National Security Council.“Afghans expected that violence would end when the deal was signed, but this did not happen and instead it increased,” President Ghani’s special envoy for Pakistan, Mohammad Umer Daudzai, said.The deal, later elaborated upon in meetings between Taliban leaders and American diplomats in September, would require the Taliban to no longer harbor foreign terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and to not attack American troops. In exchange, Washington would withdraw from Afghanistan by May 1.The Taliban insisted in an official statement Sunday that it had kept its commitments, despite many doubters.“The Taliban said that they have fulfilled their commitments to the agreement, blaming ‘the other side’ for violating the agreement and said the US has continued to bombings and operations,” according to Tolo News, which translated the statement. “The Taliban said any attempt to seek an alternative for the agreement will end to failure in peace efforts.”Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hinted in remarks to NATO last month that the Biden administration may not keep to the May 1 deadline. According to a readout of Austin’s comments to other NATO ministers, he “reassured Allies that the U.S. would not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan.”“We are still involved in trying to get a negotiated settlement. The Taliban have not met their commitments,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said shortly before Austin’s remarks. “As you know, there is a looming deadline of early May … but without them meeting our commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan National security forces and by dint of that the Afghan people, it’s very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAfghanistanDonald TrumpJoe BidenLloyd AustinTalibanU.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
450,"The Islamist regime in Iran reportedly shut down a mobile data network in its southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan this week in response to ongoing protests against the alleged killing of local fuel smugglers by Iranian armed forces.NetBlocks, a worldwide internet access monitor, confirmed a new disruption to internet connectivity in Sistan and Baluchestan province beginning late Saturday, February 27. The monitor confirmed the internet cut-off following days of unverified reports by human rights groups describing “localized regional network disruptions” amid the protests, which began on February 22.Sistan and Baluchestan is a poor, remote province where nearly 96 percent of the population accesses the internet through their mobile phones. The government’s decision to shut down the province’s mobile data network as opposed to the landline internet connection suggests a targeted action, according to the British human rights organization Article 19.“This targeted shutdown was very intentional because they knew the realities of this province,” Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher at Article 19, told the Associated Press on February 28.Sistan and Baluchestan is one of Iran’s least developed regions. Located along Iran’s border with Pakistan and Afghanistan, the province is home to a largely Sunni population. The community makes up a minority within Iran’s greater Shiite majority population. Tensions between the province and the rest of Iran have caused several Sunni militant groups to crop up in Sistan and Baluchestan over the past several years. Many of the militant groups have demanded more regional autonomy from Iran and some have led a low-level violent insurgency to expand their power in recent years.Sistan and Baluchestan lies along a major drug and fuel trafficking route; residents of the province routinely transport drugs and small amounts of diesel fuel largely from Iran to Pakistan. Diesel fuel is highly subsidized in Iran and provides a key source of income for smugglers in the otherwise impoverished region.Members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) allegedly shot and wounded several fuel smugglers in the regional city of Saravan on February 22, resulting in at least two deaths. The incident prompted violent protests to break out across the city and surrounding area.A separate group of fuel smugglers tried to attack a police station in Saravanv shortly after the February 22 shooting, prompting Iranian border guards to open fire on the smugglers, wounding several. The next day a mob of people stormed a district governor’s office in southeastern Iran.“Videos showed the men screaming ‘Allahu Akbar’ as they punched through glass doors, yanked out air-conditioning units and smashed office furniture against the walls. Once inside, protesters waded through piles of overturned chairs and shattered glass, throwing objects all over the place,” the Associated Press reported on February 23, citing video footage shared via social media.The protests had spread across Sistan and Baluchestan and continued into their sixth consecutive day on February 27, according to Iranian dissidents. Residents of Zahedan claimed authorities had imposed martial law over the city as of Saturday.“Security forces are filling the streets and the regime has brought reinforcements from neighboring cities and towns. Some of the units have been brought in from the neighboring Kerman province,” the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), Iran’s largest dissident organization, reported on February 27.“Military helicopters continue to fly over many cities, including Zahedan and Ghaleh Bid,” the PMOI reported.AsiaNational SecurityInternet shutdownIranPakistanprotests.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
451,"Indian diplomats condemned the government of Pakistan on Tuesday for what they called the  “institutionalized violation of human rights” in that country before the United Nations, where Pakistan sits on the Human Rights Council.Pakistan became a member of the Human Rights Council last year, despite its extreme repression of religious minorities, particularly Christians and Ahmadi Muslims. “Blasphemy” against Islam is illegal in the country — blasphemy against Mohammed specifically is punishable by death — resulting in frequent, frivolous accusations of “blasphemy” against known local religious minorities. While Pakistan has never executed anyone for blasphemy, mob lynchings and assassinations of religious minority people are common.Pakistan’s Islamist Prime Minister Imran Khan vowed last year that the country would use its position on the U.N. Human Rights Council to promote criminalization of “blasphemy” against Islam on a global scale. Khan has personally urged the U.N. General Assembly to outlaw criticism of Islam around the world during his remarks at its annual general debate session.The Indian government condemned Pakistan’s poor human rights track record in a formal response to Pakistan’s condemnation of New Delhi before the United Nations. Pakistan and India have battled over control of the disputed territory of Kashmir since their founding as sovereign states; India regularly accuses Pakistan of allowing jihadist terrorist organizations to operate within its borders. Under Khan, Pakistan has escalated its criticism of India’s policies regarding Muslims in Kashmir. Khan himself has repeatedly compared counterpart Narendra Modi to Adolf Hitler and his ruling Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, as “Nazis.”India’s Statement as Right of Reply  to statements made by Pakistan and the OIC under Oral Update by the High Commissioner of Human Rights.@MEAIndia pic.twitter.com/GFbZ2SYcOB— India at UN, Geneva (@IndiaUNGeneva) March 2, 2021“Pakistan’s deliberate misuse of this august forum for its malicious propaganda against India, aimed at diverting the attention of the Council from its own serious violations of human rights, has remained a constant,” top Indian diplomat in Geneva Pawankumar Badhe wrote on Tuesday. Badhe’s statement rejected Pakistan’s accusations against India of inappropriate behavior in Kashmir and accused Pakistan of truly violating the spirit of the Human Rights Council.“Pakistan, a country in dire economic situation, will be well advised to stop wasting time of the Council and its mechanisms, stop state-sponsored cross-border terrorism and end institutionalised violation of human rights of its minority and other communities,” Badhe wrote. “The members of this Council are well aware that Pakistan has provided pensions to dreaded and listed terrorists out of State funds and has the dubious distinction of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations … it has become a factory for producing terrorists.”The Indian missive described terrorism as “the worst form of human rights abuses and the supporters of terrorism [as] the worst abusers of human rights.”It later noted Pakistan’s poor record of protecting religious minorities.“The Council should ask Pakistan why the size of its minority communities such as Christians, Hindus, and Sikhs has drastically shrunk since independence,” the statement read, “and why they and other communities such as Ahmadiyyas, Shias, Pashtuns, Sindhis, and Baloch, have been subjected to draconian blasphemy laws, systemic persecution, blatant abuses and forced conversions. Holy and ancient sites of religious minorities in Pakistan have been attacked and vandalized daily.”Pakistan’s legal system labels the state an Islamic institution, governed by Islamic law. Ahmadi Muslims, who believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, an Indian man born in 1835, was the promised Messiah of Islam, are explicitly excluded from government protections for Muslims and specifically discriminated against in seemingly irrelevant legal provisions. For example, all Pakistanis must declare Ahmadis “infidels” on government paperwork to receive passports and be able to leave the country. Ahmadis face extreme violence from their Sunni Muslim compatriots, including regular assassinations.The government of Pakistan recently attempted to prosecute two Ahmadi American citizens for running the official website of the Ahmadi Muslim community in the United States.Christians also face extreme persecution in the country, particularly from Muslim neighbors. Pakistani police regularly attack Christians when locals complain of alleged blasphemy violations. Pakistani police also often look away when local mobs organize violent attacks, including lynchings, of churches and homes of known Christian people.Pakistan’s one major contribution to the U.N. Human Rights Council was a resolution passed last year condemning “blasphemy.” Pakistan received a co-sponsorship from the Philippines for its “promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue” resolution, meant to promote “respect for religious symbols.”“The adoption of this resolution by the UN General Assembly is part of Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts inter alia for raising awareness about Islamophobia and countering the defamation of sacred religious personalities and symbols,” the Pakistan Foreign Ministry said at the time.While Pakistan suffers from extreme religious persecution, neighboring India is also an inhospitable environment for Christians. Unlike Pakistan, the main threat against Christians in India is Hindu nationalists, who consider Christianity a foreign religion no ethnic Indian should adhere to.“Christians are persecuted in all areas of public and private life, and anti-conversion laws (currently in nine states, with more considering adoption) are abused to harass and intimidate Christians,” the Christian aid group Open Doors revealed in a report published in January.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaFaithNational SecurityBlasphemy lawChristian persecutionChristiansImran KhanIndiaIslamPakistanradical islamU.N.

452,"China’s state-run Global Times interviewed a health “expert” Tuesday who suggested international arrivals to China should submit stool samples in lieu of the anal swabs some foreign travelers must receive to test for coronavirus.Lu Hongzhou, identified as an expert from China’s Fudan University Public Health Clinical Center, told the newspaper that he firmly supports anal swab coronavirus testing for international travelers to China because nasal or throat swab testing may produce false-negative results.“Anal swab testing will tell whether the person is a virus carrier immediately, and it will effectively prevent transmission,” Lu said.He further suggested that “for the testing, people staying under hotel quarantine can submit stool samples instead, so as to reduce the discomfort during the sampling process.”Some studies indicate anal swabs may be more reliable than nasal or throat swabs when testing for the Chinese coronavirus because traces of the virus remain in fecal matter longer than in the respiratory tract.“Current data available on COVID‐19 [coronavirus] would suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 virus is shed through the gastrointestinal system via feces. Some reports further indicate that a subset of COVID‐19 patients may continue to have positive SARS‐CoV‐2 anal/rectal swab and stool test after negative conversion of nasopharyngeal test,” the authors of one study write.Anal swab tests in China currently involve a cotton swab measuring three to five centimeters long “inserted in one’s rectum and gently rotated for 10 seconds of sample excavation” according to the Beijing health commission’s website. Chinese health authorities began using the method in January to test for coronavirus in certain travelers returning to China from overseas, close contacts of confirmed patients, and some workers believed to be at high risk of exposure to the virus.The Japanese government said Monday that some of its citizens arriving in China recently were subjected to anal swab tests for coronavirus during a mandatory quarantine period, which they say caused them “psychological distress.”Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary, Katsunobu Kato, said the Japanese government has made a request through the Japanese Embassy in Beijing for Chinese health authorities to stop forcing the method on its citizens.“Many Japanese employees in Beijing have criticized China’s carrying out coronavirus tests using anal swabs as an action that would humiliate people and could violate their human rights and dignity,” Japan’s Kyodo News reported on March 2.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacoronavirus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
453,"Internet security firm Cyfirma reported Monday that hackers linked to the Chinese government are attacking the computer systems of two major Indian pharmaceutical companies involved in producing vaccines for the Wuhan coronavirus.Cyfirma, based in Singapore and Tokyo, told Reuters on Monday the attacks are coming from a well-known hacker group designated Advanced Persistent Threat 10 (APT10) and commonly known as “Stone Panda.”APT10 has been active since 2009, generally targeting U.S. and allied defense, healthcare, and aerospace computer systems. Its attacks are mostly designed to steal information or sabotage foreign companies, giving Chinese commercial entities a competitive advantage. In this case, APT10 is apparently trying to steal coronavirus vaccine data to help China promote its own questionable vaccine products.The targets of the hacking campaign Cyfirma identified are Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India (SII), with the apparant objective of “exfiltrating intellectual property and getting competitive advantage over Indian pharmaceutical companies.”Bharat Biotech manufactures Covaxin, India’s first indigenous Chinese coronavirus vaccine. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Monday morning that he received a dose of Covaxin, demonstrating confidence in the Indian vaccine to counter criticism from some outside observers that it has not been tested adequately.SII is the world’s largest vaccine maker and is a major producer of the coronavirus vaccine developed by British pharma giant AstraZeneca. The Indian government granted SII emergency authorization to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine on January 6. Drug regulators for the European Union announced Monday they are auditing SII’s production facilities, presumably with an eye towards authorizing European imports of vaccine doses the Indian firm manufactured, although regulators have not made the details of the audit and possible import negotiations public. SII’s products may be needed because AstraZeneca has been struggling to meet European demand for its vaccine.Cyfirma chief executive Kumar Ritesh said hackers have discovered “vulnerable web servers” connected to SII’s network.“They have spoken about weak web application, they are also talking about weak content-management system. It’s quite alarming,” he said, evidently referring to chatter among the hackers.Reuters reported the Chinese Foreign Ministry, SII, and Bharat Biotech all declined to comment on the reported hacker attacks, while the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) would only confirm that it was aware of Cyfirma’s claims. Cyfirma issued a statement that said CERT has “checked” its work and acknowledged the threat.“Our technical analysis and evaluation verified the threats and attacks,” Cyfirma said.Reuters noted that companies in the United States and allied nations have been repeatedly hit by cyberattacks believed to originate in China, North Korea, and Russia during the development of coronavirus vaccines. Indian media reported Chinese state hackers have conducted malware attacks against at least a dozen Indian government agencies and state-owned corporations since relations between China and India deteriorated in the summer of 2020.AsiaNational SecurityScienceAstraZenecaChinacoronavirusCybersecurityIndiaSerum Institute of Indiavaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
454,"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has released an 80-page report, “Beat China: Targeted Decoupling and the Economic Long War,” which, along with other key documents, could serve as a guide for Americans as they think about how to compete with China. Cotton’s report envisions a Cold War against China—that is, a patient economic, strategic, and ideological struggle to beat China without firing a shot—not an actual hot war.  After all, we won the Cold War against the Soviet Union after five decades; today, the Arkansas lawmaker believes, we can do it again in Cold War 2.  Yet to sustain this new new cold war, Cotton notes, we need structural change here at home: Current U.S. federal government organization is not optimized to thwart China’s whole-of-society approach to the economic long war.  This has led to serious gaps in the performance of U.S. institutions, which today punch well below their weight, even given the positive reforms and initiatives of the past few years.In that last line, can observe Cotton’s tip of the hat to the Trump administration—“positive reforms and initiatives of the past few years”—even as his document maintains a sense of urgency about the future: There’s a lot more that still needs to be done. Yet Cotton also has history firmly in mind; he points to the National Security Act of 1947, one of the foundational reforms of Cold War 1, as a valuable template for action.  It was that legislation that reorganized the Pentagon, creating a new and independent U.S. Air Force, as well as setting up the Central Intelligence Agency. Surveying the situation at present, Cotton works his way through a long list of issues and concerns, highlighting the need for a comprehensive national strategy on trade, investment, and intellectual property (IP).  He notes, for instance, that documented cases of Chinese IP theft in the U.S. have soared 1,300 percent in the last decade; the IP loss to America totals in the hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars.  ,Furthermore, Cotton zeroes in on sectors that have been targeted by China, including U.S. higher education—both bribed and compromised, he believes—and then focuses on unmet needs, concerning the supply of crucial rare earth elements, the construction of 5G broadband, and the safe development of artificial intelligence.   And as to solutions, he puts the focus where it belongs: applying a Hamiltonian emphasis on protecting and promoting our ability to make vital wares here at home.  For those who wish to dig deeper into these topics, Cotton provides no fewer than 326 footnotes.Yet here we might pause to observe that the senator puts great emphasis on some subjects, and yet not enough on others.  For instance, he mentions “Hollywood” 28 times, focusing on the American entertainment sector’s unseemly eagerness to censor itself, worldwide, in pursuit of the China market and Chinese investment.  And yet at the same time, “religious freedom” goes unmentioned, as do China’s oppressed Christians, or the even more oppressed Muslim Uyghurs, or the unlucky followers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement.  Nobody should think of Cotton as anything other than a staunch champion of religious freedom, including in communist regimes, and yet the inclusion of faith as a matter of concern—and as a point of leverage—would have made this document even stronger.No doubt Cotton will have more to say about China and freedom, including religious freedom, in the future.  In the meantime, this report—the old-fashioned term for which would be white paper—ends on a powerful note: By putting national security concerns at the forefront of our economic contest with China, strengthening our industrial base and supply chains, and better coordinating and protecting our nation’s research enterprise, America can create the government infrastructure it needs to properly utilize its vast capabilities and triumph in the long economic war. Fortunately for America, Cotton is not alone in raising concerns about China and calling for a stronger policy toward that totalitarian communist-capitalist regime.  Two years ago, for instance, this author took note of another muscular report on the China threat, that one from Sen. Marco Rubio. Indeed, concern about China is spreading widely.  Just on February 24, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported on the efforts of four Georgia Congressmen to persuade the Carter Center—the non-profit founded, of course, by former president Jimmy Carter—to cease and desist its cooperation with Chinese-government front groups.  The Carter Center, to be sure, is hardly unique in playing PRC-funded footsie; such cooperation with Big Panda has occurred all over the U.S., and while it may be legal, it’s surely wrong.Interestingly, the four Georgia lawmakers taking on this cause—Buddy Carter, Drew Ferguson, Jody Hice, and Austin Scott—are all members of the House Republican Study Committee, which, under the energetic leadership of Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, has staked out an ambitiously hawkish position on China.  So we can see: A new movement is afoot, as America First becomes the Defense of America—in conjunction, hopefully, with likeminded allies around the world.  Nobody wants a hot war with China, and nobody should think that the Chinese people themselves are the enemy.  Yet the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Xi Jinping, is a threat, and so we must to wake up to that threat.  Today, the CCP is sending its nasty tentacles around the world, much as the Soviet Union’s communist party was doing eight decades ago.   For the time being, the Biden administration and the Democrats have the power in Washington, D.C., and so we’ll have to see how they choose to to deal with the threat from China.  Hopefully, current Democratic leaders will stand strong. Yet if not, then, by the necessity of national security, the torch will be passed to a new generation of Republican leaders.  And Army veteran Tom Cotton, who delivered a strong message on security–at home and abroad–to the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 26, stands to be at the forefront of this new guard.AsiaNational SecurityChinacold warTom Cotton.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
455,"A Chinese lawmaker is preparing to introduce a bill at the opening of this week’s “Two Sessions,” where the Communist Party meets to draft and pass laws, requiring couples to take government-run marriage “training” classes before their weddings.China is experiencing surging divorce rates, particularly notable as strict lockdowns against the Chinese coronavirus receded last year, and a decrease in the number of young people seeking to get married. The Communist Party has also expressed concern about the dire state of the country’s birth rate, which has declined even after dictator Xi Jinping legalized having two children per couple in 2015. For decades, the Communist Party allowed couples to have only one child, forcing women into abortions, sterilizations, and infanticides when caught pregnant a second time.The “Two Sessions” are meetings of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The former is the government’s lawmaking body, which typically passes pro-communist laws without much debate or disagreement. The CPPCC is an advisory body that develops Communist Party messaging and policy to be distributed to local and regional officials.The “Two Sessions” will take place from March 4 to March 10. In anticipation of the meetings, the Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, is highlighting some of the major proposals that lawmakers expect to discuss with their colleagues. Among those highlighted on Wednesday is one by NPC representative Chen Aizhu of Zhejiang, who will seek to make it illegal to get married in China without Communist Party “training” on how to maintain a healthy marriage.“Carrying out premarital trainings is to help to improve people’s sense of responsibility to the family, encouraging the new couples to be loyal in marriage and cherish their family, Chen said,” according to the state newspaper. “She suggested that marriage and family associations to organize the trainings among the young people before they walk into a marriage.”Chen claimed that Chinese youth are “getting more open” in their attitudes towards relationships, which makes them more comfortable with divorce, and that Beijing has a responsibility to reverse that trend. Chen would also advise a “health check” before the couples marry; the Global Times did not elaborate on this point.China already places strict limitations on marriage generally. As the Global Times noted, couples must wait a 30-day “cooling period” after applying for a marriage license before getting married. Couples may only have a maximum of two children. In December, lawmakers drafted a bill that would limit how much food couples could serve at weddings, part of Xi Jinping’s anti-food waste “Clean Plate” campaign.The Global Times noted that Chinese “netizens” — or social media users who the government allows to post without arresting them — appeared hesitant to allow the government to “train” couples on how to properly conduct a marriage. Opposing this attitude in the piece is an alleged “expert,” a family lawyer who called Communist Party marriage training “very necessary.” Even this expert warned, however, that mandating training may lead to fewer marriages in general.“China has seen a continuous sharp drop in the marriage rate and increase in the divorce rate in the past eight years, a report shows,” the Global Times noted. “From 2013 to 2020, the number of marriage registrations fell from a record high of 13.47 million couples to 8.13 million, according to a report by Tsinghua University’s Evergrande Research Institute.”China saw a spike in the divorce rate after the culmination of draconian lockdown measures, which in cities like Wuhan, where the virus originated, involved welding people shut in their homes. In March 2020, the Global Times observed an increase in divorces in Xi’an, the local capital of Shaanxi province, beginning almost immediately after the marriage registration offices in the city reopened.“As a result of the epidemic, many couples have been bound with each other at home for over a month, which evoked the underlying conflicts, adding that the office had been closed for a month, therefore the office has seen an acutely increasing divorce appointment,” an official told the newspaper.A month later, the Global Times issued the same dire report about Wuhan. Shanghai and Shenzhen soon followed.By December, Chinese courts began rejecting divorce requests. In one notorious case, a Shaanxi court rejected a woman’s request to divorce her husband “despite her claims of being constantly beaten and scolded by her husband over the last 40 years.”“The court told her she should cherish their twilight years and could still be a happy family with forgiveness and better communication,” the Global Times reported. The husband reportedly claimed in defense of his abuses, “it is normal that old couples joke around.”The nationwide lockdowns to fight the pandemic also appear to have led to a significant decline in an already alarming birth rate. Government officials documented 10 million births in 2020, a 15-percent drop from 2019. In 2016, shortly after the implementation of a two-child policy, the birth rate was 17.86 million babies born.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismmarriageNational People's Congress.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
456,"A 38-year-old Chinese blogger named Qiu Ziming who writes under the name “Labixiaoqiu” on the social media platform Weibo was forced to broadcast a humiliating video apology on Tuesday for daring to question Beijing’s official narrative of the clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers in the Himalayas last June.After months of refusing to disclose how many casualties it suffered in the Galwan Valley hand-to-hand battle, the Chinese military claimed in February 2021 that it lost only four soldiers in the fight, compared to the 20 casualties that were long ago disclosed by the Indian government. Indian outlets claimed over twice the number of Chinese soldiers died as Indians.A great deal of skepticism was expressed online about China’s claim and their government quickly began arresting everyone who rebuked the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) narrative, charging them with illegally “defaming the country’s heroes and martyrs.”Qiu Ziming appeared on a prime-time broadcast of China’s state-run CCTV network, clad in a prison uniform and locked in a cell, to denounce himself for “smearing” the “heroes” of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). “I feel extremely ashamed of myself, and I’m very sorry. My behavior was an annihilation of conscience,” groveled the imprisoned blogger, who had about 2.5 million followers on Weibo before his account was suspended.“During the many years I surfed online, my writings have become more and more frivolous and arrogant. Without learning about the whole picture, I spoke ill of the heroes who gave their lives to guard our home. My words not only hurt the reputation and honor of those soldiers, but of all PLA soldiers,” he said during his one-minute apology video.The Hindustan Times noted that the CCP keeps forcing prisoners to make “confession” videos before they even go to trial, despite condemnation of the practice from across the free world as a human rights violation. Qiu was arrested two weeks ago and formally charged on Monday, the first of seven detainees to be charged for questioning the official government narrative of the Galwan Valley clash. The law against “defaming martyrs” he was charged with was rewritten on the very same day his charges were filed.Chinese media stubbornly refused to specify exactly what Qiu wrote that was so offensive, but India Narrative said on the day of his arrest the blog included a video posted by the PLA that made its claim of losing only four soldiers look absurd.“If you look at it carefully, the four who lost their lives were honored for their ‘rescues.’ If even the people who went to save others were sacrificed, then that must mean there were people who weren’t saved, which means there must be more than four people who died,” Qiu reasoned.In subsequent Weibo posts, Qiu suggested the highest-ranking Chinese officer at the Galwan clash fled the scene to save his own life. The youth wing of the CCP reported his post to the authorities, triggering his arrest on the all-purpose charge of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.” He faces up to ten years in prison.The South China Morning Post described Qiu’s skeptical posts as a “contrast to the tide of poems and tributes unleashed online since the identification of the soldiers,” which Weibo gathered and promoted under a hashtag that translated to “they died for me.”  China’s state-run Global Times reported on Tuesday that schoolchildren are being taught to revere the “five precious frontier soldiers” – four “martyrs” plus one wounded – from the Galwan Valley battle. School administrators linked them to the “medical heroes” who helped battle the coronavirus in the “hero city” of Wuhan.Inconveniently for the CCP’s myth-making and dissent-quashing efforts, PLA officers have quoted varying numbers of Galwan Valley casualties when holding discussions with Indian military officials or talking among themselves, with some estimating as high as 14 deaths. The Indian military estimates that between 25 and 40 PLA soldiers died in the battle, including at least one officer.AsiaMediaPoliticsChinese Communist PartyGalwan ValleyHimalayasIndiaInternet Censorshippeople's liberation army.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
457,"Chinese health authorities and state media aggressively defended “Coronavac,” a Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate by the Chinese firm Sinovac, on Wednesday after a 63-year-old Hong Kong man died this week following the administration of his first dose.Coronavac is the first of two Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines approved by the Communist Party. Scoring at a little over 50-percent effectiveness rate in preventing Chinese coronavirus infections, it is considered among the lowest-quality vaccines currently approved for distribution on a large-scale level. It is particularly ineffective compared to two of the three vaccines approved for emergency use in the United States: the vaccine by Pfizer, which is 95 percent effective, and the Moderna product, testing at 94-percent effectiveness.The Chinese Communist Party has undertaken a global campaign to sell “Coronavac” to allied nations, particularly impoverished countries that cannot afford the American products. It has done comparatively little to advertise the vaccine at home, resulting in extremely low rates of interest among Chinese people in taking it. A poll published last month found that less than half of health workers in Zhejiang, China, were interested in taking a coronavirus vaccine. About 28 percent said they would not seek out the vaccine on their own once it was approved for regular, not just emergency, use.Similarly, in Hong Kong, a University of Hong Kong poll published in January showed less than 30 percent of residents were willing to take “Coronavac,” compared to 46 percent who would take a vaccine against coronavirus generally. The distrust in the formerly autonomous city appears to be growing rapidly in light of the death of a 63-year-old man Sunday shortly after taking his first dose of the Sinovac product.The man, local sources reported, suffered from several physical ailments that made him a candidate for early vaccination, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and bronchitis. He received his first dose of Coronavac on Friday and died Sunday. Hong Kong health officials noted the doctors tending to him did not know that he had received a dose of a coronavirus vaccine when he was hospitalized on Sunday, possibly leading them not to pursue life-saving treatment.Both Hong Kong and Communist Party officials have repeatedly insisted they do not have evidence directly linking the vaccination to his death.“At the moment, the causal relationship with the vaccination could not be ascertained,” Hong Kong’s Department of Health said in a statement.China’s Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, insisted Wednesday a link between the vaccination and the man’s death was “extremely unlikely,” instead claiming that vaccines using mRNA technology, like the Pfizer and Moderna products, are more dangerous. The Global Times has repeatedly attacked Pfizer, claiming a small number of deaths of senior citizens in Europe following the injection of the Pfizer product proved that it was more dangerous than Coronavac.Among the “experts” that the Global Times quoted to make this claim was the CEO of Sinovac, Yin Weidong.Despite the patient’s death, Yin said, “we are confident in the overall safety of the Sinovac vaccine as it was proven to be safe from observations of mass vaccinations.”Another “expert” in the piece, the head of the China Vaccine Industry Association, dismissed the death as a “coincidence.”A third, a Party-approved Hong Kong official, insisted in the piece that the vaccine is “safe and effective, the benefits outweigh the risks, and the vaccination program will continue.” Yet another Hong Kong official complained that Hong Kong’s free media was “sensationalizing” the issue; unlike communist China, Hong Kong has a long history of maintaining free, spirited journalism, though Beijing has recently attempted to suppress that tradition.Hong Kong began vaccinating its population Friday, the same day the unidentified victim received his first dose of the Sinovac product. The vaccination program is open to those age 60 or older, health workers, or those with medical conditions that make them vulnerable to severe coronavirus infection. “Coronavac” is the first vaccine to be distributed, but the Hong Kong government expects to offer a variety of products in the future.The Sinovac vaccine uses inactivated coronavirus cells to spur the human immune system to create antibodies, preventing an infection. This is a more traditional vaccination method than the technology used by the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which prompt the creation of antibodies with the introduction of mRNA, a protein present on the surface of the coronavirus cell without actually exposing the human body to coronavirus.China approved another vaccine last week by a different pharmaceutical company, Sinopharm, found to be 72.51 percent effective.Chinese media, and the Global Times in particular, have launched a campaign against Pfizer, claiming “Chinese health experts” believe its far more effective vaccine to be deadly.“Yang Zhanqiu, a virologist from Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Friday that the death incident, if proven to be caused by the vaccines, showed that the effect of the Pfizer vaccine and other mRNA vaccines is not as good as expected, as the main purpose of mRNA vaccines is to heal patients,” a Global Times article warned in January. Yang again attacked Pfizer in Wednesday’s article about the Hong Kong death.An anonymous Beijing immunologist told the state media outlet in January that “the world should suspend the use” of the Pfizer product and turn to Chinese alternatives, instead.The deaths the Global Times has referred to of patients receiving the Pfizer vaccine occurred in Norway; the victims were all over 80 years old, some over 90 years old, and all in frail health condition.A Chinese firm contracted to buy 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine in December.AsiaNational SecurityScienceChinacommunismcoronavirusHong KongPfizerSinovac.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
458,"Amnesty International (AI) said Wednesday that it would remove “prisoner of conscience” status from Russian dissident and prisoner Alexei Navalny after deeming some of his past comments “hate speech” or advocacy of violence. The organization said it would nevertheless continue pushing for Navalny’s release from prison.
Navalny was arrested in January upon returning to Moscow from Berlin, where he received treatment for a chemical-weapons attack that he believes (and has taken steps to prove) Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered. Navalny recently received a two-and-a-half year prison sentence, ostensibly for violating his parole by seeking treatment for his Novichok poisoning in Germany.AI declared Navalny a “prisoner of conscience” soon after his arrest and demanded his immediate release, along with the release of journalists arrested with him at Vnukovo Airport in Moscow.“Aleksei Navalny’s arrest is further evidence that Russian authorities are seeking to silence him. His detention only highlights the need to investigate his allegations that he was poisoned by state agents acting on orders from the highest levels,” AI Moscow Director Natalia Zviagina said January 17.“Aleksei Navalny has been deprived of his liberty for his peaceful political activism and exercising free speech. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience and calls for his immediate and unconditional release. The organization reiterates its call to the Russian authorities to open a criminal investigation into Navalny’s poisoning and ensure that all those responsible are brought to justice in fair trial proceedings,” AI said in its statement denouncing Navalny’s arrest.AI told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) on Wednesday that Navalny’s status as a prisoner of conscience had been rescinded, offering only a vague explanation for the decision:Denis Krivosheev, deputy director of Amnesty’s Europe and Central Asia office, confirmed to RFE/RL in an e-mailed response on February 24 that the “internal decision” was made “in relation to comments [Navalny] made in the past” and that the decision “does not change our resolve to fight for his immediate release, and for an end to his politically motivated persecution by the Russian authorities.“Some of these comments, which Navalny has not publicly denounced, reach the threshold of advocacy of hatred, and this is at odds with Amnesty’s definition of a prisoner of conscience,” Krivosheev said, without specifying which comments he was referring to. Krivosheev said AI still demands Navalny’s release and has delivered a petition with 200,000 signatures to the Russian government.The BBC obtained more specifics from AI spokesman Alexander Artemev in Moscow, who said Navalny’s status was rescinded after the human rights organization was “bombarded” with complaints about comments the imprisoned Russian dissident made in the 2000s.Artemev said the organization suspected this was an “orchestrated campaign” to discredit Navalny, but it went along with the effort anyway and removed his prisoner of conscience designation because he appeared to “compare immigrants to cockroaches” in a video from 15 years ago.“We had too many requests. We couldn’t ignore them,” the AI spokesman said, before conceding those requests appear to have been orchestrated by a single shadowy activist who has a history of parroting Russian propaganda in a bid to “delegitimize Navalny’s work and criticism and to weaken public outcry about his detention”:Some of the calls to revoke Navalny’s prisoner of conscience status quoted a Twitter thread by Katya Kazbek, a freelance columnist published by the pro-Kremlin channel RT amongst others. She reposted Navalny’s controversial videos after his arrest in January, describing him as an “avowed racist” and accusing supporters of “whitewashing” his nationalism. Ms Kazbek, a pseudonym, describes herself online as a “feminist, LGBT researcher, citizen of the world”, but her posts include praise of Stalin and also echo Kremlin claims that Alexei Navalny is controlled by the US government.Since Navalny’s return to Russia in January after recovering from the attempt to kill him, other English-language Twitter accounts have regularly latched on to posts to slam him as a “vile white supremacist”.Reuters cited a 2007 video in which Navalny “called for the deportation of migrants to prevent the rise of far-right violence” and declared, “We have a right to be Russians in Russia, and we’ll defend that right.”Navalny supporters blasted AI for its decision, noting that Russian state media immediately applauded the downgrade to Navalny’s status and claimed Kazbek as one of its “columnists.”“It’s shocking and shameful. … Navalny is deemed no longer to be a ‘prisoner of conscience’ because his views are now deemed ‘hate speech’? I forgot that only woke pacifists can experience persecution,” author Mark Galeotti said on Twitter, as quoted by RFE.Navalny ally Leonid Volkov snorted that AI was “fed crap and liked it.” Aleksandr Golovach, a lawyer who works with Navalny’s FBK anti-corruption foundation, voluntarily renounced his own status as a prisoner of conscience to protest AI submitting to “the pressure of Putin’s state propaganda.”AsiaNational SecurityAlexei NavalnyAmnesty Internationalhuman rightsRussiaVladimir Putin.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
459,"Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan denounced “an attempted military coup” on Thursday after a group of Armenian army officers wrote a letter demanding Pashinyan’s resignation earlier that day.“As [prime minister] my order to all soldiers, officers, and generals of the armed forces is: Gentlemen, do your jobs. Preserve the territorial integrity of the borders of the Republic of Armenia. This is my order, and no one should dare to break this order,” Pashinyan said at a rally of his supporters in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on February 25.About 20,000 people gathered in Yerevan’s Republic Square to listen to Pashinyan’s speech, which followed a march led by the prime minister through the capital’s downtown area. He was flanked by a significant security detail, according to the U.S. government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL).The gathering was in response to the Armenian Armed Forces General Staff releasing a letter earlier that day demanding Pashinyan and his government resign.“The General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia expresses its resolute protest against the dismissal of the First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia for short-sighted reasons, which was carried out without taking into account the national and state interests of the Republic of Armenia,” the letter read.“In such difficult conditions for the country, such a decision is an anti-state, irresponsible step. The Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia, the government, will no longer be able to make adequate decisions in this critical situation for the Armenian people,” the letter further read.Armenian army officials, including Chief of the General Staff Onik Gasparian, signed the statement, which was published online.“Khachatrian had earlier mocked Pashinian’s analysis of Russian weapons used in the war against Azerbaijan” last year, according to RFE/RL.Pashinyan dismissed Gasparian shortly after the letter’s release Thursday morning.“The situation is tense, but we must agree that there cannot be clashes,” the Armenian prime minister said at his rally in Yerevan later Thursday.“I expect that the [Armenian] president [Armen Sarkisian] will sign the decree dismissing Gasparian or Gasparian will announce his resignation, and I will start consultations with the political forces on how we are going to solve this situation,” Pashinyan told his supporters.While Sarkisian’s role as Armenia’s president is largely symbolic, he said on Thursday that he was addressing Armenia’s power crisis with urgency, and called for all involved parties to “show restraint and common sense.”Pashinyan has faced increasing pressure to resign from his role as prime minister in recent months over his handling of Armenia’s six-week military conflict with Azerbaijan over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh which launched on September 27, 2020. Some observers criticized Pashinyan’s leadership during and after the conflict, which left Armenia with less territory than it had before clashes broke out over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, which both Armenian separatists and Azerbaijan claim.Pashinyan signed a Russian-brokered cease-fire deal to end the crisis in November 2020. The agreement forced Armenia to concede seven districts surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan that Armenian separatists had occupied since the early 1990s. The surrender caused a mass exodus of Armenians from the territories to Yerevan and upset many people in Armenia who blamed Pashinyan for the military defeat.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsArmeniacoupmilitary coupNikol PashinianNikol Pashinyan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
460,"Women detained in Chinese government-run camps in Tibet are “routinely raped” by their guards, Bitter Winter, an online human rights magazine, alleged on Thursday.“Just like Muslim women in Xinjiang, lay Buddhist girls and nuns are also submitted to systematic rape in Tibet’s transformation through education camps,” the magazine claimed on February 25.Some of Bitter Winter‘s Tibetan correspondents allegedly told the news site that guards at Tibetan re-education camps use cattle prods “to control and torture inmates, and it is common that they are used to rape women by inserting them in their private parts.”“[T]his routinely happens to nuns, who are told that their bodies ‘belong to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party]’ rather than to the monasteries,” a Tibetan source told Bitter Winter.“There is a political reason for this,” the magazine explained. “Once raped, a nun will difficultly be taken back by her monastery, and should settle for a secular life [sic].”China allegedly forced over 500,000 Tibetans into military-style camps designed to train “rural surplus laborers” into industrial workers in the first half of 2020, according to a study published in September by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. After completing “vocational training” at the camps, which includes political indoctrination designed by the Chinese Communist Party, Tibetans are transferred to work in factories across China according to the study, which cited Chinese government labor quotas.Chinese government officials often use the term “vocational training” to refer to state-run detention camps. The CCP has used the term to describe detention facilities in its western territory of Xinjiang, where state officials have allegedly detained one to three million Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities since 2017, according to estimates by human rights organizations. Survivors of Xinjiang’s camps have said they were subjected to communist ideological indoctrination, forced labor, physical torture, and sexual abuse.A BBC report published on February 2 alleged that guards at Xinjiang’s state-run detention camps implement “systematic rape” as a form of torture. The British broadcaster interviewed several people who said they were previously detained in or worked at the camps, some of whom said they witnessed actions similar to those described in Tibet’s forced labor camps by Bitter Winter on Thursday.“They  [the guards] had an electric stick, I didn’t know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock,” a woman named Tursunay Ziawudun told the BBC.“It is impossible to verify Ziawudun’s account completely because of the severe restrictions China places on reporters in the country, but travel documents and immigration records she provided to the BBC corroborate the timeline of her story,” the broadcaster noted.AsiaCrimeNational SecurityChinaconcentration campshuman rightsTibetXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
461,"China’s state-run Global Times newspaper mocked President Joe Biden on Friday, quoting his declaration, “America is back,” in a headline about his decision to bomb Syria on Thursday evening.Biden made the remark in a speech about foreign policy in early February, in which he vowed to limit American military engagement.“And they know when you speak, you speak for me,” Biden told diplomats at the State Department. “And so — so is the message I want the world to hear today: America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back at the center of our foreign policy.”On Thursday, 36 days into his presidency, Biden took unilateral action in Syria, ordering what the Pentagon dubbed a “defensive precision strike” on members of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a legal wing of the Iraqi armed forces.“At President Biden’s direction, U.S. military forces earlier this evening conducted airstrikes against infrastructure utilized by Iranian-backed militant groups in eastern Syria,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement. “Specifically, the strikes destroyed multiple facilities located at a border control point used by a number of Iranian-backed militant groups, including Kait’ib Hezbollah (KH) and Kait’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS).”The named groups are among the most influential members of the PMF, particularly KH, or the Hezbollah Brigades.The Global Times suggested Biden had undermined his promises to the American people in its coverage of the strikes, in an article it titled with Biden’s words, “America Is Back.” the Communist Party-approved experts quoted in the piece made the case that, under President Donald Trump, the White House preferred to use economic incentives and punishments like sanctions to confront national security threats by starving them of funding. Under Biden, military violence superseded the sanctions policy, they claimed.“During the Trump era, the US tended to use economic sanctions against Iran and did not politically engage with Iran. Nonetheless, the pro-establishment Democratic government wants to resume the Iran nuclear deal, but it is telling Iran not to take action in Syria, as they are two different issues,” one of the experts said.The Global Times added that its experts expected Biden to attempt to “push European countries to get involved in Middle Eastern affairs” rather than attempt to unilaterally handle threats to America.The Chinese government formally condemned the strikes through its Foreign Ministry.“We call on relevant parties to respect Syria’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and avoid further complicating the situation in Syria,” spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters Friday in response to questions about the strike.China has largely abstained from interference in the Syrian Civil War or other conflicts in the greater Middle East, though it has established a permanent military presence in Djibouti, an African country with close proximity to Yemen. It maintains friendly relations with the government of Iran and, thus, its proxy, dictator Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and with the government of Russia, which has flooded Syria with military assets to defend Assad.The United States, through at least three presidents, has called for Assad to step down from power and urged a peaceful solution to the Syrian civil war. The majority of its involvement in the country has been to fight the Islamic State, a former proxy of al-Qaeda that once established its “capital” in the Syrian city of Raqqa. American forces, with the aid of Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters, liberated Raqqa in 2017.The airstrikes on Thursday reportedly targeted only PMF-affiliated forces. The PMF fought against the Islamic State in parts of Syria and Iraq. In 2017, top Pentagon official Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend said, “Iraqi militia forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, and the [U.S.-led] global coalition also deserve a share of the credit for their sacrifices to achieve this hard-won victory.”The Pentagon confirmed to Breitbart News that Townsend included the PMF in that praise.The PMF are intensely anti-American and have refocused much of their efforts to attacking U.S. troops and assets, particularly in Iraq where they are formally part of the military. The attack Biden used to justify his strikes was a bombing of American assets in Iraqi Kurdistan last week, for which a small militia known as the Saraya Awlia al-Dam, or “Guardians of Blood Brigades,” took credit. The group is believed to be part of the PMF. The Agence France-Presse (AFP), citing American and Iraqi officials, described the group as a “smokescreen” for KH and other jihadists in the PMF.Last week’s bombings accidentally destroyed part of the Chinese consulate in Erbil, Iraq. Wang, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, did not mention that detail in his call for an end to American activity against the PMF.According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a non-governmental organization (NGO), the Biden airstrikes killed at least 17 people. PressTV, an Iranian propaganda outlet, claimed only one person died and four others were injured as a result of the strikes.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaIsrael / Middle EastNational SecurityChinacommunismIranIraqJoe BidenKata’ib Hezbollah (KH)Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)Syria.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
462,"The Chinese state propaganda outlet Global Times attacked Korean pop (K-pop) superstars BTS on Wednesday in response to a report that Big Hit Entertainment, the band’s record label, used a map in a corporate report that did not show parts of India as parts of China.The Global Times and other Communist Party media arms have repeatedly attacked BTS, or Bangtan Sonyeondan, for similar alleged insults to the Chinese people. While the latest example is an indirect attack on the group, Beijing condemned BTS itself in October for thanking the American people for their contributions in the Korean War.BTS is arguably the most popular musical act in the world. Late last year, the group became the first Korean artists to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the first receive a Grammy Award nomination. Their single “Dynamite” has spent 26 weeks on the Hot 100 chart; they sold over 9 million albums in 2020.China has not escaped BTS’s global popularity, even though China banned most South Korean entertainment from entering the country amid a dispute with Seoul over the U.S. military placing anti-missile assets in the country to protect from a potential North Korean attack. Their return to the airwaves last year prompted a surge in interest and enthusiasm for the group that also fueled sales of BTS branded products to such a point that, while initial rumors claimed that Beijing had banned the items, the companies making them admitted they had merely sold out.Failing to stop the band’s momentum, Chinese media have taken to promoting a Party-approved reality television program that will create what Beijing hopes to be the world’s most popular boy band. The program, Chuang 2021, has attracted no international interest.The Global Times claimed that “netizens” — the Communist Party’s term for social media users who spread Party-approved opinions online — were outraged at Big Hit Entertainment for not properly recognizing “South Tibet,” a region of India that China has unsuccessfully claimed as its own.“South Korean K-pop agency Big Hit Entertainment, which manages idol group BTS, raised eyebrows among Chinese netizens for using an incorrect map that failed to indicate South Tibet as part of China, but instead showed it as Indian territory,” the Global Times alleged.In reality, “South Tibet” is an Indian territory known as Arunachal Pradesh, which borders Chinese-occupied Tibet. Beijing and New Delhi have disputed where the true border between the states is for decades, most recently resulting in military clashes along the expansive border. India increased its troop presence in Arunachal Pradesh last year in response to an attack by Chinese troops elsewhere on the border — in the Galwan Valley, part of India’s Ladakh region. China also claims territory there and alleged that Indian troops crossed into China illegally; the Indian government accused China of trespassing. In either case, Indian and Chinese soldiers challenged each other’s positions in the valley last June, resulting in a brawl featuring attempted stoning and beatings with sticks wrapped in barbed wire. According to Indian media at the time, India lost 20 troops to the fighting, while China lost 40. China refused to acknowledge any casualties in the incident until last week, when Beijing claimed to have lost only four troops.Big Hit’s offending map reportedly appeared in the company’s seasonal financial report. Most other news outlets noted the content of the report: 2020 was Big Hit’s most lucrative year ever and 36 percent more profitable than 2019. The record label made $716.4 million in sales revenue and increased its operating profit by 44 percent year-over-year. Global Times focused instead on the “incorrect” map, claiming a pro-China “blogger” uncovered it and caused a stir on Communist Party-approved social media.“A blogger who found that the map excluded South Tibet from Chinese territory later posted the issue in a discussion group on Chinese social media platform Douban,” the state outlet reported. “In the post, the blogger reminded the company to review and correct the map, so as not to arouse hostile sentiment between people on both sides.”“The incorrect map irritated many Chinese netizens,” the propaganda newspaper claimed, citing anonymous quotes allegedly taken from Chinese social media. The Communist Party bans all opinions and people it disapproves of from the social media platforms available to the general public.The report concluded by calling Big Hit a “repeat offender” against China, citing remarks by BTS member RM last year praising the United States.The initial offense occurred in October, when BTS became the youngest-ever recipients of the James A. Van Fleet Award, which the Korea Society gives to honor “distinguished Koreans or Americans in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the promotion of U.S.-Korea relations.” BTS’s popularity in the United States, the Korea Society noted, had greatly elevated interest in South Korea and strengthened the nation’s cultural ties.“The Korea Society’s 2020 Annual Gala is especially meaningful, as this year marks the 70th anniversary of the Korean War,” RM, one of the group’s members, said in an acceptance speech, delivered virtually in light of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. “We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women.”America and South Korea fought side by side in the active portion of the Korean War, from 1950 to 1953. As no peace treaty has ever been signed, the war remains ongoing, through hostilities have largely ended. America and South Korea fought against China and North Korea.Despite China’s status as the enemy against South Korea in the Korean War, the Global Times protested that RM had not thanked China similarly to the way he had thanked Americans for their solidarity.“Many Chinese netizens pointed out that the speech plays up to U.S. netizens, but the country played the role of aggressor in the war,” the Global Times claimed at the time, quoting alleged “former fans” who complained that “thousands of Chinese soldiers … sacrificed their lives in the war.” The fans omitted that the Chinese soldiers were killing South Korean soldiers while in service.Chinese state media claimed BTS products had “disappeared” from Chinese e-commerce sites and that Chinese nationalists were abandoning the band. Less than two weeks later, the Global Times admitted that, in reality, the products had sold out because the band was too popular in China, then accused those covering Beijing’s outrage of sensationalizing China’s objections.Unlike global brands like Marriott, Gap, and Versace, neither Big Hit nor BTS has apologized for RM’s comments or conceded in any way that Beijing’s outrage was justified.Chinese media have since announced plans to build its own, Party-friendly boy band through the reality show Chuang 2021. Unlike the band it appears designed to replace, the program has received little to no international attention. The Global Times nonetheless claimed Sunday that it had “become a hot topic on social media platforms both at home and abroad.”“On Twitter and YouTube, videos of these trainees’ singing and dancing performances on the show have gone viral,” the newspaper claimed, without providing any engagement data. “Thai fans have been flocking to social media to show support for two Thai trainees Nine and Patrick.”BTS remains so popular among Chinese people that Chinese fans painted large murals in the city of Gwanju, South Korea, slated to stay up for two years, this month to celebrate the birthday of band member J-Hope.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter. AsiaEntertainmentNational SecurityBig Hit EntertainmentBTSChinacommunismGlobal TimesIndiaKorean WarSouth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
463,"An in-depth study of Biden’s “weakness” on China from the Republican Study Committee (RSC) contains background information on Burns’ affiliations with prominent CCP members. According to the report, while Burns was president of the board of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he welcomed Zhang Yichen to the board. Zhang is a Chinese businessman linked to two major CCP organizations, the Chinese People’s Political Consultive Conference and the Center for China Globalization.Zhang’s firm, along with the China-U.S. Exchange Foundation, an organization connected to the CCP and responsible for “United Front” work in the U.S., gave Carnegie millions of dollars to help build the think tank’s Beijing-based Carnegie-Tsinghua center.If confirmed by the Senate, Burns would be the first CIA leader whose experience is largely from the State Department, where he served under both Republican and Democrat presidents. He rose through the diplomatic corps ranks to become deputy secretary of state before retiring in 2014 to run the Carnegie Endowment of International Peace.While at the State Department, Burns helped negotiate former President Barack Obama’s 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which failed to stop the regime’s desire to weaponize its program. Instead, the deal paved the way for them to do so legally in the future. Former President Donald Trump canceled the deal.After Trump took office in 2017, Burns held his tongue until 2020, when he began writing highly critical pieces of the Trump administration’s policies in Foreign Affairs and other publications. Burns has been a staunch advocate of “rebuilding and restructuring the foreign service,” positions he shares with Biden.“Ambassador Burns will bring the knowledge, judgment and perspective we need to prevent and confront threats before they can reach our shores,” Biden said. “The American people will sleep soundly with him as our next CIA director.”AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsCCPCentral Intelligence AgencyChinese Communist Party (CCP)nomineeSenateU.S. State Department.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
464,"A Chinese court has ruled that the printing of the words “homosexuality is a psychological disorder,” which appeared in a university textbook used in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, was “not an error,” Chinese state media outlet the Paper reported Thursday.The Suqian Intermediate People’s Court of Jiangsu Province rejected an appeal by a plaintiff referred to as Xixi (a pseudonym) on February 22 and upheld the original hearing’s judgment, which found the printing of “homosexuality is a psychological disorder” in a textbook published by Jinan University Press in 2013 “was an academic point of view and a divergence of understanding, and it was not an intellectual error in the scope of book editing.”Xixi, a then-20-year-old Chinese university student, sued the Chinese publisher Jinan University Press and its retail platform in 2017 after she learned that homosexuality was described as a disorder in a psychology textbook the publisher printed. A court in Jiangsu province first heard her case in July 2020.The textbook in question, titled Mental Health Education for College Students, was publicly selected for use in a Jinan University course in the Chinese province of Guangzhou in 2016. Its 2013 edition classified homosexuality as “a disorder in sex or the perversion of the sex object,” according to the Paper.The Chinese government officially dropped homosexuality from its list of psychiatric disorders in 2001. The Chinese Psychiatric Association said at the time it would consider homosexuality a part of “normal” sexual behavior “with the proviso that those who are unhappy with their sexual orientation may still be judged to be in need of psychiatric help.”State-controlled publishing houses publish most university textbooks in China, making it difficult for citizens to successfully challenge their content. A Chinese college student named Qiu Bai took China’s education ministry to court three times in 2015 and 2016, accusing the bureau of failing to address her complaints against allegedly “anti-LGBTQ+ terms used in academic textbooks.” Like Xixi, Qui also sued university textbook publishers for allegedly printing that homosexuality is a mental disorder.“Since 2001 when homosexuality was declassified as an illness in mainland China, 40 percent of the psychology and mental health teaching materials published on the mainland say homosexuality is an illness,” Qiu claimed.Although Qui’s suit was heard, her efforts to sue China’s Ministry of Education ultimately proved unsuccessful.China’s longest-running gay pride event, “ShanghaiPRIDE,” was canceled indefinitely in August 2020. The event’s organizers did not provide a clear reason for the cancellation but suggested that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic may have been a factor in the decision to call off the gathering.“China decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from a list of mental disorders in 2001. But same-sex marriages are still illegal, there are unspoken rules on censorship of LGBT topics, and discrimination runs deep in many aspects of society,” the South China Morning Post noted when reporting on ShanghaiPRIDE’s cancellation.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinahealthhomosexualitymental disordersmental healthpsychology.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
465,"In one corner are the 15 leading Olympic sponsors, many household names like Airbnb, Coca-Cola, Visa, Toyota, Samsung and General Electric. Together they pay at least $1 billion to the International Olympic Committee, and in the next four-year Olympic cycle the payments could reach $2 billion.They are tied together by Beijing’s 2022 Winter Olympics, which opens in just under a year. Sponsors want the Olympic connection, but they risk damaging their brand because of reported human-rights abuses against Muslim Uyghurs, Tibetans and other minorities in China.In the other corner is a small core of international lawyers and activists. They have branded these the “Genocide Games” and are pressuring sponsors, the IOC and world sports federations to investigate.Thousands of Olympic athletes are caught in the middle. For most, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime chance for fame and a medal. But they’re on their own. Those who speak out may be banned by Olympic bodies, dropped by sponsors, and threatened by the Chinese state.“It’s not fair that these huge institutions who can speak out are going to leave it to the individual athletes to do this,” Blair McDougall, campaign director for the British-based Stop Uyghur Genocide, told The Associated Press. “The governing bodies could speak out, the sponsors, the IOC.”Instead, there is silence.“Once again athletes are being used as pawns,” said Rob Koehler, director general of Global Athlete, an advocacy group for Olympic athletes.Human-rights groups have initially targeted Airbnb and CEO Brian Chesky. The World Uyghur Congress and other advocates for Uyghurs and Tibetans have previously called for moving the games, or some type of boycott.“Airbnb describe themselves as a company that talks of having an ethos,” McDougall said. “So far they have ignored us.”To grab attention, campaigners have designed a mock-ad linking Airbnb to the internment camps and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Although sponsors account for about 18% of the IOC’s income, 73% comes from selling broadcast rights. The American network NBC accounts for about half of the broadcast income.This will be Beijing’s second Olympics in 14 years, following the 2008 Summer Games that were supposed to improve human rights in China. These Olympics landed in China after several European bidders withdrew over costs and public opposition. The IOC was left with two choices: Beijing or Almaty, Kazakhstan. Beijing won in a narrow 44-40 vote.“Our direct request of the sponsors is simple,” McDougall said. “Meet with the Uyghurs and people who have survived the network of camps so that you are not complicit in the use of the games in silencing the issue; in being used as a propaganda tool to distract from what’s happening.”AP contacted the three Japan-based sponsors. Toyota’s reply was typical in regard to the internment of Uyghurs in northwestern China. Panasonic did not immediately respond, and Bridgestone sent a form letter from the IOC.“As for the recent situation in Xinjiang, we are not in the position to comment on it,” Toyota said in a statement.McDougall contacted the World Curling Federation, which initially responded by blocking him on social media. He said they have since lifted the block “but have gone silent.”“They’ll be getting pressure not to be the ones who break the dam of silence,” McDougall said.London-based human-rights lawyer Michael Polak filed a complaint with the IOC ethics commission over Beijing’s “breaches of the Olympic charter.” Instead of responding to his brief, the commission referred him to a statement from IOC President Thomas Bach.The charter in Principle 6 under “Olympism,” prohibits discrimination “of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.”Polak plans to follow up with Ban Ki-moon, the former United Nations secretary general and the chairman of the IOC ethics commission. The commission itself is not independent of the IOC, but Polak believes it should be.The IOC has often repeated its position: it simply runs a sports events and “has neither the mandate nor the capability to change the laws or the political system of a sovereign country.”IOC spokesman Mark Adams declined an Associated Press request to make Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr. available for an interview with a journalist and a human-rights lawyer. Samaranch leads IOC preparations for Beijing. In a recent interview with China’s state-run Xinhua news agency, he called progress for the games “truly remarkable.” Bach called the preparations “almost a miracle.” Neither has commented in public about the camps or the abuses, or used the word “Uyghurs.”Samaranch is the son for former IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. He also helps to run the Samaranch Foundation in China. The foundation says its purpose is to promote “Olympism.” One program listed on its website is dedicated to “safe driving and healthy sports” in Xinjiang, the region where internment camps are located.Polak said it’s impossible for the IOC to guarantee that elements used in the games — souvenirs, technology to time races, or clothing — were not produced by Uyghur “forced labor.”“Because the supply chain is so muddy in China, it’s very likely that when an athlete crosses the finishing line, it will be the same technology that China uses to track Uyghurs,” Polak said.Canada’s House of Commons on Monday voted 266-0 in a non-binding referendum that China is committing genocide against more than 1 million Uyghurs and called for the IOC to move the Olympics from Beijing. The Dutch parliament passed a similar motion on Thursday saying the treatment amounted to genocide.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he believes genocide is being committed against the Uyghurs.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian responded to Blinken: “The most important thing should be repeated three times: China has no genocide; China has no genocide; China has no genocide, period.”Polak pointed out that the United Nations Genocide Convention spells out much of the behavior taking place in China.“Internationally there is no dispute that crimes against humanity are taking place,” Polak said. “Whether it amounts to genocide, there are some arguments. Although most people seem to now accept it does reach the stage of genocide. That’s in regard to preventing births and also separating children from families.”Polak said having the games might inadvertently benefit the Uyghurs. Television coverage will highlight the rights abuse, and athletes speaking out could be critical. Athletes are pushing for that right with changes to the IOC’s Rule 50.“In some ways, the Olympics going ahead is almost better for the cause in terms of the world’s attention on what’s happening to the Uyghur people,” he said. “And not just the Uyghur people, but suppressed Christians, Tibetans and others.”AsiaPoliticsSportsBeijing Winter OlympicsChinaChinese Communist PartyInternational Olympic CommitteeIOCUighurs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
466,"Chinese dictator Xi Jinping announced Thursday that China had achieved “complete victory” against poverty, claiming not a single person among the nation’s 1.4 billion people was poor.Xi asserted that this meant the Communist Party had achieved its “first centenary goal” of creating a “moderately prosperous society” by 2021.The declaration — similar to a claim in November that China had defeated “extreme poverty” — follows a year in which China reached record levels of exports and greatly outperformed most world economies, in part due to the effects of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. China also faced, however, significant threats to its food supply in the past year and water shortages in the nation’s south — threats that Beijing has not yet fully eradicated and that call into question the claim that not a single individual in China lived in poverty. The biggest threat to the nation’s food supply last year was extensive flooding in almost the entirety of the Chinese heartland, destroying key crops and leaving farmers with nothing to sell.Thousands of people reportedly lost their homes and all their belongings as recently as September to floods, raising questions as to how they could not be counted among the poor four months later.The Chinese state-run publication Global Times branded Xi’s declaration that poverty no longer existed in the country a “great miracle in the human history of poverty reduction.”“China is expected to declare a moderately prosperous society in all respects in the middle of this year, which means that the country has achieved its first centenary goal on schedule in 2021,” the propaganda outlet explained. “In 2049, China will achieve its second centenary goal of building ‘a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced and harmonious.'”Xinhua, another Chinese government news agency, offered Communist Party statistics that allegedly proved the end of poverty.“Over the past eight years, the final 98.99 million impoverished rural residents living under the current poverty line have all been lifted out of poverty. All the 832 impoverished counties and 128,000 impoverished villages have been removed from the poverty list,” Xinhua claimed, asserting “770 million impoverished rural residents have shaken off poverty when calculated in accordance with China’s current poverty line” since the 1970s.The 832 “impoverished counties” were also allegedly removed from Communist Party statistics in November, when Xi first declared the war on poverty was over. At the time, the Wall Street Journal, questioning the announcement, noted, “a report this year from former World Bank officials said that if a uniform standard of $5.50 a day in income, or around $2,000 a year, were applied, some 373 million or about 27% of the population would be considered in poverty.”The Chinese government’s metrics differ from many standard world metrics on measuring poverty, such as the one World Bank uses.China’s economy did enjoy significant successes in 2020, however. Its trade surplus globally hit a record high in light of the fact that many nations almost completely shut down manufacturing in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. China’s was the only major world economy to grow rather than shrink in the past year.“China is the first major economy worldwide to achieve positive growth, and its GDP in 2020 is expected to step up to a new level of 100 trillion yuan [$15.3 trillion]. China has seen a good harvest in grain production for 17 years in a row,” Xi said in remarks celebrating the news in December.Xi’s modest boast of a “good” harvest contrasted significantly with his more exuberant celebrations of the Chinese economy but was nonetheless a notable comment given the extensive destruction of Chinese crops through flooding in 2020. Flooding affected 27 of 31 provinces at the peak of the rains and affected over 38 million people. To protect larger structures, particularly the prodigious Three Gorges Dam, Chinese villagers accused the government of deliberately flooding their communities, opening streams into communities to relieve water pressure.Chinese officials repeatedly denied that the destruction of farmland had affected the nation’s food supply, even as Xi Jinping announced a nationwide campaign to urge people to eat less. The “Clean Plate” campaign, which remains in vigor, is allegedly a response to growing food waste at celebratory events and on social media videos showing people, often thin women, eating large amounts of food for entertainment. The resulting laws from the “Clean Plate” campaign spanned far more than regulating online content, however, imposing limits on how much individuals can eat at large events like weddings and regulating restaurant portions.“The initiative initially sparked speculation by some media over whether China is in a food crisis,” the Global Times noted last year, refusing to affirm that this was a factor. “Experts say the world indeed faces a food shortage, but for China, the real threat to food security comes more from food wastage than epidemic or floods.”This week, the Chinese Agriculture Ministry published a future plan to secure national grain supplies. At a press conference announcing the plan, Agriculture Minister Tang Renjian “stressed that the country’s grain supply at times comes under pressure, saying that domestic demand of grain will continue to rise in the long run due to population growth,” according to state media.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaEconomyNational SecurityChinacommunismfood supplypovertyXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
467,"The Taliban issued an official statement Tuesday warning leaders in the terrorist group they will face internal punishment if they allow non-Afghan citizens into the group or otherwise “harbor” them.The statement follows repeated warnings from the administration of President Joe Biden that Washington may not keep its promise to withdraw fully from Afghanistan by May if the Taliban does not adhere to the two major promises it made in a peace deal with the prior Trump administration: to stop harboring members of international terrorist groups, particularly al-Qaeda, and to stop attacking U.S. soldiers.The Pentagon recently observed one year without U.S. military deaths in Afghanistan, partly due to the peace agreement brokered by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year. The Taliban has significantly refocused its attention to attacking the legitimate government of Afghanistan, resulting in minimal American casualties but escalating violence hurting Afghan security forces.The Taliban considers itself the legitimate government of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” and has repeatedly refused to negotiate with Kabul, whose leaders it deems imposters.The Taliban directive, published in part by Afghan news outlet Tolo News on Tuesday, appears to be a response to Western experts stating that evidence suggests that Taliban has not sufficiently distanced itself from global jihadist groups.“All heads and mujahedeen are directed to avoid arbitrary move to bring in foreign nationals into their ranks or harbor them,” the statement read, vowing that those caught harboring foreigners “will be referred to the military affairs commission for further punishment.”The Taliban strictly enforces the implementation of sharia, or the Islamic law, among its ranks and forced the entire Afghan nation to live under sharia when it ruled the country. The statement did not specify, other than having their battalions defunded, what “punishment” those who continued to harbor foreigners would face.Tolo News noted that the United Nations estimated that up to 500 members of al-Qaeda were active in Afghanistan, cooperating with the Taliban. The Taliban has a hostile relationship with the Islamic State – an al-Qaeda offshoot – that has escalated as its Afghan wing, the Khorasan province, has attempted to conquer opium-growing territory traditionally held by the Taliban.Under an agreement brokered last year, the United States agreed to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan – ending the two-decade-old war – in exchange for the Taliban ceasing attacks on American soldiers and cutting ties with foreign troops. That withdrawal appears in jeopardy, as the Biden administration has issued statements suggesting that the Taliban had not lived up to its end of the deal sufficiently for Washington to feel that a withdrawal was safe and judicious.The most recent statement of doubt regarding the withdrawal came from Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin last week, addressing NATO. The United States invoked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty to request that NATO help invade Afghanistan in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.A readout of Austin’s statement to NATO read in part, “[Austin] reassured Allies that the U.S. would not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan,” a message many interpreted to mean that the end of the Afghan war was not imminent for the United States.Prior to Austin’s remarks, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby accused the Taliban of breaking the peace deal and appeared to urge reporters to leave space open for a potential change in the deadline. “We are still involved in trying to get a negotiated settlement. The Taliban have not met their commitments,” Kirby said in January. “As you know, there is a looming deadline of early May … but without them meeting our commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan National security forces and by dint of that the Afghan people, it’s very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.”The Taliban responded to those signals last week by issuing an open letter to America asking its troops to leave.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [the Taliban] is sincerely committed to finding a political solution to the ongoing conflict and therefore, took the initiative by opening a political office in the nation of Qatar towards this end,” the head of the Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, wrote. “Now that a year has passed since the signing of the Doha agreement, we urge the American side to remain committed to the full implementation of this accord.”

468,"Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm announced Wednesday that Phase III clinical trials found their Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate to be 72.51 percent effective in preventing infections.The number is significantly higher than the only Chinese-made vaccine widely approved internationally, “Coronavac” by the company Sinovac, which studies found to be 50.38 percent effective. It is still significantly lower than the vaccines produced by American pharmaceutical companies. Studies show the first vaccine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), from Pfizer, to be about 95 percent effective in preventing infections. The second, by the pharmaceutical company Moderna, was found to be about 94.1 percent effective.Chinese state media has repeatedly attacked the Pfizer vaccine, citing Communist Party-approved experts urging the world not to approve it, while declaring Coronavac “good enough.”According to the Chinese state outlet Global Times, the Sinopharm vaccine candidate – tested in Wuhan, the origin location of the Chinese coronavirus – requires two doses to achieve its 72 percent efficacy. It uses inactivated viral cells, a different method than the mRNA process used by Pfizer and Moderna. The Chinese government approved the Sinopharm vaccine on Wednesday.“So far, data from the trials shows that the vaccine can trigger high-titer antibodies in recipients. The neutralizing antibody positive conversion rate reached 99.06 percent after two shots, according to the institute,” the state media outlet reported.Like Sinopharm, Sinovac initially claimed that its vaccine candidate was highly effective. Initially, Sinopharm’s development partners in Brazil, the Butantan Institute, claimed the vaccine candidate had a 78 percent efficacy. The company later clarified that the number “only included volunteers who suffered mild to severe cases.” The vaccine was only about 50 percent effective in general including those individuals who became infected and contracted “very mild” cases of coronavirus, developers said.“The vaccine was able to 100 percent prevent severe illness in such a high-risk population, and effectively control the morbidity, and protect at least 50% of people from infection, which is good enough,” a Chinese government-approved infectious disease expert told the Global Times in January.The American vaccines have proven through several studies that they can prevent infections more efficiently than the Chinese options. The reportedly less effective American vaccine, Moderna’s, protected 94.1 percent of people participating in its trial after a second dose. Pfizer’s protected recipients at a 95 percent rate.More recently, a study by the Mayo Clinic published this week found the first shot alone of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines had up to an 83 percent efficacy. The study echoed findings from the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, which found the Pfizer vaccine to be 75 percent effective two to four weeks after recipients received the first dose.A third American vaccine candidate, by the New Jersey company Johnson & Johnson, is also in development. The FDA announced on Wednesday it found the Johnson & Johnson candidate had “a favorable safety profile with no specific safety concerns” with 66 percent efficacy. Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna options, the vaccine candidate requires just one dose and does not need to be frozen. The Moderna vaccine requires securing in freezing temperatures. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored between -80ºC and -60ºC (-112ºF to -76ºF), though the FDA may soon approve temperatures possible in standard freezers.In contrast to its forgiving coverage of the Chinese vaccine candidates, the Global Times has repeatedly published stories questioning the safety of the Pfizer vaccine. The Times has accused the vaccine of threatening the health of the elderly – who many nations have prioritized for receiving vaccinations – and quoted Chinese health experts urging Western nations not to administer it.Last week, the Global Times claimed that government-approved “experts” “believe it’s [the Pfizer vaccine] too risky and pregnant women should not get any vaccination for trials.”The newspaper condemned Pfizer studying the effects of its vaccine on pregnant women, claiming that “netizens,” or social media users whose opinions the government has approved, “questioned whether it’s ethical to run tests on pregnant women.”Multiple reports and eyewitness testimonies indicate that the Chinese Communist Party regularly forces pregnant women to undergo abortions if they belong to persecuted ethnic groups or have already had their legally allotted two children.Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group, which owns Sinopharm, announced in December it would purchase 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine from the American company’s European partner, BioNTech.A poll released this week shows less than half of China’s health care workers want to take the Chinese coronavirus vaccine.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityScienceBioNTechChinacoronavirusJohnson and JohnsonModernaPfizerSinopharmSinovacvaccinationVaccine.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
469,"Sri Lanka recently revealed it ceded physical control of its Hambantota Port to China in 2017 not just on a 99-year lease, as previously reported, but also with a provision to extend the lease for an additional 99 years.“[T]he previous government made a mistake on the Hambantota port deal when they canceled the lease and gave it on a longer period of 99 years plus another 99 years once the first term ends,” Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena told the Sri Lankan newspaper Ceylon Today on February 20.“There is a provision for a further 99-year extension of the lease,” Gunawardena added.Ceylon Today asked Gunawardena if the clause is mentioned in the Belt and Road Initiative “Memorandum of Understanding” (MoU) agreement signed by Sri Lanka and China to initiate their joint infrastructure projects. Beijing has launched BRI projects worldwide as a means of increasing China’s global influence in recent years.“Yes,” Gunawardena answered. “It says the 99-year lease can extend for a further period. Which means it can go on for any number of years after 99 years or for another 99 years.”The Chinese foreign ministry denied China’s lease on Hambantota Port extends to nearly 200 years when asked about the Ceylon Today article at a regular press conference on February 24.“The relevant report runs counter to facts,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told the Press Trust of India.“The concession agreement relating to the Hambantota Port is a mutually beneficial one signed by China and Sri Lanka in an equal-footed and voluntary spirit through friendly consultations,” Wang said.A Chinese state-owned firm seized control of Hambantota Port in late 2017 on a 99-year lease after the Sri Lankan government defaulted on its previous BRI loans from China to develop the port. Observers viewed Sri Lanka’s handover of a strategic Indian Ocean port to China as a serious threat to the island nation’s sovereignty.The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), General Daya Ratnayake, told Ceylon Today on February 6 that Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was “revisiting” the Hambantota port deal.“We are revisiting the proposal even now. It was unfortunate and such a deal on Hambantota Port shouldn’t have been done. But the review process is going on,” he said.Sri Lanka’s president recently negotiated with Chinese government officials so they would allow the island’s military to relocate a Sri Lankan naval base from the Chinese-controlled section of the port, Ratnayake revealed.“The Navy Base, according to the agreement, was on the Chinese leased land. The President spoke to the Chinese and took the base to the Sri Lankan side,” Ratnayake said. “Hereafter, the Sri Lanka Navy will take control of the entire maritime area, under the supervision of the Sri Lanka Government.”“Our security is now taken back for Sri Lanka in Hambantota Port,” the SLPA Chairman affirmed.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsBelt and Road Initiative (BRI)ChinaHambantota seaportSri Lanka.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
470,"Authorities in Western China’s Xinjiang region are formally prosecuting ethnic Uyghurs at a higher rate than in previous years, and have increased the length of prison sentences for the Turkic minority group native to the Central Asian territory, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported on Wednesday.Xinjiang courts sentenced over 99,000 people in the Uyghur-majority region in 2017 and over 133,000 in 2018, according to Chinese government statistics cited by HRW, a non-governmental organization (NGO). The Chinese government has yet to release Xinjiang’s 2019 or 2020 sentencing statistics.Human Rights Watch said it analyzed “nearly 60 of these cases” and found many people appear to have been convicted and imprisoned by Chinese authorities without evidence they had committed a genuine criminal offense.“These formal prosecutions are distinct from those arbitrarily detained in unlawful ‘political education’ facilities,” HRW noted, referring to Xinjiang’s state-run detention camps.The Chinese government has allegedly detained an estimated 1 to 3 million Uyghurs in these concentration camps –which it refers to as vocational or “political education” centers – since it launched a crackdown on the Turkic-speaking, Sunni Muslim minority group in 2016 citing concerns about the spread of Islamic extremism and terrorism within the community. Xinjiang borders Central Asia and is referred to by Uyghurs as “East Turkestan.”“Although the Chinese government’s use of ‘political education’ camps has led to international outrage, the detention and imprisonment of Xinjiang’s Muslims by the formal justice system has attracted far less attention,” HRW’s senior China researcher, Maya Wang, said in the report.“Other available information concerning 51 cases, including the indictments, incarceration notices, leaked official documents, and official communications with families indicate most of the Uyghur and Kazakh individuals in these cases have been imprisoned for vague and overbroad offenses,” the authors of the HRW report added. The stated offenses include “inciting ethnic hatred”; “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”; and “watching or listening to extremist content.”HRW also noted a “dramatic increase” in the number of people assigned lengthy prison sentences in Xinjiang in 2017.“Prior to 2017, sentences of over five years in prison were about 10.8 percent of the total number of people sentenced. In 2017, they make up 87 percent of the sentences,” the NGO wrote.The average prison sentence for Uyghurs between 2016 and 2018 was 12.5 years, according to the Xinjiang Victims Database. The NGO based the estimate on an analysis of 312 people in Xinjiang who were assigned prison sentences during the two-year period, excluding the six people assigned life prison sentences during that time.During the February 16 CNN town hall, President Joe Biden justified the concentration camps saying, it is how dictator Xi Jinping keeps the country “unified.”AsiaNational SecurityChinaconcentration campsHuman Rights WatchUyghursXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
471,"The director of a Chinese social development think tank recently proposed unmarried Chinese women over the age of 27 — known as “leftover” women or sheng nu in China — should embrace the surplus of single men in rural China to find a husband, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday.“Leftover” women — most of whom reside in Chinese urban centers and are highly educated — should not “feel afraid to go and live in rural villages,” according to Wu Xiuming, the deputy secretary-general of the Shanxi Think Tank Development Association, a non-governmental organization in central China specializing in social development research. He further suggested that Chinese government officials encourage urban women to migrate to rural areas to find husbands by offering programs that incentivize the move.Wu and other Chinese social development researchers have suggested the matchmaking scheme as part of an overall push for the Chinese government to address a worsening social crisis in China caused by a decades-long gender imbalance. The gender imbalance is rooted in China’s only recently defunct one-child policy, which the Communist Party of China (CPC) implemented in 1979 in an effort to control China’s then-rapidly growing population. CPC authorities relaxed the policy, which encouraged selective abortions for females in favor of the preferred male sex, in late 2015 to allow families to have up to two children. Nearly four decades of the scheme’s enforcement severely warped China’s gender demographics, producing one of the most unbalanced sex ratios in the world.China’s population today counts roughly 30 million more men than women, or 114 males for every 100 females, according to the international data provider Statista. The global average sex ratio at birth is about 105 males for every 100 females, according to the World Health Organisation.China’s gender imbalance is most acutely felt today in the country’s rural areas; women have increasingly abandoned rural communities in recent years for urban centers to pursue educational and career opportunities. The exodus of women from rural villages has left men in the communities with limited marriage prospects. These men are likewise referred to as “leftover men,” or sheng nan.“The gender structural problem should be addressed as soon as possible. For example, [the government should] train rural leftover men on vocational skills and transport them to regions or industries with a high density of women,” Liu Xuan, a 26-year-old migrant worker from rural Dancheng county in Henan province, told the Xinhua Daily Telegraph last week.Liu said he had gone on ten blind dates since the age of 19 in his quest to find a wife but had yet to secure a bride.“Boys in our village have to queue up for blind dating, but girls can be picky,” Liu told the newspaper, a daily publication of China’s official state press agency, Xinhua.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinamarriagePopulation.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
472,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) concluded Chinese officials did “little” to investigate the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus and were uncooperative with international investigators during the first eight months of the pandemic, according to an internal document written in August which the UK Guardian made public on Tuesday.The document viewed by the Guardian was the executive summary of a travel report prepared by a W.H.O. team that met with Chinese officials last summer.“Following extensive discussions with and presentation from Chinese counterparts, it appears that little had been done in terms of epidemiological investigations around Wuhan since January 2020. The data presented orally gave a few more details than what was presented at the emergency committee meetings in January 2020. No PowerPoint presentations were made and no documents were shared,” the report said of those meetings, which lasted ten days.The tenor of this internal document was quite different than what W.H.O. officials were saying in public at the time, as the Guardian pointed out. W.H.O. representatives generally described the Chinese as cooperative and referred to ongoing investigations in China that apparently were not actually happening. The recently concluded W.H.O. visit to Wuhan, China, has also been controversial, with some team members reporting the Chinese inexplicably withheld valuable raw data, while others say they were satisfied with the information they were given. The Chinese furnished some analysis of the Chinese coronavirus’s origins to the W.H.O. investigators but refused to present the data and samples they employed in their studies. The document obtained by the Guardian states that as of August 2020, the Chinese were not doing much to trace the coronavirus, which makes the value of the analysis they gave to W.H.O. investigators in early February even more questionable.W.H.O. gave a statement to the Guardian that tepidly admitted China’s efforts to trace the origins of the coronavirus were subpar and inconsistent with W.H.O.’s practices:“In July 2020, [the] WHO was invited by the Chinese government to send a preliminary team to China to prepare for the work of the team of international scientists. The joint team of Chinese and international scientists began virtual meetings in the autumn of 2020.”The WHO spokesperson added: “They visited Wuhan in January-February 2021. In the early days of an outbreak, the absolute priority is to save lives, understand the disease and suppress the transmission. But we also believe that the work to understand the origin of any outbreak should start early, when certain clues can be found more easily.”In future, the spokesperson said, conducting studies into the origins of a disease should happen in parallel with urgently suppressing a virus and saving lives.The Biden administration has been surprisingly critical of the W.H.O. mission to Wuhan, strongly implying the investigation was not sufficiently “credible, open, and transparent.”“They’re about to come out with a report about the origins of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, that we have questions about because we do not believe that China has made available sufficient original data into how this pandemic began to spread both in China and eventually around the world,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacoronavirusJake SullivanWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
473,"The daughter of current Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Sara Duterte, is the Philippines’ top choice for president in 2022, followed closely by boxer-turned-senator Manny Pacquiao, according to a recent survey conducted by the Philippine polling firm OCTA Research.OCTA surveyed 1,200 Filipinos face-to-face from January 26 to February 1, asking them which presidential candidate they would vote for if the Philippines’ next general election, slated for May 2022, were held today.About 22 percent of respondents answered Sara Duterte for president, followed by “Sen. Grace Poe with 13 percent, Sen. Manny Pacquiao and former Sen. Bongbong Marcos with 12 percent each, and Manila Mayor Isko Moreno with 11 percent,” CNN Philippines reported on February 23.Sara Duterte currently serves as the mayor of Davao City on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao — a post her father Rodrigo Duterte held for decades before being elected president of the Philippines in 2016 — while Pacquiao is known globally as a legendary and still-active professional boxer. Rodrigo Duterte has previously expressed a desire for Pacquiao, a close ally of the president, to succeed him as the Philippines’ top leader.“I told him while we were alone, I want you to become president,” Duterte said during a speech at Pacquiao’s 39th birthday party in Manila in December 2017.Pacquiao was elected president of the Philippines’ ruling political party PDP-LABAN on December 2 in what observers viewed as a preparatory step towards his rumored run for president in 2022. Sara Duterte told Reuters last month that she did not plan on running for president of the Philippines in 2022, despite persistent speculation that she will succeed her father in the role. The president of the Philippines is elected to a single, six-year term, meaning Rodrigo Duterte is ineligible to run for re-election after his term ends in May 2022.“I am not being coy nor am I doing a ‘last-minute,’” Sara Duterte wrote in a text message to Reuters on January 14.“If the whole country does not want to believe (this) then I can’t do anything about it. Not everyone wants to be president. I am one of them,” she said.“I thank all of them for their trust and confidence in what I can do but my refusal to run for president is not the end of the world,” Sara added.Reporters asked Pacquaio if he plans to run for president of the Philippines in 2022 at a press conference held shortly after he was sworn as PDP-Laban’s new leader on December 2.“Let’s not talk politics. We should focus on helping our hungry countrymen, the poor and [those who] have no shelter. The elections are still far away, let’s not talk about it,” Pacquiao replied.“To be given this rare opportunity to lead the PDP-Laban is an immense honor and responsibility.

474,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told allies at the NATO defense ministerial on Thursday that the administration of President Joe Biden would not “undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan,” suggesting a reconsideration of the May 2021 withdrawal date set by predecessor Donald Trump.American armed forces will mark 20 years in Afghanistan in October 2021 in the event that Biden does not withdraw.The Trump administration negotiated a peace agreement with the Taliban last year in an attempt to end America’s presence in the country. The deal would see American forces leave Afghanistan in May 2021 if the Taliban committed to ceasing its attack on the U.S. military and cut its ties to international jihadists groups like al-Qaeda. The Taliban agreed to the deal and has largely appeared to keep the first promise, but international observers have found little indication that the jihadists have attempted to end their relationship with similar groups. Taliban attacks on Afghan government forces have also increased as attacks on Americans have fallen.Both the Taliban and the U.S. government have accused each other of failing to meet their commitments. This week, the head of the Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, published an open letter to the American people urging U.S. forces to leave.NATO reaffirmed its commitment to Afghanistan this week. New Zealand, an allied nation that responded to America’s call to arms in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, withdrew its last remaining forces in the country this week.Austin, according to the Defense Department’s readout of his remarks, told fellow NATO defense chiefs that America would not abruptly end its presence in Afghanistan, presumably even if Washington had previously committed to withdrawing by a certain date.Austin “told the Allies that the U.S. is conducting a thorough review of the conditions of the U.S.-Taliban Agreement to determine whether all parties have adhered to those conditions,” the readout read. “And he made clear that he is committed to consulting with Allies and partners throughout this process.”“He reassured Allies that the U.S. would not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan,” the statement continued.Austin appeared to make similar remarks regarding the Biden administration’s position in America’s presence in Iraq, stating that the administration is committed to “the enduring defeat of ISIS, respecting Iraq’s sovereignty, and ensuring long-term regional stability.” Austin “welcomed” the news that NATO would soon send thousands of more troops into Iraq in response to a rocket attack on Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), this week. Unlike in Afghanistan, the Trump administration did not make any prior commitments to leaving the country, particularly in light of the increasing influence of Iran-backed militias forming part of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a Baghdad-approved coalition. A PMF member guerrilla took responsibility for the Erbil attack.Austin joins others in the Biden administration who had indicated that Biden may not feel comfortable committing to a withdrawal from Afghanistan by may. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby accused the Taliban in January of having broken the peace agreement, making a full withdrawal difficult for Washington.“We are still involved in trying to get a negotiated settlement. The Taliban have not met their commitments,” Kirby said at the time. “As you know, there is a looming deadline of early May … but without them meeting our commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan National security forces and by dint of that the Afghan people, it’s very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.”Kirby insisted that withdrawal from Afghanistan would be “driven by our security requirements.”On the ground, Gen. Austin S. Miller, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, told Reuters last week that any peace process would be “very, very difficult” if the Taliban did not scale back its violence, which has increased towards Afghan forces though not directly towards Americans.The Taliban officially refers to itself as the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” and considers itself the only legitimate government of the country. It deems the true government of Afghanistan a usurper institution and, despite agreements with the United States, has largely refused to negotiate with Kabul.Baradar, the head of the Taliban, nonetheless urged Washington to withdraw from Afghanistan as soon as possible in a letter this week.“Now that a year has passed since the signing of the Doha agreement, we urge the American side to remain committed to the full implementation of this accord,” Baradar said, referring to the agreement with the Trump administration. “We are fully confident that the Afghans themselves can achieve the establishment of an Islamic government and enduring peace and security through intra-Afghan dialogue.”
Baradar claimed that the Taliban is “sincerely committed to finding a political solution to the ongoing conflict.” He notably failed to emphasize that the Taliban have repeatedly insisted in the dissolution of the Afghan government and its return to power as part of that “political solution.”The Taliban is believed to control at least half the territory of Afghanistan and wield power over more than half the population.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAfghanistanjihadLloyd AustinNATOPentagonradical islamTaliban.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
475,"India’s active coronavirus caseload fell to under 150,000 on Tuesday, which amounts to 1.34 percent of the nation’s total number of recorded cases of the Chinese coronavirus to date, India’s health ministry said.“There are 147,306 active cases of the coronavirus disease on Tuesday morning, lower than 150,055 reported on Monday morning,” the Hindustan Times reported on February 23, citing Indian health ministry data.Active coronavirus cases had increased by 4,421 on Monday morning to climb back over 150,000 for the first time in 17 days, marking the steepest rise in active cases since late November.“A total of 10,584 new infections and 13,255 recoveries were recorded in a span of 24 hours” from Monday to Tuesday, however, “leading to a net decline of 2,749 cases in the total active caseload.”The number of new coronavirus deaths in India on Tuesday “remained below 100 for the thirteenth time this month,” according to India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which “underlined that a steady decline is being observed in the number of daily new [coronavirus] deaths,” the Press Trust of India reported.Indian health officials recorded 13,255 discharges of coronavirus patients between Monday and Tuesday morning, meaning the total number of recovered coronavirus patients in India increased to 10,712,665 by February 23. India’s coronavirus recovery rate is currently 97.24 percent, according to India’s health ministry.Indian state health officials said Tuesday that 11,745,552 people in the country have received a Chinese coronavirus vaccine since New Delhi launched a nationwide coronavirus vaccine campaign on January 16. The program aims to vaccinate at least 300 million people in India, which has a population of 1.4 billion, making the vaccine rollout the largest in the world.India has prioritized 30 million doctors, nurses, and other front-line healthcare workers to receive coronavirus vaccinations first, followed by 270 million others, who are either over age 50 or have underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to the Chinese coronavirus than the rest of the population.India’s steadily declining coronavirus caseload has caused many people in the country to feel less urgency to receive a coronavirus vaccination, including doctors and healthcare workers. A community health worker in the southern Indian city of Kollam who spent months urging people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus through door-to-door visits “skipped her appointment to get her first dose of the vaccine after a hectic day on February 12,” Time magazine reported last week.“I don’t feel the need to rush because the worst is over,” A. Valsala told Time on February 19.“So there is a sense that it is okay to wait and watch since there are concerns about how these vaccines were developed so fast,” the healthcare worker added.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinese coronaviruscoronavirusCoronavirus vaccinehealthIndia.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
476,"The Communist Party of China, through its embassy in Ottawa, accused Canada of genocide on Tuesday in response to the nation’s parliament voting to recognize China is committing genocide against its Muslim-majority ethnic groups.Human rights activists and researchers have compiled extensive evidence that the Communist Party has built over 1,000 concentration camps for its Uyghur population in western Xinjiang, a region where Mandarin, the language of Beijing, is not commonly spoken and one to which the nation’s Han ethnic majority are not indigenous to.Survivors of those camps have testified to being forced to endure a long list of human rights atrocities including torture, systematic rape, screening for live organ harvesting, and slavery. Women have accused Beijing of forcibly sterilizing them or killing their unborn children and newborns.China insists that the camps are “vocational training” centers where poor locals receive a free education to help them find jobs. It has not yet explained why so many Uyghurs and other ethnic minority people with successful careers and advanced educations seem to find themselves enslaved in the camps.The Canadian Parliament issued a non-binding resolution on Monday affirming that, in its opinion, the actions the Communist Party has taken in Xinjiang constitute genocide. Leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the vast majority of his cabinet abstained from the vote.China’s embassy in the country responded to the vote by asserting that Canada, not China, is guilty of genocide.“Talking about genocide, Canada should put its hand on its heart and reflect on the tragic history of its indigenous people,” a spokesman for the embassy reportedly said, according to China’s state-run propaganda outlet Global Times.The comment appeared to be a reference to Trudeau’s multiple formal apologies to Canada’s indigenous communities for historical wrongs attributed to the Canadian government. In 2017, Trudeau apologized to indigenous children separated from their families to receive government schooling under a policy that lasted over a century. Two years later, Trudeau apologized to Inuit people for “colonial” policies against them.“We are sorry for forcing you from your families, for not showing you the respect and care you deserved. We are sorry for your pain,” Trudeau said at the time.Trudeau has been accused of participating in several instances of racism in which he donned “blackface,” face paint used to mock people of darker skin. In addressing the incident, Trudeau admitted that he had used blackface so many times that he did not remember them all.Despite its extremely offensive nature, blackface has also repeatedly surfaced in Chinese government entertainment, most prominently in an annual Lunar New Year variety program broadcast by government-run CCTV.Addressing Canada’s condemnation of China’s genocide of Uyghur people, the Chinese embassy spokesperson added that “Xinjiang-related issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion, but about anti-violence, anti-terrorism and anti-secessionism,” arguing that Uyghurs not sent to the camps are prone to engage in terrorism. China has made this claim for years without offering evidence to back the idea that Uyghur people are more susceptible to terrorist indoctrination than Han people.The Chinese embassy spokesperson also accused lawmakers voting in favor of recognizing the genocide “hypocritical and shameless.”“Canada’s move will not succeed and we urge those politicians to recognize reality and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs, stop seeking personal interests through Xinjiang affairs and stop its anti-China farce,” the spokesperson concluded.A decisive majority of Canadian lawmakers voted on Monday to recognize the genocide in Xinjiang, though Trudeau and most of his cabinet were noticeably absent from the vote. No lawmakers voted against the genocide declaration. In recognition of the genocide, the parliament also urged the Canadian government to boycott the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, a move that human rights advocates around the world have been promoting as a gesture of solidarity for not just Uyghurs, but multiple ethnic minorities persecuted systematically in the country.The Canadian parliament declaration follows affirmations by both former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his successor, current Secretary of State Antony Blinken, that China’s actions in Xinjiang constitute genocide. Since Blinken made remarks calling the abuses against Uyghurs genocide in January, however, President Joe Biden has undermined his remarks, claiming dictator Xi Jinping deems the persecution of Uyghurs necessary for a “united, tightly controlled China.”Pressure on the Communist Party to cease its persecution of people in Xinjiang has increased since the publication of a BBC report in which eyewitnesses went on the record with the abuses they endured in China’s concentration camps. While prior reports had accused China of systematic rape of women, some testimony in the article was new, particularly the accusation that Chinese guards use electric batons to rape and shock women simultaneously. The report also affirmed prior accusations of forced abortions and sterilizations practiced on non-Han women.China has responded to the accusations by calling every concentration camp survivor sharing their experiences a hired actor.

477,"Chinese state media boasted of China’s massive military buildup over the weekend while simultaneously claiming Beijing wants nothing more than to renew friendly dialogue with the United States under the Biden administration.China’s state-run Global Times reported Sunday that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has developed “a new type of training system that would improve military training in all respects, strengthen the capability to win wars and build the Chinese military into a world-class one.”The Global Times did not discuss the system, approved by dictator Xi Jinping — whose many titles also include Chairman of the Central Military Commission — in detail, but the article hinted it would include some combination of real-world combat drills and high-tech simulations. The goal is to “train as if exercises are real wars, boost joint exercises, enhance training with technology, strengthen talent support and follow patterns and laws of training and winning wars.”A Chinese military expert whom the Global Times quoted said the new training regimen will combine “training with real combat, to the extent that the two need to be highly identical.” This has been the fundamental goal of all serious military training throughout human history, so it is interesting that Chinese state media felt the need to brag that its soldiers are really digging in and learning how to be killers now.The article included a sideswipe at the supposedly more warlike United States, combined with extensive self-flattery of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a peace-loving organization:Unlike the US military, which has operated around the globe and has been constantly in battles, which means it retains its sharpness, China has not fought a real war for decades, so training is one of only a few ways to hone combat capabilities, and that is why high-quality training is very important to the Chinese military, another Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Sunday on condition of anonymity.The new military training system aims to eliminate malpractices that have accumulated through prolonged peace to make the military more ready for engaging in wars, even if China never wants any, the anonymous expert said.The day after the Global Times touted this new super-warrior program for the PLA, it quoted Foreign Minister Wang Yi claiming China wants nothing but peaceful dialogue with the new American administration:“Over the past few years, the US basically cut off bilateral dialogue at all levels. And this was one of the main reasons for the deterioration in China-US relations,” Wang Yi said in his address to the Opening of the Lanting Forum on Promoting Dialogue and Cooperation and Managing Differences: Bringing China-US Relations Back to the Right Track. “We urge the US to stop smearing the Communist Party of China and China’s political system, stop conniving with or even supporting the erroneous words and actions of ‘Taiwan independence’ forces, and stop undermining China’s sovereignty and security on internal affairs concerning Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet,” Wang added, listing four places whose residents would strongly dispute the idea that the gentle and peaceful CCP is only just beginning to learn how to fight wars effectively because it loathes violence.Wang laid out the price the Biden administration must pay to restore friendly dialogue with the CCP, including the end of “restrictions on Chinese educational and cultural groups, media outlets and institutions” and “obstructions for the US’ local governments and social sectors to engage with China.”The rest of the Global Times article was filled with Chinese experts who insisted the burden of restoring friendly relations lay upon the U.S., since the Trump administration was so aggressive at blocking CCP technology theft, protecting American institutions from CCP cyber-threats, shutting down CCP espionage operations in the United States, and investigating the CCP’s influence on American higher education.“To right the wrongs and bring the China-U.S. relation back to the right track, the walls of misperceptions must be torn down first to clear the way for knowing, observing and understanding China,” Wang demanded, as quoted by the Global Times. The truth is that China was seen much too clearly by the previous administration. Beijing wants the Biden administration to restore all of the old illusions.AsiaNational SecurityChinaChinese Communist PartyHong Kongmilitary drillspeople's liberation armyTaiwanTibetXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
478,"The province of Guangdong, China, unveiled a plan this week to increase its population by 1 million people a year, resulting in a population of 130 million people by 2035, but offered no details as to how it plans to do so.The attempt at rapid population growth appears to be targeting China’s plummeting birth rate, which appears not yet to have hit its bottom as the factors contributing to the fall — a population sorely lacking in women of child-bearing age and little cultural desire for big families following decades of mandatory abortions and sterilizations — have yet to be addressed properly.The Chinese Communist Party imposed a “one-child” policy on its Han majority population from 1979 to 2015. Women found “illegally” pregnant were forced into abortions they did not want; many had their infants killed if they managed to give birth without getting caught. Many families, preferring a boy, killed their newborn daughters, resulting in a gender disparity that has severely impaired China’s current aspirations towards increasing the birth rate. As of 2015, when the one-child policy ended, China had 24 million more men than women.The Chinese government estimates the “one-child policy” “prevented” 400 million people from existing by either killing them or sterilizing women who would have otherwise had children.The South China Morning Post reported Tuesday that Guangdong’s provincial officials published a proposal to increase the region’s population by 13 percent between 2019 and 2035. Guangdong is a southern province close to Hong Kong and its capital, Guangzhou, one of the nation’s most prominent economic hubs. It is also home to one of the largest African migrant populations in the country — and some of the nation’s most overt racism. At the height of the regional pandemic last year, Guangzhou restaurants began banning black-skinned people from eating there and landlords began evicting black tenants, despite no indication they were unable to pay their rents.“The report did not say how the provincial government expected its population to increase amid falling birth rates,” the Morning Post noted. “However, some cities in Guangdong have taken steps to relax residency permit requirements — the hukou system that ties workers to their hometowns — to attract new talent.”The newspaper speculated that much of the proposed growth would come from other parts of China, not from increased birth rates or immigration. Guangzhou, the regional capital, had already expanded permissions to move to the city for college-educated young people. The hukou system strictly regulates where in the country Chinese citizens can relocate to if they wish, and each province gets to decide in part what limitations to place on internal migration. Individuals with low “social credit scores,” like political or religious dissidents, do not get to travel at all.The Morning Post, citing research on Chinese population changes, predicted the plan would not reach its goals, in large part due to Chinese citizens’ lack of desire to start families. Birth rates have been declining for at least a decade but hit a new low in Guangzhou in 2020.The has pattern repeated itself nationwide. China’s National Bureau of Statistics estimated a 15-percent drop in births between 2019 and 2020, significantly larger than the decline between 2018 and 2019. Many experts have attributed this in part to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which in China resulted in extreme lockdowns in which families were, in some cases, welded shut in their homes.“The low birth rate in China has reached an alarming degree, but it is not a surprise,” a Chinese government-approved expert told the state-run Global Times this month.Another state outlet, China Daily, hinted at the failure of the two-child policy, noting that allowing twice the number of births nationwide had not actually produced more children.“Simply allowing a couple to have a second child does not mean they will have one, as the costs of raising children, escalating housing prices and mounting career pressures on women dampen couples’ desire to have more children,” the publication noted, calling the decline “irreversible.”The decline in births has not moved the Communist Party to change its current family planning policy, the “two-child policy,” which still mandates abortions or infanticides in cases of illegal births. Instead, extensive evidence has come to light showing that China is systematically sterilizing women who belong to ethnic minorities, particularly those of Uyghur background. Uyghurs are not subject to the two-child policy.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational Securitybirth rateChinacommunismGuangdongGuangzhou.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
479,"Hong Kong’s population declined last year for the first time since 2003, the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department said Thursday.Hong Kong recorded 7.47 million residents in 2020, a 0.6-percent decrease from 2019, according to the census bureau’s annual population report, released February 18. The number of deaths surpassed the number of births in the city last year, causing a “natural decrease” in population for the first time since 1961. The number of residents who left Hong Kong surpassed the number of people who moved to the city as well, resulting in a “net outflow.”“A natural decrease of 6,700 was recorded for the first time in 2020, with 43,100 births and 49,800 deaths. Meanwhile, a net outflow of 39,800 persons was recorded during 2020, with an inflow of 10,100 One-way Permit holders and a net outflow of 49,900 other Hong Kong residents,” the report stated.
“Largely due to the border control and quarantine measures in place in Hong Kong and other places around the world, as well as the severe interruption of international travel amidst the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic, we see a substantial drop in the inflow of people into Hong Kong,” a city government spokesperson said on February 18.Hong Kong applications for a “certificate of no criminal conviction” – a document typically required to immigrate to most countries – surged by 43 percent year-on-year in 2019 to 33,000, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. The figures for 2020 are not yet available.China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in June 2020 that undermined the city’s semi-autonomy, which it had been allowed under the terms of its return to Chinese rule from Britain in 1997. The security law was Beijing’s answer to a year and a half-long protest movement in the city decrying Chinese encroachment on Hong Kong society. The legislation increased Hong Kong border security and caused an overall decrease in immigration to the city from China; the flow of Chinese migrants to Hong Kong has contributed at least 1.5 million residents to the city’s population since 1997.The national security law likewise forced many Hong Kong residents to flee the city last year, with many heading for Britain. The U.K. announced in late January that it plans to welcome as many as five million Hong Kong residents who choose to leave the city in the coming months.“[H]olders of British National Overseas passports—which are available to Hong Kong citizens born in the territory before it was handed back to China in 1997—can move with their families to the U.K. on five-year visas. After that period, they can apply for British citizenship. Previously these passport holders could only get six-month British visas,” the Wall Street Journal reported on January 29.AsiaImmigrationNational Securitybirth ratedeclining populationemigrationHong KongimmigrationNational Security lawPopulationpopulation decline.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
480,"Chinese state media released a video over the weekend purporting to depict fighting between Chinese and Indian border troops in the Western Himalayas’ Galwan Valley in June 2020.At least four Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers died in the clash according to the video, marking the first time China’s military has publicly admitted to the deaths. Beijing had previously confirmed only that at least one Chinese PLA soldier died in the border brawl, which also killed at least 20 Indian troops.Indian media, citing government sources, reported at the time as many as 40 Chinese soldiers died in the brawl, over twice the number the Indian military lost.China’s Central Military Commission issued commendations to the fallen PLA servicemen “for their role in bravely fighting back hostilities provoked by foreign forces at the Galwan Valley,” a PLA newspaper reported on February 19, according to China’s official state press agency, Xinhua.“The title of ‘border-defending hero’ was conferred to [PLA] Battalion Commander Chen Hongjun posthumously, while Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran received first-class merit. They all died in a clash with trespassing foreign military personnel wielding steel tubes, cudgels and stones last June,” Xinhua relayed.“Qi Fabao, who was seriously injured in the skirmish, received the title of ‘hero regiment commander for defending the border,'” according to the report.“[T]he Indian side has repeatedly sensationalized and hyped up this incident with the casualties and distorted the truth to mislead the international public opinion,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a press conference on February 19. “Now, as the PLA Daily reveals the truth on the matter, people will have a better understanding of what really happened and who is right and who is wrong.”China and India share an unmarked border in the Western Himalayas; a bilateral agreement prevented either side from using firearms along the boundary meaning the June 2020 border clash was largely fought hand-to-hand. The skirmish was the deadliest military dispute between India and China since the two sides fought a border war in 1962. India revoked limits on the use of firearms on the border following the incident.India and China accused each other of provoking the June 2020 skirmish both on the day of the clash, June 15, and in the preceding weeks. Both sides alleged that the other had recently violated the border’s integrity through increasing intrusions into the other’s territory in the months leading up to the clash.A voiceover in the February 19 PLA propaganda video claims that Indian border forces “frequently crossed the borderline to build bridges and roads in an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo of the border control, escalating tensions in the area” starting in April 2020, alleged actions India previously claimed China had committed during the same time frame.“They are setting up a tent there and now they are bringing in another one,” a Chinese PLA voice-over in the video claims, with the accompanying footage purporting to show the alleged border violation by India.“In June 2020, the foreign military force blatantly violated the consensus reached between the two sides and crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) [the official name for the India-China border] in provocation,” the narrator continues, over footage of what appears to be dozens of Indian troops crossing a river holding shields with the word “Police” written across them in one hand and batons in the other.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsborder disputeChinaGalwan ValleyHimalayasIndiapeople's liberation army.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
481,"Beijing’s assault on what little remains of Hong Kong’s autonomy continued Monday with the announcement of new rules to ensure that only “patriots,” meaning solid loyalists to China and its Communist Party, will be eligible to govern the island.China’s state-run Global Times hailed the “patriots governing Hong Kong” initiative as an urgently needed effort to fix “loopholes” in the island’s political system, describing it as an “upgrade” to the “one country, two systems” principle of limited autonomy to which China agreed when it took control of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997.The Global Times noted this “systematic upgrade,” like the authoritarian “national security” law imposed on Hong Kong last summer, would be implemented through the National People’s Congress in Beijing rather than “proposed by the HKSAR [Hong Kong Special Autonomous Region] government and then approved by the central government.”Later in the article, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office chief Xia Baolong explained how the “patriots governing Hong Kong plan,” like the national security law, is a ham-fisted effort to crush the pro-democracy movement that spread across Hong Kong in 2019:Hong Kong experienced severe political turmoil in 2019 when anti-government rioters used scorched earth strategies to paralyze the city in pursuit of their political goals. Some secessionists and extreme anti-government forces spread secessionist ideas, opposing the authority of the central government, instigating dissatisfaction toward the mainland and recklessly interfering in the governance process of the HKSAR government, forcing society as a whole to pay a heavy price for it. Xia attributed the earlier chaos in the city to the lack of full-scale implementation of the “patriots governing Hong Kong” principle, which has also become a major urgent task, for which the Chinese official also laid out a series of basic standards including the idea that patriots truly safeguard their country’s sovereignty, security and development interests.Also, there have been certain specific descriptions laid out for those “who are and who are not patriots,” for example, those who attack the central government in a hysterical manner, openly advocate for “Hong Kong independence” and beg for foreign sanctions against the city certainly are not patriots.“Patriots love the country, more specifically, the People’s Republic of China,” the Global Times explained.Xia expounded on that idea, insisting Hong Kong patriotism is synonymous with absolute loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and dictator Xi Jinping, as quoted by the South China Morning Post (SCMP):“Different political opinions are allowed in this country which implements socialist democracy, but there is a red line: one should never do anything that harms the country’s fundamental system; that is, to do something that harms the socialist system led by the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.“The CCP is the creator and leader of the ‘one country, two systems’ model. Isn’t it contradictory for someone who claims to safeguard [the model] to oppose its creator and leader?”Xia said steps had to be taken to effectively prevent those who “oppose China and undermine the stability of Hong Kong”, as well as “agents of anti-China forces” in overseas countries, from taking up positions in the city’s organs of political power, describing it as a “major issue of principle related to the success or failure of the cause of one country, two systems.”Xia magnanimously allowed that some older Hong Kongers might need help understanding how China works because “after living in a capitalist city for so long,” they do not “know their nation well.”Hong Kong’s current chief executive, Carrie Lam — who became immensely unpopular during the 2019 protests and the brutal police crackdown against demonstrators — applauded Beijing’s decree that only “patriots” would be allowed to participate in city government, not “troublemakers.”Lam said Tuesday she understands why officials in Beijing “do not want the situation to deteriorate further in such a way that ‘one country, two systems’ cannot be implemented.”The New York Times (NYT) on Tuesday warned the still-gestating package of patriots-only rules could “block democracy advocates in the city from running for any elected office” and “quash the few remaining vestiges of political dissent after the anti-government protests that roiled the territory in 2019.”Beijing’s most immediate goal appears to be purging critics of the Chinese Communist Party from the 1,200-member committee that selects chief executives. Lam’s five-year term will conclude early next year.“The urgency of the Communist Party’s move suggests a worry that pro-democracy sentiment in Hong Kong is so strong that the party could lose control of the committee unless it disqualifies democracy advocates from serving,” the NYT wrote.Beijing is also expected to establish loyalty committees to review candidates for the Hong Kong legislature and other public offices, ensuring that only China loyalists and solid Communists are allowed to participate in elections. The Hong Kong government on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require more stringent loyalty oaths from district councilors and ban candidates who are “deemed insincere or insufficiently patriotic.”“You cannot say, ‘I’m patriotic but I don’t respect the fact that it is the Chinese Communist Party which leads the country,’” said Erick Tsang, Hong Kong’s secretary for mainland affairs, by way of explaining the defining parameters of “insincerity.”
The SCMP quoted a “government insider involved in the city’s electoral matters” who said September’s legislative elections could be delayed while Beijing rewrites Hong Kong’s electoral laws and implements its “patriot” policies.AsiaNational SecurityCarrie LamChinaChinese Communist PartydemocracyHong Kongprotests.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
482,"Air pollution killed 54,000 people in New Delhi, India’s national capital, last year, Greenpeace Southeast Asia revealed in a study published Thursday.“Delhi sustained an estimated 54,000 avoidable deaths due to PM2.5 [fine particulate matter] air pollution in 2020, or one death per 500 people,” the report stated.Exposure to PM2.5 – fine particulate matter measuring smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter – can cause cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and cancers. New Delhi’s air pollution deaths cost the city’s economy an estimated $8.1 billion last year, which amounts to roughly 13 percent of the city’s annual GDP.New Delhi is home to over 30 million people. It ranks as India’s most populous city and the second-most populated city globally after Tokyo, Japan, and has long been considered one of the world’s most polluted cities. The Indian capital’s air pollutant levels remain nearly six times higher than the prescribed World Health Organization limits of 10 g/m3 annual mean, according to the Greenpeace study.North Indian farmers have long practiced stubble burning – a method of clearing agricultural fields by intentionally burning the organic residue left over after harvesting. North Indian states surrounding New Delhi, notably Punjab, recorded a marked increase in stubble burning last year due to early harvesting. Smoke from the agricultural burns travels to nearby New Delhi and contributes significantly to the capital’s air pollution levels.Other Indian cities were also significantly affected by air pollution in 2020.“An estimated 25,000 avoidable deaths in Mumbai in 2020 have been attributed to air pollution. Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Lucknow estimated an approximate 12,000, 11,000, 11,000, and 6,700 avoidable deaths respectively due to polluted air,” Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s study further revealed.Jakarta, Indonesia, documented “13,000 avoidable deaths due to PM2.5 air pollution in 2020 and sustained air pollution-related losses of USD $3.4 billion, equivalent to 8.2 percent of the city’s total GDP,” according to the report.Of the cities included in the Greenpeace study, “the highest estimated total financial cost from air pollution was recorded in Tokyo, which suffered approximately 40,000 avoidable deaths and an economic loss of USD $43 billion due to PM2.5 air pollution in 2020. Los Angeles recorded the highest per capita financial cost of PM2.5 air pollution of all cities on the estimator, at approximately USD $2,700 per resident.”Exposure to PM2.5 air pollutants killed 160,000 people across the world’s five most populated cities – Tokyo (37 million), New Delhi (30 million), Shanghai (26 million), São Paulo (22 million), and Mexico City (22 million) – in 2020, according to Greenpeace.

483,"Less than half of healthcare workers polled recently in the Chinese province of Zhejiang would receive a Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate after its emergency approval, while just one-quarter of medical workers in Zhejiang are willing to get a coronavirus vaccine once they are available for all people.Zhejiang’s disease control and prevention center (CDC) surveyed 756 healthcare and epidemic prevention workers in the eastern province for the vaccine poll, released on February 18. Just 42 percent of the medical workers polled would get a coronavirus vaccine candidate approved for emergency use by the Chinese government and “fewer still, only 28 percent, said they were willing to get a shot of their own accord once the vaccines were on the market for all,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Friday.The Zhejiang CDC study’s authors said that most people who expressed an unwillingness to be vaccinated cited concerns about potential health side-effects the inoculations may cause. In response, they recommended the provincial government should further educate the public about the “effectiveness and safety” of Chinese-made vaccines.In Shanghai, which borders Zhejiang, the municipal CDC polled 1.8 million residents last month and found that only half of those surveyed would be willing to receive a Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate, according to the SCMP.The two recent Chinese poll results contradict the findings of a study released in December by the World Economic Forum and the market research firm Ipsos. The global survey spanned 15 nations and was conducted between December 17-20 among 13,500 adults.“[V]accination intent is highest in China, where 80 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement ‘if a vaccine for COVID-19 [coronavirus] were available, I would get it,'” the World Economic Forum reported.Chinese health officials recently acknowledged that public confidence in state-made vaccines remains low.“Openness and transparency are the only sure way of countering vaccine hesitancy,” a team of public health experts from the University of Hong Kong wrote in a Chinese national CDC weekly bulletin published last week.“Full and systematic disclosure of data from clinical trials and post-roll-out empirical studies is needed,” they recommended.Chinese state-run pharmaceutical companies have caused several health scandals in China in recent years by manufacturing and selling expired or ineffective vaccines.Chinese authorities have arrested 70 people involved in at least 20 criminal cases for selling fake coronavirus vaccines in recent weeks as part of a nationwide crackdown. One man arrested, identified as Kong, led a multi-million dollar scam in which he passed saline solution and mineral water as Chinese coronavirus vaccines.“Kong and his team made a profit of 18m yuan ($2.78m) by putting saline solution or mineral water in syringes and hawking them as Covid [coronavirus] vaccines since August last year,” the BBC reported on February 16, citing details of a court ruling released this week.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineVaccine.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
484,"The yearly suicide rate for Japanese schoolchildren surged to 479 in 2020, the highest figure recorded since Japan began keeping records of the statistic in 1980, Japan’s education ministry revealed Monday.The number of juvenile suicides in Japan increased by 40 percent in 2020 compared to the previous year. Suicides spiked in the months immediately after schools resumed classes following long-term closures due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, according to a provisional report released by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.“Fourteen of the suicides were elementary school pupils, up by eight from the previous year, while 136 were junior high school students, an increase of 40, and 329 were senior high school students, up by 92,” according to the report.“By month, suicides increased year on year by 24 to 45 in June, by 35 to 64 in August, by 11 to 53 in September, and by 25 to 48 in November,” the Asahi Shimbun reported. Of the senior high school students who committed suicide, “191 were male, up by 21 from the previous year, while suicides among females doubled by 71 to 138.”Concerns over career prospects were reportedly the cause of at least 55 suicides. Poor academic performance was a likely cause of suicide in 52 additional cases. Both reasons are commonly cited for suicide in Japan during conventional years, as the country prizes strong academic and professional achievement. Many of the students who took their lives in 2020 were “suffering from depression and other mental illnesses,” according to the report.Japan’s education ministry held a panel meeting on February 15 to discuss suicide prevention measures moving forward. The ministry said it plans to distribute tablet computers to all elementary and junior high school students in the country to allow authorities to more closely monitor students’ mental health.“(The tablets) can be used to monitor changes in students as they spend longer periods at home, as well as to conduct surveys and check on their stress levels,” a panel member said. “They will play a large role in preventing suicides.”The ministry operates a toll-free suicide helpline in Japan for troubled youth and said it will reinforce efforts to publicize the line. It is also preparing to launch a social media platform to better support students’ mental health through their smartphones.Overall suicide rates in Japan increased 16 percent year on year from July to October 2020. The three-month period coincided with Japan’s second-wave of Chinese coronavirus outbreaks, according to a study by researchers at Tokyo’s Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology and Hong Kong University published on January 15.“People worry about COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus].

485,"Chinese state media did not relent in its attacks on President Joe Biden, publishing a column on Thursday accusing him of attempting to “ring-fence China,” a day after Biden appeared to justify the construction of over 1,000 concentration camps for ethnic minorities in the country.Speaking at a town hall event produced by CNN, Biden claimed that placing Uyghur individuals and members of other Muslim-majority ethnic groups in concentration camps was a way for dictator Xi Jinping to keep the country “unified.” He claimed that he had chastised Xi on China’s litany of human rights abuses, but that the comments were perfunctory, and that Xi “gets it” that Biden is politically obligated to mention the issue.The U.S. government estimates that as many as 2 million people remain trapped in the Chinese concentration camp system as of 2020. Survivors of the camps have testified to outrageous human rights atrocities including extensive torture, rape, evidence of live organ harvesting, indoctrination, and slavery. In a particularly gruesome account published by the BBC this month, witnesses testified to Han Chinese guards using electric batons to rape women and electrocute them simultaneously. Some women said they were forced to tie other women up to beds so that unknown men could come to the camp on a nightly basis and gang-rape them. Extensive evidence has also revealed the use of forced sterilization and abortions on Uyghur women, a tactic international legal experts accept as a form of genocide.The Chinese Communist Party claims the concentration camps are “vocational training centers” for undereducated people and that all witnesses claiming they were abused are hired actors.The administration of former President Donald Trump declared the atrocities committed against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, China, a genocide, an assessment with which Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly agreed. Despite this, Biden himself appeared to justify the measures as necessary to keep China “unified” in the eyes of Beijing.“If you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been the time China has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven’t been unified at home. It’s vastly overstated, but the center of principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China,” President Biden told CNN host Anderson Cooper on Tuesday in response to a question on Biden’s policy on Uyghur abuses. “And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that.”Biden told Cooper that he raised the issue with Xi, but in the context of his concern that he may lose political support if he did not. Biden compared Xi’s presumed obligation to place people in concentration camps to his own obligation to complain about it.“I point out to him no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn’t reflect the values of the United States,” Biden said. “So, the idea that I’m not going to speak out against what he’s doing in Hong Kong, what he’s doing with the Uyghurs in Western Mountains of China, and Taiwan, trying to end the one-China policy by making it forceful. I said, and he gets it, culturally there are different norms in each country, and their leaders are expected to follow.”Biden concluded that China would face “repercussions,” a claim White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki later walked back.The friendly overture did not deter the Global Times, a state-run publication, from running a scathing piece on Thursday claiming that Biden was organizing a nefarious conspiracy to limit China’s influence in the Group of Seven (G7), scheduled to meet virtually this week. The newspaper accused Biden of trying to put “old wine in new bottles” by putting a kinder face on the anti-communist policies of President Trump.“It will not prevail easily as the G7’s perceptions about China are divided and the U.S. cannot fulfill what they need and want,” the propaganda outlet predicted, citing its stable of Party-approved “experts.”“The choreographed appearance in the G7 meeting reflects the essence of the Democratic Party: soft on the outside while hard on the inside,” the Global Times assessed, citing an “expert” who claimed that Biden’s party was dedicated to “besieging China,” without providing any examples.One of the experts consulted, identified as “Wang Yiwei,” stated that any attempt by Biden to convince other nations to oppose human rights atrocities in China would fail because “not all of them see China as the ‘enemy’ such as France and Germany. Even Japan, one of the US’ most important allies in Asia may not view China as an ‘enemy.'”China Daily, another Communist Party propaganda outlet, shifted its focus away from Biden in an editorial published Thursday and instead condemned Blinken, so far the only voice in the Biden administration unequivocally condemning Chinese human rights atrocities. That newspaper took particular issue with Blinken holding a meeting with counterparts in Australia, Japan, and India.“That the Joe Biden administration has taken the initiative to continue promoting the so-called Quad has driven home the message that it is a jackal at home in the former lair of another,” the editorial protested, “the Biden administration has seized the trowel from its predecessor and is mortaring bricks in an attempt to build a seawall with which to protect its regional influence and hegemony.”“If Washington really wants to avoid conflict, it is the one that needs to stop what it is doing and undo what it has already done,” the newspaper advised.The attacks in Chinese media indicate that Biden’s overture to Beijing by justifying acts that his own administration has called a genocide have failed to change the tenor of Chinese diplomacy. China has also failed to recognize or acknowledge its atrocities in Xinjiang. Following Blinken’s statements last month agreeing with Pompeo that China is committing genocide, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian responded by simply chanting repeatedly, “China has no genocide.”The evidence the Han-dominated Chinese Communist Party is committing genocide against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz people, and others in Xinjiang has grown greatly since initial reports of the construction of concentration camps in 2017. The BBC report published this month was unique in the sheer number of people who went on the record with their experiences in the camps.“The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn’t know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock,” Tursunay Ziawudun, a concentration camp survivor, told BBC. “They don’t only rape but also bite all over your body, you don’t know if they are human or animal … They didn’t spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at.”The Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed Ziawudun as an alleged actress and banned the BBC from the nation’s airwaves, calling it a “national security” threat.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinaCNNcommunismconcentration campsDonald TrumpGenocideGlobal TimesJoe BidenUyghurUyghurs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
486,"At least 30 Taliban members died after an explosive device detonated during a bomb-making tutorial in Afghanistan’s northern Balkh province over the weekend, the Defense Post reported on Tuesday.A group of Taliban jihadists gathered at a mosque in the village of Qultaq on February 13 to receive training on how to assemble bombs and improvised explosive devices (IED). An explosive device accidentally detonated, killing at least “30 Taliban fighters including six foreign nationals who were expert mine makers,” according to the Afghan Army’s 209th Shaheen Corps, which confirmed the deadly blast in a statement released Saturday. The bodies of the six Taliban-affiliated foreign nationals were rendered unidentifiable by the blast, according to the statement.The Taliban has not commented on the incident. Such accidental explosions are fairly common in war-torn Afghanistan. A similar blast occurred at a mosque in Balkh’s Chahabar Bolak district in August.“A group of eight Taliban IED experts were busy manufacturing a bomb inside a mosque in Sikandar Khel Village [when a] … premature explosion caused by [the] IED killed four Taliban militants and wounded at least four others,” Afghanistan’s Khaama Press reported at the time, citing a statement by Afghanistan’s Shaheen Corps.“The explosion also destroyed a large cache of explosives and other materials which the group was using to manufacture IEDs,” according to the statement.Taliban militants were again “busy making a bomb” when another such explosion took place in Afghanistan’s eastern province of Andar in April 2020, according to Ava Press. Government officials in Andar’s Ghazni district confirmed that the blast killed at least four Taliban members.“A month later, a bomb exploded in a house in the southern province of Zabul, where a group of militants had gathered to assemble the explosive, leaving the building destroyed and three militants, including the homeowner, dead,” the Defense Post recalled on Tuesday.The Taliban terror group uses IEDs and other explosives to target Afghan government forces and personnel in the conflict-ridden country. The improvised bombings have also killed thousands of Afghan civilians over the past several years.The Taliban refuses to accept the internationally-backed Afghan government as Afghanistan’s legitimate authority and has launched countless attacks on federal security forces in recent years as part of its opposition to the government’s central rule. Peace negotiations between representatives of the Taliban and the Afghan government launched in Doha, Qatar, in September 2020 at the behest of the U.S. government. The talks have repeatedly stalled, however, and failed to produce significant progress between the two opposing parties. The Taliban has continued to carry out deadly attacks on Afghan security forces throughout the negotiations, despite agreeing to a ceasefire during the peace process.AsiaCrimeNational SecurityAfghanistanbombexplosionexplosivesIEDsimprovised explosive devicesTaliban.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
487,"The head of the Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, published an open letter to the United States Tuesday urging it to withdraw its military from Afghanistan, as the administration of President Donald Trump had committed to doing in a peace deal that also required the Taliban to stop associating with international terrorist groups.In exchange for the Taliban distancing itself from al-Qaeda and similar jihadist groups, and ceasing its attacks on U.S. forces, the peace deal brokered by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would have seen American troops fully withdraw from Afghanistan as early as May 2021. President Joe Biden has not committed to abiding by that timeline and his officials have questioned the Taliban’s adherence to the commitments in the peace deal. While the Taliban has diminished their attacks on American forces – U.S. forces marked a year without a combat death in the country in early February – extensive evidence suggests the Taliban has maintained ties with international jihadist groups, including al-Qaeda.The Taliban chief wrote to American leaders:We are fully confident that the Afghans themselves can achieve the establishment of an Islamic government and enduring peace and security through intra-Afghan dialogue.The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan [the Taliban] is sincerely committed to finding a political solution to the ongoing conflict and therefore, took the initiative by opening a political office in the nation of Qatar towards this end.“Now that a year has passed since the signing of the Doha agreement, we urge the American side to remain committed to the full implementation of this accord,” Baradar urged.The Taliban leader also added an assurance that, should Afghanistan return to full rule under the Taliban, the jihadists were “committed to upholding and guaranteeing all rights of women afforded to them by Islamic law.”“We would like to once again assure the international community in this regard,” Baradar insisted.Under the strict implementation of sharia, or the Islamic law, the Taliban severely repressed the rights of Afghan women during their rule, including restrictions on movement, freedom of association, work, education, and nearly every aspect of their lives.The peace deal brokered last year was meant primarily to result in as peaceful a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country as possible but left many key disputes between the Afghan government in Kabul and the Taliban unaddressed. The Taliban do not recognize the legitimacy of the Afghan government and considers itself the true government of the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.” It has transparently asserted its mission to erase the influence of Kabul to the best of its ability and escalated attacks against Afghan forces while diminishing attacks on U.S. troops and civilians.The Afghan government’s negotiating team lamented that talks had taken a turn away from “serious” commitments in remarks this week, suggesting that without the presence of U.S. troops, Kabul and the Taliban are irreconcilable.“The approach that convinced the Taliban is that they have said that the emirate system will return,” meaning the Afghan government would cease to exist in its current state, negotiator Mateen Bek said this week. “[A]nd the Americans are serious about leaving—so what is the need for talks?”Adding more tension to the situation, Edmund Fitton-Brown, the head of a U.N. panel monitoring the Taliban, accused the group on Wednesday of maintaining close ties to al-Qaeda.“We believe that the top leadership of Al-Qaeda is still under Taliban protection … There is still clearly a close relationship between Al Qaeda and the Taliban,” the official contended, according to Afghanistan’s Tolo News. The U.N. estimates that hundreds of al-Qaeda jihadists benefit from Taliban protection in Afghanistan.The United States invaded Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, jihadist attacks orchestrated by al-Qaeda, toppling the Taliban for their role in enabling the terrorist organization and harboring its leader, Osama bin Laden.The Taliban’s refusal to cut ties with al-Qaeda has complicated America’s exit from the war theory, Biden administration officials have warned.“If the violence isn’t reduced, it’s going to make a peace process very, very difficult; it would be very difficult for any side to make the necessary compromises,” Gen. Austin S. Miller, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, told Reuters this week.The State Department has also hinted at the Biden administration reviewing the Trump-era Taliban deal, hinting at a possible exit. Taliban representatives have stated that they remain optimistic Biden will keep the agreement but have threatened further violence if American forces remain in the country past May.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter. AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAfghanistanDonald TrumpIslamic lawJoe Bidenradical islamTaliban.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
488,"A representative of the ruling Chinese Communist Party claimed Friday the sight of American’s suffering in the severe winter storms that devastated Texas and other areas this week is a simple affirmation of a belief among Chinese citizens their country is “on the right path.”Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying offered her stark observation after a state media journalist remarked on calls by western countries for an investigation into human rights abuses in its western Xinjiang region.Reuters reports in response Hua repeated China’s denials of abuse of Muslims in the region, and said in defence of communism that Australia, Canada and the United States had histories of genocide.Then she contrasted the vulnerability of many Texans with the festive experience of Chinese during the recently-completed Lunar New Year holiday.Utility shortages in Texas spread to the state’s water supply as the winter storms continue.

489,"The Chinese Communist Party continued to expand its illegal construction on Philippine territory in the South China Sea throughout the coronavirus pandemic, satellite images published this week indicated.China claims the entirety of the South China Sea, including territory legally belonging to the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Beijing also claims waters off the coast of Indonesia, infuriating Jakarta. A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague found China’s claims to the territory, which the Communist Party argues are based on “ancient” ownership, were not legal, nor was any Chinese presence in regions legally belonging to other countries.China has spent years building artificial islands, now equipped with military assets, in the Spratly and Paracel Islands, which legally belong to Vietnam and the Philippines. Chinese ships have also repeatedly harassed, and in some cases, sank, ships from both countries present in their domestic waters. Neither Hanoi nor Manila have made significant moves to contain China, in part due to the comparatively small size of their militaries.U.S.-based firm Simularity released photos this week from Mischief Reef, a Philippine territory in the South China Sea, showing structures built by China not visible in prior satellite images. China has been building Mischief Reef into an artificial island and equipping it with military technology since at least 2017, causing irreparable environmental damage. It is the largest of China’s artificial islands in the Spratly chain. According to the Philippine media outlet ABS-CBN, China has been attempting to usurp Mischief Reef since 1995, building wooden barracks on the then-much smaller land mass.The Simularity images showed new clearings on the artificial island that experts told the Philippine Star on Thursday were likely spaces for new buildings. The firm estimated that the earliest the new structures visible in the photos were there is likely around October 2020, indicating that China continued illegal construction on the reef throughout the pandemic.“In one area, a satellite image dated February 4 showed construction of a 16-meter permanent cylindrical structure, which is a possible antennae mount structure,” the Star reported. “In several areas on the island, a concrete structure with a large radome cover, possibly a fixed radar structure, was seen.”The latest report did not offer much clarity on the uses of the new construction, or if they are of military or civilian nature. Chinese officials have repeatedly denied that any of Beijing’s activity in the region is military, though satellite images have shown surface-to-air missiles, military surveillance equipment, and other assets placed in the South China Sea.The Philippines took China to the Permanent Court of Arbitration during the presidency of Benigno Aquino III, but won the case against Beijing under current President Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte has proven significantly less assertive against China than Aquino, repeatedly stating that he would not challenge China in the South China Sea because he does not consider the Philippine military strong enough to withstand a war against the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Duterte has refused to enforce the Hague ruling against China, allowing for further construction.“I’m walking on a tightrope actually. I cannot afford to be brave in the mouth against China because we are avoiding any confrontation, a confrontation that would lead to something which we can hardly afford, at least not at this time,” Duterte said most recently in remarks last week, speaking to members of the Philippine Air Force.Duterte has made some public statements reminding China that its presence in the Philippines is illegal despite his assurances that he would never enforce the law.“We must remain mindful of our obligation and commitment to the charter of the United Nations. And as is amplified by the 1982 Manila declaration on the peaceful settlement of international disputes, the Philippines affirms that commitment in the South China Sea in accordance with UNCLOS [U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea] and the 2016 arbitral award,” Duterte told the United Nations General Assembly in 2020.“The award is now part of international law,” he said of the Hague ruling. “Beyond compromise and beyond the reach of passing governments to dilute, diminish, or abandon. We firmly reject attempts to undermine it. We welcome an increasing number of states that have come in support of the award and what it stands for.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaEnvironmentNational SecurityChinacommunismPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteSouth China Sea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
490,"A man in Hong Kong assaulted a McDonald’s employee with his mobile phone on Thursday after the worker asked him to download a coronavirus contact tracing app required to visit businesses amid the pandemic and the man refused.The suspect attempted to enter a McDonald’s restaurant in Hong Kong’s Ngau Chi Wan area at around 6:00 am on February 18, local news outlet HK01 reported. A staff member told the man to use the Hong Kong government’s “Leave Home Safe” app on his smartphone to scan a QR code outside the restaurant or enter his contact information on a paper form before entering the restaurant. City health authorities currently require all Hong Kong businesses to enforce the contact-tracing protocol as part of newly enacted coronavirus restrictions.The suspect, believed to be in his 20s or 30s, “refused to download the app or write down his contact details,” according to the report. He then “entered the restaurant forcibly, but was stopped by the staff [member].” An argument soon sparked between the man and the McDonald’s worker, 26. During the altercation, “the customer used his phone to strike the worker before fleeing.”The victim suffered injuries to his forehead during the physical assault, according to local media outlet Coconuts Hong Kong. The McDonald’s restaurant staff reported the attack to local police who arrived on the scene roughly 30 minutes later but the suspect had already fled the premises. Police later classified the incident as “assault occasioning bodily harm.”“The male employee was conscious after the attack and sent to United Christian Hospital for treatment. Police are still searching for the man,” a Hong Kong police spokeswoman said in a statement, as quoted by the South China Morning Post.The Hong Kong government’s new “Leave Home Safe” smartphone app records the names of businesses frequented by its users, along with the time and date of the visit “and stores the information on their phone for 31 days,” according to the SCMP. Patrons wishing to visit most businesses or restaurants in Hong Kong are required to download and use the app before entering the site. If they choose not to use the smartphone app, they have the option to write down their personal information on paper forms and deposit the document into an on-site drop-box. “Leave Home Safe” app users “will receive an alert if a confirmed case is identified at any of the venues they have visited,” according to the Hong Kong-based newspaper.AsiaCrimeHealthassaultcontact tracingcoronavirusHong KongMcDonald's.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
491,"China’s Global Times state propaganda newspaper featured on its online front page Tuesday a large gathering of migrant workers in Beijing celebrating the Lunar New Year holiday by making dumplings together.Despite a recent outbreak of Chinese coronavirus in the capital that triggered strict lockdowns in dozens of communities — and China’s failure to fully eradicate the virus the way its state media outlets have claimed — the feast appeared to feature communal cooking, singing, only occasional sanitary mask-wearing, and other at-risk activities.The photo report of the event recalled the Chinese Communist Party organizing an attempt at the world’s largest feast, featuring 130,000 people, in Wuhan in January 2020. Wuhan is the source of the Chinese coronavirus and officials there had already documented a raging epidemic situation there when they allowed the banquet to happen.The Global Times regularly condemns Americans and Westerners in general for allegedly not doing enough to protect from coronavirus infection, blaming individualist and capitalist values.“The migrant workers who stay in Beijing due to [Chinese coronavirus] control measures celebrated Spring Festival with a community gala in Pi Village, one of the largest urban villages,” the Global Times reported uncritically in an article published on February 11. “They made dumplings, sang songs and read poems with their children to celebrate Chinese [Lunar] New Year.”Chinese publications refer to the Lunar New Year as “Chinese New Year” despite the fact that many Asian countries and ethnicities observe the holiday.The photos published by the state outlet show unmasked people in a small room, making dumplings by all grabbing filling from a large bowl with their hands. They do not appear to be wearing gloves, nor are containers of anything that may be hand sanitizer visible. The group also appears to be eating “family-style,” sharing plates.Public health experts consider communal eating and not wearing masks properly indoors high-risk activities for contracting coronavirus. Personalities like Dr. Anthony Fauci have also condemned singing indoors as a particularly effective method to spread the virus since it requires deeper breathing. Those singing in the photos the Global Times published are not wearing masks and are clearly in close quarters with their audience.The Lunar New Year feast for migrant workers in Beijing who cannot make it home in time appears to be an annual event, regularly the subject of features in Chinese media.Similarly, Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the pandemic began, holds an annual Lunar New Year banquet, typically targeted at older members of the community whose children or grandchildren live abroad and cannot make it home for the holiday. Last year, the local Wuhan government allowed the organization of a banquet with 130,000 guests despite the local epidemic raging in the city. The banquet reportedly featured 14,000 dishes, an attempt to break a Guinness World Record, eaten family-style.The event occurred in January, when Chinese officials were still telling the World Health Organization they did not have evidence that the virus spread from human to human. In reality, leaked Chinese government data published by the South China Morning Post revealed the first confirmed Chinese coronavirus case was documented on November 17, 2019, giving Wuhan officials months to cancel the banquet. Taiwanese officials had also warned the W.H.O. in December that they had reason to believe the disease spreading in Wuhan was contagious and similar to SARS, another type of coronavirus.The feast in Beijing last week followed a difficult month for the capital, which faced rolling lockdowns in the face of a resurgence of cases that defied dictator Xi Jinping’s declaration of victory against the virus in March 2020. The lockdowns affected 1.7 million people in the capital as well as millions throughout China’s northeast, reaching as far up as Heilongjiang province, one of the most severely affected areas last year. Sporadic outbreaks in the nation’s south, particularly in Hong Kong, also raised questions regarding China’s ability to contain the spread of the virus through depriving citizens of their freedom of movement. Chinese officials insisted that the cases prompting the lockdowns were nearly all “imported” from other countries and have since repeatedly claimed that imported frozen food was a major source of coronavirus infections, a claim not supported by any mainstream public health experts.China has documented slightly more than 100,000 coronavirus cases and fewer than 5,000 deaths, much smaller numbers than comparable nations. Studies have accused the Communist Party, citing China’s initial reluctance to count “mild” coronavirus cases in its tally, of incorrectly documenting the pandemic’s true toll in the country by millions of cases.AsiaHealthNational SecurityBeijingChinacommunismcoronavirusLunar New YearWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
492,"Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the ruling conservative party, announced on Thursday it would consider allowing women to attend top-level party meetings, but not allow them to talk.The announcement appears to be a gesture towards placating women’s rights advocates in the country amid a scandal that erupted after the former head of the committee planning the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Mori Yoshiro, complained that adding more women to Olympic committees would make meetings last too long because of women’s alleged tendencies to speak for too long, extending the length of meetings needlessly.Mori, 83, has since resigned and been replaced by a woman, Olympic medalist Hashimoto Seiko.The incident has nonetheless triggered ongoing outrage towards corporate culture in Japan, which has tended for decades to treat women extremely harshly. Women enjoy less career mobility than men and are typically expected to drop out of the workforce once they choose to start a family, leading to some companies pressuring women to have abortions if they wish to keep their jobs. Many women are also expected not to pursue romantic relationships or build their own families when older family members need tending to, resulting in a drop in marriages and alarming birth rates that Tokyo has yet to reverse.The secretary-general of the LDP, Nikai Toshihiro, also an octogenarian, stated on Thursday that he believed it was “important for them [women] to fully understand what sort of things are being discussed” in high-level party meetings, making it necessary to have some female members of the party attend them. He refused to discuss the potential of women being allowed active participation in those meetings, though unlike Mori he refrained from claiming the reason to be that women simply talk too much if allowed.Nikai did note that a silent, written format would be in place for women to submit comments, but did not note if those comments would be read at the meeting or simply allowed to be placed on the record.The move, Asahi Shimbun reported, was in part a response to former defense minister Inada Tomomi, a woman, urging the LDP to allow women in Japan’s Diet, the national legislature, to attend party meetings.“According to LDP sources, the party is considering letting female lawmakers attend General Council meetings, where the LDP’s policies are formally adopted, and the extraordinary meetings of the Board, where party executives share information,” Asahi reported.The discussion within the ruling party follows several weeks of controversy surrounding Mori’s comments about women. Mori, speaking before the Japan Olympic Committee Council on February 3, claimed women feel outsized pressure to contribute to meetings and become “competitive,” resulting in more talking than necessary.“When someone raises his or her hand and speaks, they probably think they should speak, too. That is why they all end up making comments,” Mori lamented.He attempted to praise the women on the Olympic Committee by stating that, while they were allowed to attend meetings, “they all know how to behave.”Mori apologized and resigned from his position, replaced on Thursday by Hashimoto, who emphasized her experience as an Olympian over her status as a woman in her remarks thanking the committee for the top position.“As a former athlete myself, I believe my mission is to bring about an Olympics that places priority on safety for all participants and to change the mood in society so all athletes can step on their dream stage without any doubts in their mind,” Hashimoto said. “I will seek to accomplish this mission while clearly taking the stance of ‘athletes first.’”Prior to taking the position at the Olympic Committee, Hashimoto was the Japanese government minister in charge of Olympic affairs.Japan canceled the Tokyo 2020 Olympics in response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which greatly limited the ability of most in the world to travel, and is planning on hosting the games in the summer of 2021.Gender disparities in the workplace are considered one of a long list of issues affecting Japan’s dwindling population, which appears to have declined dramatically in 2020 amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Japanese Health Ministry statistics released in February showed a decline in the nation’s population of 420,000, a record in the history of the country and the twelfth year in a row that the population fell rather than grew.“The natural rate of decline — or the difference between births and deaths — was about on par with 2019 during the first seven months of the year,” Japan’s Nikkei reported. “But net foreign arrivals to the country tumbled more than 40% over that period to 115,000 amid entry restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.”The outlet noted that preliminary birth rate numbers showed a 5.1-percent drop in the number of births between October 2019 and October 2020. Japan’s birth rate has been under 1 million births per year since 2016 and dropping every year.Tokyo has attempted to encourage couples to have more children through several programs, including a proposal in 2016 to offer funding for women to freeze their eggs to use in the future should they not wish to drop out of the workforce years. More recently, Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide announced a $19-million government investment into “programs to help residents find love,” which may include the use of artificial intelligence to help single people find partners. At the time of the announcement, half of Japan’s prefectures offered some form of government-organized matchmaking to promote births.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational Securitybirth rateJapanLiberal Democratic Partysexism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
493,"The Chinese Defense Ministry revealed the names of four People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers killed in hand-to-hand combat with Indian troops in June 2020 on Friday, claiming these to be the only casualties in an exchange the Indian government said killed dozens of Chinese.PLA forces and Indian soldiers engaged in the most violent incident between the two states in half a century last year on their mutual border in the Himalayas, formally known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC). According to Indian officials, the nation’s officers found an unexpected group of PLA soldiers establishing camp on territory clearly within Indian sovereign territory in an area known as the Galwan Valley. When confronted, the Chinese soldiers attacked with rudimentary weapons, attempting to stone the Indian soldiers and beating them with sticks wrapped in barbed wire. Indian officials estimated they lost about 20 soldiers and the Chinese suffered double that number of casualties despite the Indian troops being outnumbered. Beijing never issued its own death count or identified any of the troops it lost, stating only that Indian officials were lying.On Friday, the Chinese Defense Ministry finally admitted to the loss of at least four soldiers in the Galwan Valley standoff. It concurred with India in announcing that 20 Indian soldiers had died.“Chen Hongjun, Chen Xiangrong, and Xiao Siyuan fought to the last minute and sacrificed their lives. Wang Zhuoran, a fellow soldier, also gave his life to rescue his comrades when crossing the river to support the others,” China’s state-run Global Times revealed on Friday, relaying the information published by the Defense Ministry. The Communist Party also announced it would award the four soldiers posthumously, and a fifth soldier who suffered injuries but survived, with “first-class merit” awards.In their announcement, Chinese military leaders accused the Indian military of prompting the incident by attacking Chinese soldiers on Chinese land, the opposite of what the Indian military has repeatedly asserted since June. The Global Times also accused the Indian troops, not the Chinese, of using “steel tubes, cudgels and stones” to fight.“In June 2020, the Indian military violated the previous consensus and trespassed the LAC and built tents. Out of respect to previous agreements and rituals, Qi Fabao, regimental commander of the Chinese military, went to negotiate with a few soldiers,” the Global Times narrated. “However, the Indian military showed no sincerity and had already deployed more soldiers in an attempt to force the Chinese soldiers to concede.”The Indian military claimed its local military leader, Colonel Santosh Babu, approached the Chinese forces upon finding them illegally present in the Galwan Valley and faced an immediate assault. Babu was among the first identified deaths in the attack, flung off a steep cliff to his death, according to India. Indian reports claimed most of the deaths were attributable to similar throws or falls or to hypothermia, given the low temperatures in the Himalayan heights.Prior to the incident, Beijing and New Delhi had agreed to ban the use of firearms on their mutual border. The Indian government has since permitted its soldiers to carry firearms in light of the attack,During her regular press briefing on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying claimed that the discrepancy in casualties between the Indian and Chinese reports was because “the Indian side has repeatedly sensationalized and hyped up this incident with the casualties and distorted the truth to mislead the international public opinion.”“The Galwan Valley conflict in June last year resulted in casualties on both sides. The responsibility lies entirely with the Indian side,” Hua insisted.The spokeswoman added that the PLA felt it necessary to make “the truth public” because of Indian “misinformation, but did not explain why it took eight months for China to clarify that it had endured casualties, particularly if it claimed to have suffered fewer of them than the Indian military.The Global Times, in an editorial, did attempt to explain the delay, claiming that current agreements to remove troops and military assets from the LAC have made it safer for China to admit it had lost soldiers.“Back to the Galwan Valley clash last year, given the tense situation at that time, avoiding a comparison of casualties was more conducive to the stability of the border situation,” the editorial alleged. “Now that the round of border standoff has ended, we must make public the heroes’ deeds so that all the Chinese people could admire and commemorate them to understand the weight of peace.”The Global Times insisted that India “suffered heavy losses” in the Galwan Valley clash and boasted, “No one is allowed to infringe on China’s territorial sovereignty and national interests. It’s only wishful thinking if one wants to crash or restrain the PLA.”The Indian government has yet to respond on-the-record to China’s new claims of casualties. In June 2020, Indian officials promptly offered their assessment of the incident, revealing 20 deaths on the Indian side and an estimated 40 for the PLA.“The Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice the casualties [of the Indian side],” retired four-star Indian Army General V.K. Singh said at the time, according to the Hindustan Times. Indian news reports at the time estimated that as many as 600 soldiers from both sides were involved in the attack.Chinese government officials did not admit to any casualties until Friday, but the Global Times described some of the soldiers involved as “martyrs” in an article in September, implying that some had died. The newspaper never elaborated on its use of the term.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismGalwan ValleyGlobal TimesHimalayasHua ChunyingIndiaLine of Actual Controlmilitary.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
494,"The U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment on Wednesday against three North Korean citizens on charges of attempting to steal over a billion dollars through cybercrime, as well as one Canadian-American citizen accused of helping them launder the money.North Korea’s global commerce is severely limited by global sanctions imposed by the United Nations in 2017 in response to its latest illegal nuclear weapons test. In 2020, the communist regime’s ability to fund itself faced even bigger challenges in the face of lockdowns intended to limit the spread of the Chinese coronavirus. While dictator Kim Jong-un has repeatedly claimed North Korea has not documented a single case of Chinese coronavirus within its borders, he tightly sealed the country off from the world, cutting off pivotal trade with China along the Yalu River northern border.The three North Korean citizens charged with a long list of cybercrimes are facing legal processing in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. Prosecutors allege that they were working directly under the auspices of the government of North Korea for its Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), a military entity.U.S. law enforcement officials described the schemes in which the individuals indicted this week were allegedly involved as “a truly unprecedented range of financial and cyber-crimes” that featured both conventional cyber-theft from banking institutions to malicious hacking attacks against American entertainment companies. The individuals named in the indictment — Jon Chang Hyok, Kim Il, and Park Jin Hyok — also reportedly played a role in the 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment in response to the release of The Interview, a Seth Rogen comedy that extensively mocked Kim Jong-un. That crime is the earliest listed in several years of attempts to steal billions of dollars through cybercrime.In the United States, the Department of Justice alleged that the accused had organized multiple online attacks for about four years “that targeted employees of United States cleared defense contractors, energy companies, aerospace companies, technology companies, the U.S.Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Defense.”The three men also stand accused of attempting to steal over $1.2 billion “from banks in Vietnam, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Mexico, Malta, and Africa by hacking the banks’ computer networks and sending fraudulent Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messages,” the Department of Justice noted. The hackers also attempted to steal money by hacking ATMs and allegedly succeeded in at least one scheme targeting Pakistan. That total does not include another about $100 million the accused allegedly stole in cryptocurrency.The men were also alleged to have ties to some of the largest hacking attacks in history, including the 2017 “WannaCry” ransomware attack that affected about 200,000 computers globally. Ransomware prevents a computer from working until the owner of the computer pays a “ransom” to the hackers, potentially yielding extreme profits when used successfully against large institutions that require the computers to function. In this case, the hackers only managed to net about $50,000 as the ransomware did not demand large amounts of money from each computer.“As laid out in today’s indictment, North Korea’s operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world’s leading bank robbers,” Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers of the Justice Department’s National Security Division said in a statement. “The Department will continue to confront malicious nation state cyber activity with our unique tools and work with our fellow agencies and the family of norms abiding nations to do the same.”Acting U.S. Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison for the Central District of California described the list of crimes attributed to the suspects as “staggering.”“The individuals indicted today committed a truly unprecedented range of financial and cyber-crimes,” U.S. Secret Service Assistant Director Michael R. D’Ambrosio added, “from ransomware attacks and phishing campaigns, to digital bank heists and sophisticated money laundering operations.”The three men face a maximum of 35 years in prison.The U.S. State Department, responding in part to interest in the news of the latest indictment, indicated that its cybercriminals activity will form part of the assessment in how to move forward with bilateral ties under the Biden administration. North Korea and the United States are technically at war with each other — neither side in the Korean War ever signed a peace treaty so the war, which began in 1950, is still ongoing — and North Korea continues to consider America its greatest enemy. Under the administration of President Donald Trump, Kim met with an American head of state twice, the first time a North Korean leader had ever done so. The high-level talks, coupled with the strongest sanctions ever placed on Pyongyang, appear to have limited the country’s nuclear weapons testing activity.“Of course, most frequently we speak of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, but, of course, its malicious cyber activity is something we are carefully evaluating and looking at as well,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Wednesday. “I would say that in general North Korea’s malicious cyber activities threaten the United States. They threaten our allies and partners and other countries around the world.”Price also expressed concern not just for cyberthefts, but for the potential of cyber espionage, which could yield intelligence that North Korea could sell for a profit to rogue states like China and Iran.A United Nations report revealed by Reuters in early February estimated that North Korea made $300 million through cybercrime in 2020, much of it was used to fund its illegal nuclear weapons program.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityTechcommunismcyber attacksCybercrimeCybersecurityDepartment of JusticeKim Jong-unNorth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
495,"Wednesday saw the largest protests to date against the coup in Myanmar, despite a ban on large gatherings imposed by the military. Many of the demonstrators gathered outside the Chinese embassy in the city of Yangon and accused China of supporting the junta, or even using the junta as puppets so Beijing could take control of Myanmar.Thousands of people filled the streets of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, on Wednesday despite the junta’s ban on gatherings of more than four people. Protesters used their vehicles to block roads and bridges, popping their hoods to pretend they were having car trouble. This tactic made it difficult for police or military forces to disperse the demonstrators.Many of those demonstrators thronged outside the Chinese embassy, waving posters that showed Chinese dictator Xi Jinping working coup leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing like a marionette. According to the Financial Times, there are growing calls for direct action against Chinese interests in Myanmar, and mounting fears the junta will employ Chinese tactics against the restless Burmese population:Activists have in recent days launched an online campaign to boycott Chinese products. Some have even called for attacks on the natural gas pipeline linking China’s Yunnan province to Myanmar’s port of Kyaukphyu, a flagship infrastructure project.The junta have over the past three nights ordered telecoms operators to shut down internet service overnight, stoking speculation that it is installing a site-censoring “great firewall” with China’s help. “China! Don’t make firewall to block internet in Myanmar,” one of the signs held up by protesters at a recent embassy protest said. Protesters in Myanmar noted an unusual series of cargo flights from the Chinese city of Kunming to Yangon after the junta took control, and speculated the planes might contain Chinese surveillance and firewall equipment, or even Chinese troops. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Yangon claimed the flights were merely routine import and export deliveries, while the Chinese ambassador denounced rumors to the contrary as “completely nonsense.”The South China Morning Post (SCMP) on Tuesday quoted Ambassador Chen Hai insisting his country is maintaining lines of communication with both the Burmese military and the deposed civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League of Democracy (NLD):Ambassador Chen Hai told a group of local media outlets on Monday that Beijing had no “prior knowledge” of the coup and insisted rumours it was helping the military junta set up a firewall to prevent protesters from organizing online were “laughable”. The ambassador’s interview was posted on the embassy’s website on Tuesday.“We have friendly relations with both the NLD and the military. The current situation is absolutely not what China wants to see,” said Chen.This was the closest Beijing has come to criticizing the current unrest that has gripped one of China’s most important partners in Southeast Asia. No other country has more infrastructure investments in Myanmar than China, which regards its southeast Asian neighbor as a key part of its strategic goal of avoiding being encircled by US allies.The SCMP noted China and Russia used their positions in the U.N. Security Council to block a joint statement condemning the coup. Chen claimed this did not necessarily mean Beijing supports the junta, implying his government was more or less comfortable with the United Kingdom’s statement of concern about developments in Myanmar.Chen also claimed “people with ulterior motives” were spreading rumors about China surreptitiously sending equipment or soldiers to help the junta because they wish to damage “the good friendship between the people of our two countries.”China’s state-run Global Times quoted Chen insisting “the current development in Myanmar is absolutely not what China wants to see” and vaguely wishing all parties could “handle differences properly under the framework of the constitution and laws and maintain political and social stability.”Chen was as critical of the demonstrators outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon as he was of the military leaders who overthrew the civilian government.“Some people petitioned in front of embassies and international organizations in Myanmar. We understand their aspirations. And we also mentioned their reasonable demands when we strove to promote dialogue among different parties in Myanmar,” he said.“We hope all parties could stay calm and restrained, refraining from doing things that may intensify conflicts and escalate tensions. Under the current situation, violence should be avoided, and the basic rights of people need to be protected,” he added.“China and Myanmar are neighbors that cannot move away from each other. Friendly neighbors wish each other well. We hope that all things go well in Myanmar, rather than becoming unstable or even falling into chaos,” Chen concluded.“When it comes to China, we have been clear that we would like to see China play a constructive role in this. And that is a message that we have sent both publicly and privately to Beijing, and it’s a message that we’ll continue to send until China is clear in its condemnation of this coup,” the U.S. State Department countered Tuesday.As the Financial Times pointed out, China had a fairly solid relationship with the deposed civilian government, which agreed to participate in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, and it supported Suu Kyi’s government when it handled Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims in much the same way China treats its own Muslim population. Myanmar is a vital trading partner for China and trade was growing steadily before the coup. On the other hand, China also has a long history of supplying weapons to the Myanmar military, stretching back long before the elections that (temporarily) ended military rule. Members of the military elite grew very, very rich doing business with China, including a secret trade in Burmese jade that pillaged the country’s most valuable resource and made billions for Myanmar’s warlords and crime bosses. China has valuable oil and gas pipelines running through Myanmar and covets its access to the Bay of Bengal. The arrival of democracy in 2015 made the Chinese nervous. There is every reason to think they prefer dealing with a military dictatorship than an elected civilian government, although Beijing probably desires stability and protection for its investments in Myanmar above all else.AsiaNational SecurityChinacoupdemocracyMyanmar.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
496,"British politicians leading a growing call for a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing have drawn the ire of Chinese state media representatives warning of retaliation.Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-controlled Global Times, said Tuesday on Chinese platform Weibo any nation boycotting the 2022 Winter Games should be punished with sanctions.He specifically referred to Ed Davey, the leader of the UK Liberal Democrats, as a “mentally deranged” person.“As the hosting nation, to sanction a country ruining the Olympics, China would be doing justice on behalf of the heavens,” Hu said, according to a UPI report.His threat of retaliation continues a theme the editor first began earlier this month of attacking any person or government that dared to question the Beijing event:Boycotting 2022 Beijing Winter Games, an unpopular idea, won’t receive wide support. IOC and athletes will both oppose it, and China will seriously sanction any country that follows such a call. pic.twitter.com/3cOSb2wMdS— Hu Xijin 胡锡进 (@HuXijin_GT) February 7, 2021Hu spoke on the same day Hidetoshi Ishii, the vice president of the Free Indo-Pacific Alliance, told Breitbart News that allowing the event to proceed unchallenged will inspire a genocidal Communist regime to escalate its violence against ethnic minorities.China’s dispute with the UK began after the British government was called on to act after the BBC reported on systemic rape of ethnic Uighur women in Chinese concentration camps.“The evidence that a genocide is now occurring in western China is so clear that the United Kingdom and the whole world must now stand up to Beijing and use every available tool to stop it,” Davey had said in early February, according to the Guardian.Hu maintained politicians who call for a boycott are “evil forces” that must be punished.“The Chinese people will certainly stand firmly behind the Chinese government and its [potential] sanctions,” Hu said. “People of the world will surely support China.”Several U.S. Republican senators led a resolution to move the Beijing games earlier this month, following the United States’ designation that China’s actions in the region was “genocide” in the last days of the Donald Trump presidency.The Biden administration has so far said it had no intention of telling its athletes not to go.Beijing 2022, which will be the largest Winter Games yet with 109 medals on offer, is set to begin on February 4 next year.This will be China’s first time hosting the Winter Olympics, after holding the Summer Games in Beijing in 2008.

497,"Nepal banned three Indian climbers this year from mountaineering in the country for six years after they were found to have faked their summit of Mount Everest in 2016.Nepal’s Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) recently organized a special panel to investigate allegations by third parties that Indian nationals Narender Singh Yadav and Seema Rani Goswami did not summit Mt. Everest as they had previously claimed. The panel found that the duo fabricated their claims of ascending Mount Everest and banned all the climbers –along with their expedition leader and fellow Indian national, Nava Kumar Phukon – from conducting any form of mountaineering in Nepal for six years effective May 20, 2016, the date of their staged summit.“The investigation has confirmed that both of them [Yadav and Goswami] had obtained certificates by giving false details,” MoCTCA spokesman Taranath Adhikari told the Himalayan Times on February 11.Adhikari referred to the certificates MoCTCA awards to climbers as verification that they have ascended 29,032 feet to reach the peak of the world’s tallest mountain. To obtain a certificate, climbers must provide the ministry with photographic evidence of their summit; the photo must capture the climbers standing on the summit of Mount Everest and provide a clear view of their faces.Yadav and Goswami provided such photos to Nepal’s tourism ministry in 2016 and received individual certificates. MoCTCA revoked these documents in recent days after concluding its probe into the incident.“The [Nepali] government has also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 [$688] on the Seven Summit Treks Pvt Ltd, the agency which organized the expedition for the Indian nationals,” according to the Himalayan Times.“The ministry [MoCTCA] has also warned Pawan Kumar Ghimire, the liaison officer of the team, not to repeat such mistakes in the future,” the newspaper added, referring to the Nepali tourism ministry liaison who issued certificates to Yadav and Goswami validating their Everest summit.MoCTCA also fined the team’s climbing supporter, Nga Dawa Sherpa, 10,000 rupees (about $138) for filing “false documents claiming that Yadav had successfully climbed Mt Everest on 20 May 2016,” according to the report.“It’s a victory for the entire mountaineering fraternity and will demotivate others to do such blunder in future,” Phukon, who works with the Indian state of Assam’s sports ministry, told the Guardian on Thursday.“From day one I was telling everyone that Yadav’s summit claim was false and he morphed his picture. I was the leader of the expedition and he was part of the team. He never made the summit and even had frostbite. He along with Seema Rani Goswami had to be rescued by the Sherpas,” Phukon alleged.AsiaCrimeNational SecurityEverestIndiaMount EverestNepal.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
498,"Chinese media outlets praised President Joe Biden on Wednesday for what they characterized as a respectful, “positive” call between the head of state and Chinese dictator Xi Jinping.The Xinhua news agency and the Global Times state propaganda newspaper both highlighted the timing – on the eve of the Lunar New Year – as a gesture of goodwill from the new presidential administration. The former expressed hope that, after President Donald Trump’s tenure featured policies designed to contain the influence of the Chinese Communist Party abroad and frequent condemnations of its human rights atrocities, America under Biden would return to the “right track” of policy favorable to Beijing.Chinese media coverage of the phone call, the first between the two since Biden became president, contrasted considerably with American mainstream media claims that Biden had “pressured” Xi on issues such as the genocide of the Uyghur people in western Xinjiang or the repression of political dissidents in Hong Kong.“The Spring Festival is a very important holiday for the Chinese,” Xinhua’s coverage noted. “The telephone conversation between the two heads of state on the eve of the Lunar New Year marks a new starting point for direct communication, symbolizes goodwill, and conforms to the expectations of the Chinese and Americans, as well as those of the wider global community.”“Biden said Washington is prepared to have candid and constructive dialogue with China in the spirit of mutual respect and to improve mutual understanding and avoid miscommunication and miscalculation,” Xinhua detailed. “Those agreements bear positive significance for Beijing and Washington to dispel misunderstandings and engage in normal dialogue.”“With the inauguration of the Biden administration, returning the China-U.S. relationship to the right track has become a common aspiration of the international community,” the state news agency concluded.The Global Times in its coverage applauded Biden for a gesture that it noted “showed respect for President Xi and China.” The newspaper continued:The White House release also said at the beginning that Biden shared his greetings and well wishes with the Chinese people on the occasion of the Lunar New Year. This was widely interpreted as a gesture that Biden showed respect for President Xi and China. It seems that he was using such goodwill to balance the tough messages the new U.S. administration sent in recent days and various interpretations on those messages.An article citing its usual stable of Communist Party “experts” also emphasized Biden’s alleged “goodwill towards the Chinese government.” While noting that the White House claimed Biden discussed human rights issues with Xi, the Global Times‘ experts did not consider this a threat to the regime, or an indication that it should change its behavior in any way. Biden, they argued, had no choice but to follow “U.S. leaders’ old track of pressuring China, but unlike his predecessor, Biden is willing to bring those divergences under control through dialogue, instead of unilaterally slapping sanctions on China.”The newspaper also celebrated reports that Biden had undone recent policies implemented under Trump that limited the infiltration of the American academic system by the Communist Party’s “Confucius Institutes.” The Chinese Communist Party promotes Confucius Institutes within foreign universities, claiming they provide services to students like Mandarin language and Chinese cultural studies.In reality, Trump administration officials repeatedly highlighted them as foreign influence operations used to promote the Communist Party’s interests by imposing its agenda on universities. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused the institutes of recruiting spies for China and distorting the educational initiatives at the places that welcomed them. To that end, the State Department actively encouraged schools not to partner with them.This week, reports surfaced that Biden had withdrawn the Trump’s administrations proposed rule changes to prevent the expansion of Chinese influence through Confucius Institutes, something the Global Times praised.The newspaper’s editor, Hu Xijin, published his own remarks on the phone call, against applauding Biden for the “goodwill and respect” offered to Xi Jinping. Hu remarked:Biden and Xi are also very familiar with each other. It is no secret that there are some strategic divergences between China and the U.S.  Both countries need to face up to and manage these differences. The significance of the phone call today not only lies in that it has further promoted the personal communication between the two leaders, but also provided a sense of ritual to China-US relations and expresses mutual respect.Mainstream American outlets did not convey in their coverage of the call a sense that Biden had been overly effusive in sharing goodwill or “respect,” as their Chinese counterparts did. The New York Times painted the call as aggressive, leading with the claim that Biden raised “concerns about Beijing’s aggressive policies abroad and human rights abuses at home,” which Chinese outlets largely disregarded. The newspaper nonetheless noted that Biden has “said that he believed he had spent more time with Mr. Xi than he has with any other world leader.”CNN similarly claimed that Biden “call[ed] China out on a range of issues related to its nefarious use of technology, unfair trade and human rights abuses,” citing unidentified sources within the Biden administration.NBC News, citing the White House, also led its coverage with an emphasis on Biden mentioning the existence of human rights problems in China. AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinacommunismdiplomacyDonald TrumpJoe BidenLunar New YearmediaXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
499,"China’s Global Times government newspaper revealed on Monday that authorities have arrested 70 people involved in nearly two dozens cases of alleged sales of counterfeit Chinese coronavirus vaccines, including one suspect believed to have made nearly $3 million.China has developed a poor record in recent years of criminal distribution of faulty, counterfeit, or otherwise unusable vaccines, including many vaccines used in standard pediatrics. Most cases have involved companies or individual health workers watering down vaccine doses, leaving those receiving the doses immunocompromised. The most high-profile case of vaccine fraud surfaced in 2018 after police revealed evidence that a major pharmaceutical company, Changchun Changsheng Bio-technology, had administered nearly 1 million faulty vaccine doses, leaving nearly that number of children exposed to diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus, among other diseases.The revelation that nefarious groups have distributed fraudulent coronavirus vaccines delivers another blow to China’s reputation as a vaccine developer in light of internal resistance from Chinese nationals this year to taking their annual influenza vaccine; demand for the vaccine dropped dramatically in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.The Global Times reported on Monday, citing China’s largest Xinhua state news agency, that law enforcement officials would “crack down” on criminal attempts to profit from false coronavirus vaccines, though by the time that they made the announcement, criminals had reportedly profited to the tune of millions of dollars.“As of Wednesday, 70 criminal suspects had been arrested in 21 vaccine-related cases, said the procuratorate in a public announcement, requiring all relevant departments across the country to curb the crimes in a joint national campaign,” the Global Times said. “According to a case revealed in the announcement, a suspect, surnamed Kong, along with his associates sold about 58,000 counterfeit COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccines, making a profit of 18 million yuan ($2.78 million).”Kong’s operation, reportedly the most elaborate identified at press time, profited by injecting people with saline or mineral water, which does not cause any negative health effects but also has no impact on an individual’s ability to contract Chinese coronavirus. Kong and others reportedly held “mass vaccination” events where they sold their false vaccines, apparently without interruption from the Communist Party.The Global Times reported the arrests of those considered the major players in the scheme occurred in November and December. It did not explain why authorities waited two months to alert the public.Authorities hinted that some of the saline “doses” were smuggled abroad, but did not elaborate. It remains uncertain if the nations potentially affected are those who contracted with the Communist Party to purchase “Coronavac” and if their authorities are aware of the situation.Xinhua made a similar announcement in early February regarding the arrests of 80 people who also sold saline syringes as coronavirus vaccines. As the report on that occasion did not name any of those arrested, it is not clear if these individuals are part of the same schemes as those revealed on Monday. Most of the alleged 3,000 false vaccines distributed in the earlier scheme spread through the nation’s east coast, most prominently in Beijing; the report on Monday suggested that doses had reached as far as Hong Kong.The use of saline in syringes echoes the tactics involved in the Changsheng Biotech scandal in 2018. On that occasion, authorities revealed that the company had sold water-down vaccines as legitimate to parents. Changsheng also manufactured ineffective vaccines for diseases like rabies and sold them, anyway, as legitimate medical products. The company falsified manufacturing records to keep government drug regulating authorities unaware of the distribution of the faulty vaccines.Chinese authorities arrested 15 of the highest-ranked executives in the company and ordered a “thorough investigation” into the distribution of false or faulty vaccines, but by then outraged parents were too angry about their children being exposed to diseases needlessly. Protests erupted nationwide, including a particularly violent incident in January 2019 in which a group of outraged parents physically assaulted a Communist Party officials in the street in Jiangsu province. Police in video of the incident appeared to do little to deter the attack.Shortly after the details of the Changsheng scandal emerged, authorities revealed yet another incident of tampering with vaccines. Police reportedly identified a nurse in Shijazhuang, northern China, in February 2019 accused of systematically watering down vaccines at her local clinic to make each dose last longer, saving the clinic money.Amid the Chinese coronavirus pandemic last year, residents of northwest Lanzhou, China, were forced to confront a different kind of vaccine scandal: the local Lanzhou Biopharmaceutical Plant had used expired sanitizing products to keep their facility clean, resulting in a city-wide outbreak of the highly infectious bacterial disease brucellosis. Brucella, the bacteria responsible for the outbreak, can contaminate individuals through the air, also making the outbreak difficult to contain.The Lanzhou disease outbreak affected over 3,000 people.The South China Morning Post revealed in September that, after years of health hazards emerging as a result of criminal pharmaceutical company behavior, Chinese citizens were increasingly saying no to influenza vaccines, dramatically reducing demand for the shot.“[W]hile China has the capacity to increase flu vaccine supply, public demand has remained low because of a lack of trust, a lack of public awareness, poor access, as well as cost,” Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Post.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter. AsiaNational SecurityScienceChinaChinese Communist Partycoronavirus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

While some simply shared links to follow them on Koo, others asked their Twitter followers to join the app to get ‘exclusive’ updates about their ministries’ work,” Quartz news site reported Thursday.Several Indian government ministries and departments have created new accounts on Koo in recent days, including the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), the Central Board of Indirect Taxes, the National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology, India Post, MyGovIndia, and Digital India.I am now on Koo.

The ministry said the accounts were spreading misinformation and inciting violence amid New Delhi’s recent farmers’ protests. Twitter reversed its decision to comply with the order just 12 hours later, however, restoring access to the accounts. The Indian government issued Twitter a non-compliance notice in response.“After Twitter lifted the block, New Delhi issued a more serious warning to Twitter and its executives, citing the nation’s Section 69A, which allows ‘punishment with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fines,’” Tech Crunch reported.Twitter said it decided not to comply with all of MeitY’s blocking orders “because we do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law,” the San Francisco-based tech giant wrote in a blog post published February 10.“[I]n keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression, we have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians,” Twitter added.Tens of thousands of farmers, largely from the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab, have camped on the outskirts of India’s capital, New Delhi, since November to protest three recently passed agricultural reforms they say threaten traditional farm price protections. New Delhi has stood by the reforms, approved by the Indian Congress in September, arguing that they aim to help both farmers and consumers by modernizing India’s agricultural supply chain.The protests took a violent turn on January 26 after thousands of farmers defied government orders to march on pre-approved routes during an Indian national holiday. A mob of farmers broke through police barricades to storm central New Delhi on vehicles including tractors, motorbikes, horses, and cranes. Some farmers managed to overtake police stationed at Delhi’s historic Red Fort, breaking through the fortress’s gate and scaling its walls. One farmer died in the chaos after his tractor overturned.

501,"A Muslim teenager shot dead an Ahmadi homeopathic doctor at his clinic in Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar on Thursday, a local police official confirmed to Dawn.“A police spokesperson identified the slain man as Abdul Qadir who was shot dead by an accused identified as Ihsanullah, 18,” the Pakistani newspaper reported on February 12, adding that “locals overpowered Ihsanullah at the scene and handed him over to the police.”The victim, Abdul Qadir, 65, was an adherent of the Ahmadi faith, an official of Peshawar’s Inquilab police station told Dawn.Local police official Raiz Khan said on Thursday that authorities were still questioning the teenager who shot and killed the Qadir, adding that the motive behind the killing remains unknown.The Ahmadis are a minority religious community whose adherents reside largely throughout the Indian Subcontinent, where the faith was established in the 19th century. Ahmadis believe the religion’s founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, was the messiah promised by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Muslim faith.Pakistan’s parliament declared Ahmadis “non-Muslims” in 1974 and they are considered “imposter” Muslims by radical Islamists.In Pakistan, where Islam is the state religion and blasphemy laws are punishable by death, an Ahmadi “can get 10 years in prison for claiming to be a Muslim,” according to the Associated Press. Extreme discrimination is also present in other logistical arenas; for example, non-Ahmadis are forced to issue statements professing rejection of the faith to receive passports or other legal documents.A spokesman for the Peshawar’s local Ahmadi community, Saleem Uddin, released a statement condemning Thursday’s fatal shooting of Qadir, adding that members of his community “were being constantly targeted because of their faith.”Pakistan’s government threatened legal action against Google and Wikipedia in late December for featuring content about Ahmadis and cartoons of Muhammad in search results.The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) published letters on December 25 that it allegedly sent to Google and Wikipedia ordering them to remove content from their sites featuring information about the Ahmadi community and “deceitful” information about Islam.“PTA has been receiving complaints regarding misleading search results associated with ‘Present Khalifa of Islam’ and unauthentic version [sic] of Holy Quran uploaded by Ahmadiyya Community on Google Play Store,” the telecom authority’s letter to Google read.“Being a matter of very serious nature [sic], PTA has approached Google Inc. with the directions to immediately remove the unlawful content,” the ministry added.“Complaints were also received regarding hosting of caricatures of Holy Prophet (PBUH) and dissemination of misleading, wrong, deceptive, and deceitful information through articles published on Wikipedia portraying Mirza Masroor Ahmad as a Muslim,” the statement continued.“After extensive communication on the matter, Wikipedia has been finally served with the notice to remove the sacrilegious content to avoid any legal action,” the statement alleged.AsiaFaithNational SecurityAhmadiIslamMuslimPakistan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

That’s why everyone speaks.”He later retracted his words at a news conference, acknowledging it was inappropriate – but when pressed on whether he really thought women talked too much, he replied: “I don’t listen to women that much lately, so I don’t know.”A man holds placard with pictures of Yoshiro Mori, president of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic organizing committee on February 11, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan.

503,"The official Twitter account of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian followed an explicit homosexual porn account, Breitbart News can confirm.The Chinese Communist Party’s top “wolf warrior” spokesman’s account was found to be following an account entitled “qornograficx,” which displays graphic videos and pictures of men masturbating with sex toys and videos of men having sex with each other.Screencap of the qornograficx Twitter account, followed by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian, February 11, 2021. Kurt Zindulka, Breitbart NewsWhile China officially decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from its list of mental illnesses in 2001, it remains a taboo subject in the country.The dictatorship in Beijing, like most communist governments, has embarked on a campaign of repression against LGBT people in the country, beginning during the rule of Mao Zedong. The repression persists to this day, with widespread reports of forced “conversion therapy” including the use of electro-shock torture against gay people in the country.Homosexuality is heavily censored from the internet, television, and films by monitors in Beijing. Pornography, whether gay or straight, has also been banned by the Communist Party nationwide. Censorship extends to gay-related literature content, not simply images of film. Following the censorship of a genre of online gay fiction in 2017, the Chinese government protested that it did not properly “reflect core socialist values.”Access to Western social media websites such as Twitter is blocked under the communist nation’s strict censorship regime; however, many Chinese officials and state media propaganda outlets are active on Twitter.Zhao Lijian was one of the first Foreign Ministry officials to join the service, signing up for an account in 2010. The Foreign Ministry promoted Zhao to one of its top three posts as spokesman in 2019. At the time, he had already developed a reputation as one of the most belligerent voices in the agency.Screencap of the ‘qornograficx’ Twitter account, followed by Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian, February 11, 2021. Kurt Zindulka, Breitbart NewsOn the social media site, the Foreign Ministry spokesman regularly attacks the United States. He is the main voice promoting, without evidence, a conspiracy theory that U.S. Army caused the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Overwhelming scientific evidence indicates the pandemic began in Wuhan, China. A W.H.O. investigation into the origins of the virus, concluding this week, did not discredit the widely accepted reality that the virus originated there, nor did it produce any evidence signaling U.S. Army involvement in the pandemic.The so-called “wolf warrior” diplomat – a reference to the Chinese 2017 military propaganda film – also drew criticism in November after sharing a falsified image depicting an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child, accompanied with the caption: “Don’t be afraid. We are coming to bring you peace!”Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded an apology from Zhao and the Chinese state, saying: “It is utterly outrageous and it cannot be justified on any basis whatsoever.

504,"Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei would welcome a phone call from President Joe Biden and the chance to talk about the Chinese telecom giant’s future on U.S. soil.Zhengfei assured Biden if he made the call he would definitely pick up, in his first direct remark since the new administration took office.“I will welcome that, but there has been no call so far,” Ren said, adding he’d like to broach joint development between China and the U.S. if talks came about, according to the official Chinese Communist Party (CCP) news outlet Global Times.The remark was made last week at the sidelines of an event in Taiyuan, North China’s Shanxi Province, and follow a turbulent 12 months for the company and its dealings with the rest of the world.The Trump administration announced sanctions against the company last August that isolated it from some technology it sourced from the United States, as Breitbart News reported.Those impositions caused a shortage of computer chips for the company, hurting the growth of its smartphone business.“Huawei is an enormous threat to our national security,"" @newtgingrich told Breitbart News. “We have to find a strategy to defeat them.

505,"The U.S. military aid provided to the Philippines amounts to “loose change” compared to other Asian nations, a spokesman for Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said on Monday.“If we have very strong ties with a very strong ally, then I think it also comes with a higher amount of financial assistance to be given,” Philippine presidential spokesman Harry Roque told reporters on February 15.“We got $3.9 billion. Is that a huge amount? That’s loose change compared to what other countries were getting,” he said at a regularly scheduled press briefing.Roque referred to the findings of a study by the Washington D.C.-based Stimson Center, which showed that the U.S. donated $3.9 billion in counterterrorism support to the Philippines between 2002-2017. The U.S. donated $16.4 billion to Pakistan for the same purpose over the same time period.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on February 12 urged the U.S. to be more generous in its funding to the Philippines if it wants to protect the terms of its historic Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the country. The VFA, established in 1999, allows the U.S. to maintain a rotating troop presence on the Southeast Asian archipelago, whose location along the eastern rim of the disputed South China Sea is strategically important as a counter to China.“I’d like to put on notice if there is an American agent here, from now on, you want the Visiting Forces Agreement done? You have to pay,” Duterte said while addressing Philippine troops after inspecting newly acquired Philippine Air Force assets.“It is a shared responsibility, but your share of responsibility does not come free, after all, when the war breaks out we all pay,” Duterte said, alluding to a possible South China Sea conflict between the U.S. and China.Duterte canceled the VFA in February 2020 after Washington denied a political ally of his a U.S. visa. Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin, Jr., acting on Duterte’s order, suspended the revocation of the VFA for six months on June 1, citing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and “heightened superpower tensions.” Manila extended the suspension order by an additional six months in November. Philippine government officials say they have extended the suspension to allow more time for the two sides to agree to better terms.Roque said on Monday that Duterte was upholding the Philippines’ national interest and “not committing extortion,” as some critics have alleged, by extending the VFA suspension. Duterte has demanded fair compensation for the VFA, according to Roque, because a rotating U.S. troop presence in the Philippines puts the country at risk should a military conflict arise.“Are we correct in asking for payment so they can maintain their presence and equipment (here)?

506,"China’s Global Times government propaganda newspaper dismissed the BBC as a “rumor mill” that had threatened China’s “national security” in a justification of the Communist Party banning the global broadcaster.The Party removed BBC, which typically broadcasts left-of-center content, from Chinese airwaves – and in Hong Kong, where China has illegally usurped local authority – after the publication of a graphic report detailing extensive torture, including systematic rape, of individuals trapped in China’s western concentration camp system. Survivors told the BBC that guards would bring men into the camps every night to rape Uyghur and other Muslim ethnic minority women; many who experienced rape were also sexually assaulted with electric torture devices.Chinese officials have denied the report and claimed that all those testifying of abuses are hired actors and assorted criminals, without providing any evidence for these claims. China has openly admitted to building and maintaining concentration camps for Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities, but refers to them as “vocational training centers” and claims they are part of a larger social program to boost the economy in the nation’s west.The move to ban the BBC initially appeared to be a response to the United Kingdom revoking the broadcast license of China Global Television Network (CGTN), a Communist Party propaganda network. China’s broadcast regulatory authority had not mentioned the CGTN incident in its statement on BBC’s removal. Instead, officials said in a statement that the BBC “fails to meet the requirements to broadcast in China as an overseas channel.” The ban will remain in place for at least one year.Hong Kong authorities similarly announced that the BBC would be ineligible to broadcast in the former British colony. While the official statements from Chinese officials did not mention reporting on the Uyghur genocide, China’s National Radio and Television Administration independently condemned the reporting as having “infringed the principles of truthfulness and impartiality in journalism.”The Global Times made clear on Friday that BBC’s persistent coverage of human rights abuses in China was the primary reason for preventing people within Chinese borders from accessing it.“China has sent the outside world a clear signal that it has zero tolerance for fake news Friday by barring BBC World News from airing in China. The decision comes as no surprise,” the Global Times declared. “For quite a while, BBC has been no longer a news organization that upholds objective reporting, but has degraded into a rumor mill with no bottom line.”The BBC is now “paying the price for what it has done,” the outlet declared ominously.The Global Times went on to specifically condemn the BBC for its extensive report, including multiple on-the-record sources, detailing abuses in China’s concentration camps. Among its complaints about the report was the fact that some of the women speaking to the BBC had previously spoken to other media outlets about their experience. While American government sources estimate that, at their peak, China’s concentration camps in the Xinjiang region held as many as 3 million people, few have managed to escape. Most of those who have both escaped and been willing to testify in public – a small group of people – either have ties to foreign governments like Kazakhstan or are married to foreign nationals, giving them the connections to escape.“The same interviewees have appeared in almost every round of smear campaigns,” the Global Times protested on Friday, somehow proving that the BBC report was false.“BBC is carrying out a public opinion crusade against China,” the newspaper concluded, “threatening China’s national security with false reports.” It affirmed that banning Chinese people from access to the network “has nothing to do with freedom of the press.”The offending BBC report featured testimony from multiple named women who said they had endured torture in Xinjiang concentration camps and several anonymous reports, including testimony from a man who claimed to be a guard at one of the camps.Tursunay Ziawudun, one of the women who shared her story, described the nightly use of rape to torture women.“The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn’t know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock,” she told BBC. “They don’t only rape but also bite all over your body, you don’t know if they are human or animal … They didn’t spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at.”Another woman, an Uzbek woman identifying herself as Qelbinur Sedik, described rape as a “culture” in the camps.“It is gang rape and the Chinese police not only rape them but also electrocute them. They are subject to horrific torture,’” she said.The Chinese government responded to the report by denying the entirety of it and accusing everyone quoted in it of being a paid actor.AsiaLondon / EuropeNational SecurityBBCChinacommunismconcentration campsGlobal Timeshuman rightsUyghur.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
507,"Chinese broadcaster CCTV opened its annual four-hour-long Lunar New Year variety show Friday with a “multicultural” dance performance featuring ethnically Han Chinese performers in black skin paint pretending to be African. The use of blackface prompted global ire, as it was not the first instance of it appearing in the program.CCTV prompted a similar backlash in 2018 when airing a comedy sketch featuring a Chinese actress in blackface pretending to be an African woman who loved Chinese people. On that occasion, the actress accessorized her brown body paint with artificially enlarged buttocks and a plate of fruit on her head.The 2020 use of blackface occurred as part of a larger performance in honor of several countries participating in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global infrastructure plan that heavily indebts developing countries to the Communist Party. In addition to the dancers wearing blackface — which appeared to include children — Chinese dancers wore traditional outfits honoring Russia, Spain, Argentina, and Egypt. In the latter case, dancers wore what appeared to be an attempt at belly dancing outfits and dance uniforms inspired by ancient Egyptian pharaohs. The performance ended with traditional Chinese music and dance.The performance is part of a program known as the “Spring Festival Gala.” The incoming year on the Chinese calendar is known as the year of the ox. It was the opening showpiece performance of this year’s program. According to the South China Morning Post, the gala had received 1.8 billion views online by the end of Thursday local time.“Blackface” is the use of dark paint, and often falsified body parts like lips and noses, meant to make white-skinned people look African. It is inherently offensive to black people as its origins are in “comedy” programs, the main joke of which is ridiculing the appearance, voice, and culture of African and other black people.“The first minstrel shows were performed in 1830s New York by white performers with blackened faces (most used burnt cork or shoe polish) and tattered clothing who imitated and mimicked enslaved Africans on Southern plantations,” according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. “These performances characterized blacks as lazy, ignorant, superstitious, hypersexual, and prone to thievery and cowardice.”While the Communist Party heavily regulates Chinese social media, Reuters reported Friday that some criticism of the sketch made it onto Weibo, the nation’s most popular social media outlet. One user referred to those organizing the dance as “stupid and vicious;” another compared it to “white people slanting their eyes to make fun of Asians.”Black Livity China, an organization of African nationals living and working in China, issued a statement calling the dance “extremely disappointing.”Blackface once again at the Spring Festival Gala on CCTV – not the first time, and extremely disappointing to see. We cannot stress enough the impact scenes such as these have on African and Afro-diasporic communities living in Chinahttps://t.co/uNJPEtRAcZ— Black Livity China (@BlackLivityCN) February 11, 2021The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a defensive statement to Reuters, accusing those offended by the use of blackface of distance African nations from the Communist Party.“If anyone wants to seize on the CCTV Spring Festival Gala programme to make a fuss, or even sow discord in relations between China and African countries, they obviously have ulterior motives,” the statement read.The Chinese communist regime spent much of 2020 fielding accusations of outrageous racism against its large African community in southern Guangzhou city. At the height of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic there, officials claimed to residents that foreigners were responsible for the return of the virus after the government claimed to have contained it in its origin city, Wuhan. As African nationals are easiest to identify as foreign in China, Chinese businesses, landlords, and police officers targeted them for needless coronavirus testing. Hotels and apartment buildings expelled black people without reason, leaving dozens to sleep on the street despite having the money for shelter. Restaurants, including the American restaurant McDonald’s, placed notices on their doors stating they would not serve black people. Africans in Guangzhou protested that white Europeans did not receive similar treatment despite also being clearly “foreign.”The Chinese Communist Party dismissed the incidents as “misunderstandings.” The state-run propaganda newspaper Global Times warned the victims, “some Africans in Guangzhou need to readjust their way of thinking. … they need to respect and comply.”Chinese officials regularly use their international platforms, including at the United Nations, to accuse the United States of rampant racism against black people. This week, the Global Times claimed that America’s Chinese coronavirus vaccine drive, among the most successful in the world, was plagued with “structural racism.” Some of China’s attempts to portray America as a racist nation have included extremely offensive political cartoons against black people.Sup China, an online outlet that follows Chinese culture, noted that the 2020 CCTV Spring Festival Gala also “offered up its traditional sexist stereotypes about women and uncomfortable jokes about single people.” One of the sketches referred to a single woman as a “single dog;” in another, the outlet noted, “a divorced man jokes about his ex-wife looking like Voldemort when she does not have her makeup on.”AsiaNational SecuritySocial JusticeAfricaBelt and Road InitiativeblackfaceCCTVChinacommunismLunar New Yearracism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
508,"India’s foreign secretary will visit Moscow for two days starting Wednesday as part of New Delhi’s efforts to re-establish close relations with Russia, its traditional ally.“[Indian] Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will pay an official visit to Moscow on February 17-18 at the invitation of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.“The foreign secretary will hold the next round of India-Russia foreign office consultations with Deputy Foreign Minister Morgulov, during which the two sides will review the entire gamut of bilateral relations, including the forthcoming high-level exchanges,” India’s foreign ministry added.The visit takes place amid the United States’ recent objection to India’s planned purchase of five units of the S-400 air missile defense system from Moscow for an estimated $5.5 billion.The administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump had urged India to abandon the deal, asserting that New Delhi “did not have a wide waiver from a 2017 U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware,” Reuters reported on January 15.The U.S.’ opposition to the deal “is unlikely to change” under the new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, which has “promised an even tougher U.S. approach towards Russia,” anonymous sources told Reuters last month, though Biden has presented a far more conciliatory tone towards Moscow than Trump.New Dehli signed the S-400 deal with Moscow in October 2018. It made the first payment towards the purchase – about $800 million – in 2019 and is expected to receive all five of the systems by the end of this year.Indian authorities claim they need the long-range surface-to-air missiles to counter the military threat posed by China; the two Asian giants have been engaged in a border standoff along their unmarked Himalayan border since last summer.“India and the U.S. have a comprehensive global strategic partnership. India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia,” Indian foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said about the S-400 deal on January 8.“India has always pursued an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defense acquisitions and supplies which are guided by our national security interests,” Srivastava added.India’s military sent its first military team to Russia last month for training to operate the S-400 air defense system. Russia’s ambassador to India, Nikolay Kudashev, described the departure of the Indian military team to Russia as a “remarkable occasion” that would usher in “a new stage in our strategic partnership.”The Indian military team arrived in Russia sometime in late January and had begun training to operate the air defense system by February 3, the Russian military reported.AsiaNational Securityair defense missilesIndiaMoscowNew DelhiRussiaS-400.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
509,"Allowing the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics to occur unchallenged will inspire a genocidal regime to escalate its violence against ethnic minorities, Hidetoshi Ishii, the vice president of the Free Indo-Pacific Alliance, told Breitbart News this week.Ishii’s organization is among over 150 groups calling for a global boycott of the 2022 Winter Games in response to China’s construction and maintenance of over 1,000 concentration camps for Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities, its repression of Tibetans and Inner Mongolians, and the Communist Party’s litany of human rights atrocities. The initial call to boycott the games – an open letter to the global community and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) – occurred last week, a year to the day that the Games are scheduled to take place.“Anything less” than a global boycott, the groups warned in their open letter, “will be seen as an endorsement of the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian rule and blatant disregard for civil and human rights.”China has responded to the movement by calling the coalition “a band of disordered people” and threatening unspecified repercussions for any nation that chooses to boycott.At a press conference last week, Ishii emphasized the importance of the administration of President Joe Biden supporting the boycott. Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken has publicly called the atrocities against the Uyghur people in western Xinjiang, China, a “genocide,” agreeing with predecessor Mike Pompeo.In remarks to Breitbart News, Ishii asserted that, without American leadership, the greater cause of individual freedom is unlikely to succeed – in addition to the boycott itself.“Right now, the world is divided into the free world and the totalitarian world. America is the leader of the free world. It’s important for the world that America is a strong country holding the principle of freedom highly,” Ishii told Breitbart News. “If America shows weakness towards totalitarian and autocratic countries, then freedom will be lost from this world. We need [a] strong America that’s holding the principle of freedom highly.”Ishii also noted that boycotting the Beijing Olympics would not only make a statement in favor of racial and ethnic equality – given the extremely discriminatory policies of the host country – but one in favor of women’s rights, a topic that became a source of controversy for Olympics officials this month when the head of the committee organizing the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics complained that women cause meetings to be too long.Yoshiro Mori offered to resign as Olympics chief last week after calling women in meetings “annoying.” China has not offered to relinquish hosting duties after a BBC report found extensive evidence of systematic, daily use of gang rape and electricity in sexual torture against Uyghur women. Instead, Beijing claimed that all concentration camp survivors testifying to their experiences are hired actors, offering no evidence for this claim. China also banned the BBC from broadcasting in the country.“As BBC reported last week, it was exposed that Uyghur women are raped in concentration camps and also forcibly sterilized. There are Uyghur women that put themselves on media and testify,” Ishii told Breitbart News. “This problem is something we can never tolerate. However, in my country Japan for example, it doesn’t seem like feminists are raising voice on this issue. They were enthusiastically attacking the Tokyo Olympics Chief, Yoshiro Mori, for his so-called sexist comment enough to make him resign, though.”“If [the] Beijing Olympics succeeds with no problems, leaders in the Chinese government will have more confidence, thinking that what they’re doing is right,” Ishii warned.Ishii noted that the coalition seeking a boycott of the Games in Beijing has not yet, at press time, received any communications from the U.S. government, any American athletes, or the IOC.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters in early February that the Biden administration was not even considering boycotting the Games, despite Blinken affirming that the Biden administration considers China guilty of genocide.“We’re not currently talking about changing our posture or our plans as it relates to the Beijing Olympics,” she said, according to Reuters. “We consult, of course, closely with allies and partners at all levels to define our common concerns and establish a shared approach, but there is no discussion underway of a change in our plans from the United States at this point in time.”In contrast, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had hinted that the Trump administration would have considered a formal boycott of the event.Republican Congressman Mike Waltz (R-FL) introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives on Monday demanding the Biden administration boycott the Games. The draft, according to Fox News, states that American athletes “cannot in good conscience” participate in an event hosted by a genocidal government. It urged the Biden administration to, rather than deprive the athletes of a chance to compete, “propose the transfer of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games to a site other than within the People’s Republic of China.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecuritySportsBeijingBeijing Winter OlympicsboycottChinacommunismconcentration campsFree Indo-Pacific AllianceGenocideHidetoshi IshiiJoe BidenOlympicsUyghurUyghurs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
510,"A top North Korean official used his platform at an ongoing plenary meeting on Thursday to condemn senior communist officials “seized with extreme passivism and self-protectionism” for pursuing less aggressive economic goals than those dictator Kim Jong-un proposed.The official, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) Jo Yong-won, made his remarks a day after Kim Jong-un himself, presiding over the plenary meeting, urged Party leaders to “decisively enhance their responsibility” to pursue ambitious economic development, an indication that Kim remains unsatisfied with his underlings’ performances at their jobs.Kim has become increasingly critical in public of his own regime, a trend that escalated in 2020 as outside experts speculated that Pyongyang was struggling to contain the impact of both the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and the economic repercussions of its total border shutdown in response to it. North Korean officials claim that they have documented zero cases of Chinese coronavirus in the country, a statistic most public health experts question given the extreme measures that the country has taken in response to the pandemic. North Korea also faced historic flooding in 2020 that devastated acres of some of the nation’s most important crops, leading to food shortage concerns.In October, Kim Jong-un cried during a televised speech, telling citizens he was “sorry” for failing to meet their demands. Kim admitted defeat again in January, stating at the WPK Congress that his regime had failed in “almost all sectors” of economic development.As quoted in the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Jo Yong-won spent his time before the plenary meeting listing a litany of failures on the part of senior officials. Most involved situations where senior Party officials made bold announcements for major infrastructure projects and lower-level officials quietly recalibrated those promises to more modest goals. Construction officials, he noted in one example, “dared to bring down the goal of building 10,000 dwelling houses this year, which the Party Central Committee promised to citizens in Pyongyang.” Those in charge of electrical development “artificially lowered the plan of electric power production with indifference to the urgent demand from the economic construction and people’s living.” Party leaders in charge of the fishing industry, he added, had failed to plan “for supplying fishes to the people through positive fishing activities,” a complaint on which KCNA did not elaborate.Jo “sharply criticized senior officials of the Party Central Committee and the government who are responsible for shamefully setting the indices of major plans,” according to KCNA.The corner-cutting he condemned, KCNA paraphrased, “show they [WPK officials] are unhesitatingly abandoning even the decisions of the Party congress and pledge taken before the people, seized with extreme passivism and self-protectionism.” Their behavior, he concluded, “should be considered as absolutely intolerable anti-Party, anti-popular act against the idea and intention of Kim Jong-un, general secretary of the WPK.”A day before Jo’s reprimand, Kim delivered remarks at the plenary meeting, not condemning his officials but urging more enthusiasm and work ethic in solving the nation’s problems.Kim, in a report to the Party, “stressed over again the need for economic guidance officials to decisively enhance their responsibility and role in planning and guiding this year’s economic work,” according to KCNA. Kim called for “unusual awareness … to surely bring about a remarkable improvement in this year’s economic work and people’s standard of living.”The dictator reportedly opened the new plenary meeting on Tuesday to “stormy cheers of ‘hurrah!'” and called for, once again, more ambitious economic goals on the part of his officials. His initial report, according to KCNA, “sharply criticized the passive and self-protecting tendencies revealed by the state economic guidance organs in the course of setting this year’s goals, and stressed the principled matters for overcoming the tendencies and organizing the economic work in an innovative and meticulous way.”The plenary meeting, which North Korean state media organs said would continue but have not specified an end date for, also resulted in the creation of a special ad-hoc committee to discuss economic improvement. The South Korean news agency Yonhap observed on Wednesday that such a committee was an unusual step for Pyongyang to take, barely precedented in its modern history.Calling the committee “rare,” Yonhap suggested, “the North appears to have launched the rare committee in an apparent move to improve its outdated economic system as the country pushes ahead to achieve economic goals set forth at last month’s party congress.”Kim made the dire announcement in January that North Korea had failed to meet “almost all sectors” of its five-year plan. While noting that North Korea had endured a year of “unprecedented, worst-ever trials,” he nonetheless urged Party members to do more to achieve more economic success.His remarks in January were slightly less dramatic than those in October, where he addressed not Party leaders, but the general public.“Our people have placed trust, as high as sky and as deep as sea, on me, but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily,” Kim said on that occasion, amid visible tears. “I am really sorry for that. … my efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life.”North Korea’s usual sources of income — illegal trade with China along the northern Yalu River border — was largely unavailable to the country in the aftermath of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Instead, a U.N. report revealed this week showed that Pyongyang redirected its fundraising efforts towards cybercrime, building a network of hackers to steal money from online accounts. North Korea made about $300 million in 2020 through cybercrime, according to the report, which Reuters published on Monday.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismEconomicsKim Jong-unNorth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
511,"China’s state-run Global Times on Tuesday reported the country registered 10 million newborns in 2020, a 15-percent decline from 2019 that brought China’s birth rate well below the “warning level” demographics experts have established.
According to the Global Times, there was some dispute between the Ministry of Public Security and the National Bureau of Statistics about precisely how many children were born in China last year, but no matter which agency gets the last word, the demographic news is not good:There has been a declining curve of yearly new births in China — 17.86 million, 17.23 million, 15.23 million and 14.65 million in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively, according to data released by the NBS.“The low birth rate in China has reached an alarming degree, but it is not a surprise,” Mu Guangzong, a professor from the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The main reason for the decline is the low desire among young couples to have children due to the high cost of supporting a child, he said, noting that for many young couples, the general housing and education policies in China as well as the social environment as a whole do not encourage them to have kids.The Global Times obliquely referred to the “unbalanced sex ratio of Chinese people” as another factor in declining birth rates. In other words, back when the authoritarian Chinese government was strictly enforcing its “one-child policy” with mandatory contraception and abortion, girls were considered a disposable luxury by parents desperate to have a son. A generation later, China finds itself with a shortage of mothers, and male children still account for 52.7 percent of births. As of 2019, the Chinese population included 30.49 million more males than females.“Nothing like this has happened in human history,” the Washington Post said of China’s sex imbalance in 2018, noting that Beijing must manage a generation of men “who will never find wives and only rarely have sex” that is roughly comparable to the population of California.“Beyond an epidemic of loneliness, the imbalance distorts labor markets, drives up savings rates in China and drives down consumption, artificially inflates certain property values, and parallels increases in violent crime, trafficking or prostitution in a growing number of locations,” the Washington Post warned, noting that India has an equally troubling sex imbalance and many other Asian nations are not far behind.The Global Times quoted Minister of Civil Affairs Li Jiheng’s warning in December that China has reached a “critical turning point” and sorely needs a “national strategy to tackle the aging population.” Li said the fertility rate has plunged “dangerously” beneath the rate of 2.1 births per woman required to maintain a stable population, urging government action to boost the fertility rate to meet China’s growing need for workers. Other Chinese analysts estimated it could take 15 years or more for relaxed family planning rules to noticeably increase the birth rate, while China’s population of retirees swells inexorably to 300 million over the next few years.AFP postulated Tuesday that China’s reversal of its notorious “one-child policy” in 2016 has yet to produce a “baby boom” due to “empowered Chinese women often delaying or avoiding childbirth and young couples blaming rising costs and insufficient policy support for families.”The BBC noted China’s birth rate hit a 70-year low in 2019, three years after the end of the one-child policy. This is commonly attributed to a lack of government financial support for young couples to have the families their government suddenly desires, after years of threatening to destroy their lives if they dared to have a second child, but as the Global Times story suggested, there is growing concern that the male-female imbalance may have created a demographic log jam that cannot be cleared with government subsidies.AFP’s report suggests China faces a unique combination of its own self-imposed demographic issues and the problem faced by almost every industrialized society: convincing young people to have children, especially multiple children, instead of pursuing their careers and enjoying material success is very difficult.Not even two children are sufficient to rise above the 2.1 births per woman threshold of stable population growth; many families with three or more children are needed, and this is difficult to achieve if young people delay marriage and family in favor of professional and financial success. Reversing a plunge as steep as China’s, with such a huge excess of males in the population, probably cannot be achieved by simply offering larger subsidies to defray the cost of raising children.AsiaNational SecurityChinaDemographicsOne Child Policy.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
512,"The Indian army claimed Tuesday that it is using specially trained dogs to detect positive cases of the Chinese coronavirus among soldiers, alleging the method is faster than widely-used rapid tests for the virus.The dogs have sniffed out 22 positive coronavirus cases from 800 samples at an army transit camp in New Delhi so far, Indian Army Lt. Col. Surinder Saini told Press Trust of India (PTI) on February 9.“Their response time after detection is one second or even less, and accuracy rate is over 90 percent,” Saini, who serves as an instructor at the Indian Army’s dog training facility in Meerut, said.“The use of such canines in detection of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] can assist in quick and real-time detection of the disease, and help in cutting down [the] scale of RT-PCR [reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction] and rapid antigen tests, both of which take time,” Saini said.The military has so far trained two dogs — a two-year-old cocker spaniel and a one-year-old chippiparai, a breed of sighthound indigenous to India’s Tamil Nadu state — to detect the Chinese coronavirus by sniffing samples of sweat and urine, senior Indian Army officials told PTI.“Besides these two dogs, eight other dogs, including four labradors, are also undergoing training,” Saini revealed.“Army dogs were successfully trained on specific biomarkers emanating from urine and sweat samples of positive patients. These samples do not contain living virus, but only volatile metabolic biomarkers, which the dogs have been trained to detect,” the lieutenant colonel said.“This is the first time in India that the olfactory capability of canines are being used to detect tissues infected with pathogens releasing volatile metabolic biomarkers,” he added.Early results from several studies around the world indicate high levels of accuracy by sniffer dogs in detecting traces of the Chinese coronavirus in a person’s system. Scientific researchers caution that peer-review processes and larger-scale studies are still needed to validate the initial findings. Several countries including the U.S., England, Germany, Finland, Russia, Australia, Chile, Lebanon, and Iran have trained sniffer dogs over the past year to detect cases of coronavirus in humans.The military plans to deploy the trained dogs to a transit camp in northern India, from which troops are sent to high-security border areas, including along India’s Himalayan boundary with China in northern Ladakh state. The two nations are currently engaged in an ongoing border standoff that sparked in Lakdakh’s Galwan Valley last summer.The Indian Army’s inclusion of the chippiparai sighthound in its virus detection program was part of a concerted effort to train a breed of dog indigenous to India to detect the Chinese coronavirus, a senior Indian army official told PTI on Tuesday. The decision was made as part of the military’s effort to incorporate Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” or “Self-Reliant India,” initiative into the program, the official explained.Modi launched the “Self-Reliant India” initiative in April 2020 in direct response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which exposed India’s overdependence on its neighbor, China, for trade and manufacturing, according to the prime minister. The campaign encourages Indian businesses to support and develop existing domestic supply chains and foster new ones moving forward.AsiaHealthNational SecuritycanineCaninesChinaChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthIndiaIndian Armytesting.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
513,"Months of drought in southern and eastern China have left more than 300,000 people with drinking water shortages, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Sunday.Recorded rainfall since October in regions south of China’s Yangtze River has been 50 to 80 percent lower than usual, the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources said on February 4. Roughly 2.4 million people across the southeastern coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong have already been affected by the drought, and concerns are “growing” for people residing in Guangxi, Hunan, and Yunnan provinces, the ministry said.“More than 500,000 hectares of arable land” in China have been affected by the drought so far, “leaving 330,000 people in rural areas without a sufficient supply of potable water,” the ministry revealed.Authorities in the Zhejiang county of Sanmen recently ordered that the water supply to residents’ homes be shut off on alternate days, according to the state-run China Central Television (CCTV). Businesses deemed non-essential by the county government and that use large amounts of water have been asked to suspend operations temporarily.China’s Ministry of Water Resources said last week that it sent government officials to the affected regions to monitor the situation. The ministry added that it has consulted with China’s finance ministry to allocate disaster relief funds to “severe drought areas” and ensure residents’ water supply.About three-quarters of Zhejiang — a province the size of South Korea — has been impacted by the drought so far, according to Lei Yuan, a senior engineer at the Zhejiang Meteorological Service Center.“While fall and winter always see less rain than the rest of the year, it’s usually not dry enough to declare a drought. But the average rainfall since October has been 70 percent lower compared with the same period last year,” Lei told the Chinese news site Sixth Tone on February 8.Several Zhejiang cities have issued wildfire warnings in recent weeks. The Zhejiang government recently predicted that the province’s drought will last until at least April.The lack of rain has already devastated Chinese autumn and winter crops, including potatoes, peppers, tomatoes, and bananas, and may threaten this year’s rice harvest.“If the precipitation continues to be low, it may affect rice seeding and planting,” Qian Yonglan, a senior researcher at China’s National Meteorological Center, told the SCMP on February 7.“However, as early rice has not yet been planted on a large scale, the impact so far has been limited,” she added.AsiaEnvironmentNational SecurityChinadrinking waterDroughtEnvironmentrainfall.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
514,"India’s military has ordered an “emergency procurement” of weapons and special equipment to its western Himalayan border with China, India’s government said on Monday.“On the basis of the threat perception and technology available, the armed forces are procuring terrain and weather-specific equipment to thwart the likely threat from our Northern adversary,” India’s Minister of State for Defense Shripad Naik said in a statement to Press Trust of India (PTI) on February 8, referring to China.“In the current standoff, emergency procurement for certain arms and equipment have been undertaken by the armed forces to beef up their combat potential,” he added.The supplies have been ordered to the northern Indian state of Ladakh, according to PTI. India is currently engaged in a months-long border standoff with China that began in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley last summer. A hand-to-hand clash between Indian and Chinese border regiments on June 15 killed 20 Indian troops and an estimated 40 Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers. It marked the deadliest military conflict between India and China along their Himalayan border in 45 years and launched an ongoing standoff between the two sides.“Close to 100,000 Indian and Chinese troops are currently deployed in eastern Ladakh as both sides have been holding on to their ground and showing readiness for a long-haul, amid continuing diplomatic and military talks to find an amicable solution,” PTI noted on Monday.Indian defense minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Monday that India was also in the process of bolstering its air defenses, which are crucial to the country’s border protection in the high-altitude Himalayas. Singh said that the Indian Air Force will procure six additional Rafale fighter jets from France by next month as part of an ongoing weapons trade.“I want to inform that till [now] 11 Rafale have arrived and by this March 17 Rafale will be on our land. I also inform that all Rafale will … reach India by April 2022,” Singh said.New Delhi signed an inter-governmental deal with Paris in 2016 to secure 36 Dassault Rafale French twin-engine aircraft for $8.85 billion.China’s foreign ministry on Monday accused India of being responsible for the “root cause” of their ongoing border dispute.“For a long time, the Indian side has conducted frequent acts of trespass in the border area in an attempt to encroach on China’s territory and constantly created disputes and frictions, which is the root cause of the tensions at the China-India border,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Weng Wenbin said at a daily press briefing.“We urge the Indian side to follow through on the consensus, agreements, and treaties it reached with China, and uphold peace and stability in the border region with concrete actions,” he added.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaHimalayasIndia.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
515,"China’s state-run Global Times propaganda newspaper threatened other states considering a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics with “fierce” retaliation on the part of the Communist Party in a column published Sunday.Over 150 human rights groups around the world launched a campaign last week urging countries to boycott the Olympics in recognition of the horrific human rights atrocities the Chinese Communist Party is committing against its citizens, particularly members of ethnic minorities subject to rape, slavery, and extreme torture in concentration camps. The groups also noted the repression of Tibetan and Mongolian ethnic minorities outside of Xinjiang, where most of the nation’s concentration camps are located, and the increasingly violent state repression against pro-democracy dissidents in Hong Kong.No foreign government has yet to declare they will boycott the 2022 games. Legislators in the United States and the United Kingdom have launched campaigns to pressure their governments to make a statement in favor of human rights, however, by withdrawing from the event.Should the 2022 Olympic Games go forward, Beijing would become the first city in history to host both Summer and Winter games; Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics.In response to news that some countries were considering responding to the call to boycott the Games, the Global Times, in an editorial, asserted, “China is a sporting and economic power with growing political influence.”“If any country is encouraged by extremist forces to take concrete actions to boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics, China will definitely retaliate fiercely. China certainly has the resources and means to do that,” the editorial warned.The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Hu Xijin, independently issued his own, milder threat against any state considering a boycott.“China will seriously sanction any country that follows such a call,” Hu claimed.China has previously attempted to silence opponents with sanctions, most recently issuing personal sanctions against members of the former Trump administration, most prominently former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, after Pompeo issued a formal declaration that China’s concentration camps and systematic sterilizing of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang constituted a genocide. The sanctions ban those affected from traveling to China or doing business with the Communist Party, activities they were unlikely to take part in, anyway.The column went on to argue that supporting China’s hosting bid was part of the “defensive war” against the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, central China, in 2019. The 2020 Summer Games, scheduled to take place in Tokyo, Japan, have already been postponed and are expected to take place in July.“If the Tokyo Games were finally forced to be canceled, the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games will become a defensive war of the Olympics against the pandemic,” the Global Times claimed, describing boycott calls as “an evil trend” that the world should “despise.”While feeling the need to issue unspecified threats against foreign powers on behalf of its government, the Global Times claimed that the boycott movement had no real chance of success, which raised the question of why the threats are necessary.“We are convinced, however, that such extreme claims, which are grossly contrary to the Olympic spirit, will never be widely echoed,” the editorial board claimed. “A few activist groups and Western politicians have always tried to make a fuss about their presence ahead of the Beijing Winter Olympics. None of the IOC [International Olympic Commission], national athletes, or people at large will be willing to be held hostage by this small group of forces. Their plot will never succeed.”The editorial board went on to dismiss human rights activists as “just a band of disordered people” and alleged that prior Olympics boycotts — specifically the 1980 boycott of the Soviet Union as a host — were unmitigated failures.Over 150 human rights groups around the world — largely consisting of Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Hong Kong advocacy groups — urged the world to boycott the Games last week. In an open letter to world leaders, the groups noted extensive evidence that Beijing is committing genocide against the Uyghur people, targeting ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz people in the process who live in the same region of the country. In occupied Tibet, Chinese officials have banned the indigenous Tibetan language and attempted to replace it with Mandarin, the Chinese dialect common to Han Chinese people in the northeast. Inner Mongolians have protested similar measures to eradicate their native language and culture.A BBC report published last week, citing multiple on-the-record eyewitnesses who escaped China’s concentration camps, revealed the government there promotes the systematic, nightly rape of those imprisoned in the camps. Chinese government officials torture women by using electric batons to rape them.Human rights groups warned state actors that a boycott was a clear way to “ensure they are not used to embolden the Chinese government’s appalling rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent.”“The IOC [International Olympic Committee] refused to listen in 2008, defending its decision with claims that they would prove to be a catalyst for improved human rights,” the groups’ statement read. “As human rights experts predicted, this decision proved to be hugely misplaced; not only did China’s human rights record not improve, but violations increased substantially without rebuke.”The IOC has yet to issue any definitive statements on the human rights scandal. On the contrary, IOC President Thomas Bach issued a statement last week, eagerly promoted by the Communist Party’s People’s Daily, assuring the world that his organization had the utmost trust in the Party’s ability to host the Games.“Having seen how China is overcoming the coronavirus crisis, we are very confident that our Chinese hosts will ensure safe and secure Olympic Games in full cooperation with the IOC,” Bach asserted. “This is why, we can say already now with great confidence: China is ready. Ready to welcome the world’s best winter sports athletes for unforgettable Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. We all are looking forward to this global celebration of sport.”The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has indicated it will not boycott the Beijing Olympics.“We’re not currently talking about changing our posture or our plans as it relates to the Beijing Olympics,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecuritySports2022 Winter olympicsBeijing Winter OlympicsChinacommunismhuman rightsInner mongoliaJoe BidenOlympicsTibetUyghurUyghurs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
516,"China’s People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party, accused America’s coronavirus vaccination program of suffering from “long-term structural racism” in a column Monday, citing American public health personality Dr. Anthony Fauci.The Chinese Communist Party has for years accused the United States of alleged human rights abuses against minorities in the country and has increasingly referred to “systemic” or “structural” racism as a human rights crisis in the country. Beijing’s alarm over the alleged situation contrasts with the Communist Party’s treatment of its own ethnic minorities, most prominently the genocide of the Uyghur people of Xinjiang, perpetuated in an elaborate concentration camp system.African and other black-skinned people also face significant racism in China. In Guangzhou, a southern city known for its large African diaspora population, Han Chinese business owners, landlords, and other community members began refusing their services to black people following the eruption of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, as the government had warned residents that foreigners were spreading the virus and Africans were the easiest foreigners to identify. The discrimination forced dozens of African city residents to sleep outside because no hotel or apartment building would take them, despite the fact that they could afford to pay for a room.The People’s Daily condemned alleged top-down racism in America and accused it of hampering national efforts to vaccinate the population against the Chinese coronavirus. It noted statistics that black and Hispanic Americans are less likely to have received a Chinese coronavirus inoculation than white American counterparts.“The problems exposed by the medical industry reflect the current reality most viscerally. Long-term structural racism has prevented American minorities from accessing quality medical services, and the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic has further exacerbated this problem,” the newspaper claimed. “Minorities’ right to health, which is already poorly guaranteed, has been challenged in the extreme, causing significant tragedy and loss.”The outlet cited Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for support in its theory.“One of the extraordinary aspects of this pandemic is the racial and ethnic disparities,” Fauci allegedly said.The People’s Daily called racism a “‘mental plague’ hanging over American society” and implied that America itself was irreparably broken, and its racism was merely a symptom of that.“Only rotten trees grow bad apples. Racism has been entrenched throughout the history of the U.S. In American history, black people were enslaved and forced to work under cruel conditions,” the newspaper observed.China’s state-run propaganda outlets have repeatedly condemned the United States for its efforts to develop and distribute a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, central China in late 2019. An American company, Pfizer, was the first to receive widespread approval for a coronavirus vaccine – Russia approved its Sputnik V vaccine candidate prior to the Pfizer approval, but amid much international skepticism – and China’s government trusts the American product enough to purchase at least 100 million doses of the vaccine.The Pfizer vaccine, developed with the European company BioNTech, is believed to be about 95 percent effective in fighting the Chinese coronavirus. In contrast, China’s top vaccine candidate, “Coronavac” by the firm Sinovac, is about 50 percent effective. Chinese propaganda outlets declared Coronavac’s success rate “good enough,” then attacked Pfizer, claiming its vaccine was unsafe. Coverage of China’s purchase of Pfizer vaccine doses in Chinese outlets has been careful to refer to it as the “BioNTech” vaccine.The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly condemned the United States for alleged racial disparities in society outside of the context of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. In September, addressing protests about racial discrimination by the police in the United States, China’s Xinhua news agency attempted to make a pointed commentary through a political cartoon with an offensive racist message, depicting a black man running from police as officers shouted “hunt that blackie!” In November, the Chinese delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Council demanded that American officials “root out systematic racism, address widespread police brutality and combat discrimination against African- and Asian-Americans.”China has rarely refused to address its own racist policies and has openly denied practices in its western Xinjiang region that Western government officials and human rights advocates have called a genocide against Uyghur people and other majority-Muslim ethnic minorities.Studies have revealed that China has imprisoned as many as 3 million people in its Xinjiang concentration camp system since at least 2018. Survivors of the camps say that they were subject to communist indoctrination, forced to learn Mandarin, the language of the Han people of northeast China, and forced into slavery. They have also testified to extreme incidents of torture, including the systematic, nightly rape of women and the use of electric batons to rape and torture victims. Uyghur women have also testified to being forced to endure abortions, having their infant children killed in the camps, and being sterilized against their will.Chinese officials claim the concentration camps are “vocational training centers” to help ethnic minorities learn job skills. It has denied it is practicing genocide. China has celebrated the forced sterilizations as a form of feminist liberation for Uyghur women and declared all witnesses to the atrocities “actors.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaHealthNational SecurityAnthony FauciChinacommunismconcentration campscoronavirusPfizerracismUyghurUyghurs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
517,"China’s Ambassador to America Cui Tiankai repeated an increasingly vocal demand out of Beijing on Sunday for the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to treat the United States as a potential origin location for the Chinese coronavirus, despite no scientific evidence suggesting this is possible.The Chinese coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The first confirmed case of Chinese coronavirus, according to leaked Chinese documents revealed by the South China Morning Post, was identified on November 17, 2019. No evidence exists anywhere in the world for a confirmed novel coronavirus case emerging anywhere else in the world before this date.The Chinese Communist Party has not confirmed – or denied – the legitimacy of the South China Morning Post leak and does not consider that date a viable origin point in investigating where the virus first began infecting human beings. Chinese government officials have pointed to reports suggesting that early cases of the virus occurred in places like Italy and Brazil, but those reports do not specify a date before November 17.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokespersons have also claimed, in their official capacity, that the Chinese coronavirus originated at a U.S. Army facility in Maryland, and that Washington covered up the initial outbreak by diagnosing cases as incidents of e-cigarette lung injury. Beijing has never provided any evidence for this claim or explained how a highly contagious coronavirus infection could pass for a lung injury, which is not contagious and does not require patient isolation.A team of microbiologist investigators from the W.H.O. is currently in Wuhan, where the virus originated, seeking clues as to where the virus first began infecting humans. As the Chinese government has admitted to destroying all early evidence of the virus in the city, investigators have yet to reveal they have found any substantive information, but have insisted their year-late visit to Wuhan was “still worth” making the time.Ambassador Cui, speaking to CNN on Sunday, pressured the W.H.O. to send similar delegations to the United States.“[T]here have been a number of media reports about early cases in other places in the world. So there’s a certainly [sic] need for more tracing to be done all over the world in order to really trace down the origin of the virus,” Cui told the network. “So the human race could be better prepared when we are faced with another virus again. So please do not politicize the whole issue. Please let the scientists do their professional job.”Asked if China would allow the W.H.O. team full access to relevant sites in Wuhan, Cui replied, “They are already in Wuhan. They have been in Wuhan for quite a few days. My questions [sic] is, will they be allowed to come here [America] to do the same thing?”Cui did not offer any evidence for suggesting that the W.H.O. team visit the United States or mention the existence of any facts that would lead scientists to believe that the virus originated in America.In the same interview, Cui insisted, “I think when people make accusations, they have to prove these accusations.”Faced with another topic – the overwhelming evidence of extensive, systematic human rights atrocities committed by his government against ethnic minority people in western Xinjiang, China – Cui claimed that all evidence was “misinformation” and that China’s sprawling concentration camps for Muslim minorities were “vocational training centers,” the official explanation of the Communist Party.Cui’s message urging scientists to treat the United States as a potential coronavirus origin location has become routine from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which holds daily briefings for friendly journalists. The state-run propaganda outlet Global Times noted that spokesman Wang Wenbin’s demand for a W.H.O. investigation into America that day was the third such message that week.“We hope that relevant parties, like what China has done, adopt a positive attitude in tracing the origins and invite W.H.O. experts to conduct origin studies, contributing to their efforts on the global fight against the pandemic,” Wang asserted, referring to the United States.“The W.H.O. mission’s visit to China this time is part of global science cooperation on origin-tracing. It is a first stop rather than the end,” Wang insisted.
Wang once again pressured the W.H.O. to send an investigative team to other countries on Monday.“More and more facts have shown that the virus and epidemics had been present in multiple places as early as in the second half of 2019,” Wang said. “A comprehensive analysis of relevant information and systematic visits to relevant sites will help draw a scientific, objective and comprehensive conclusion on the source of the virus.”Wang ominously added that Chinese “experts” had come to some form of “consensus” with the W.H.O. team, without elaborating.The Global Times supported the message from Beijing last week with an article citing pro-communist “experts” who also insisted that the virus likely did not originate in China, despite all available evidence suggesting so.“The U.S. has the most diverse virus strains, which make it the most suitable place for conducting study of origins,” one “expert” said. Another warned the W.H.O., “Wuhan is just a stop for virus origin tracing, and those experts should not expect to find an answer here.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityScienceChinacommunismcoronavirusWorld Health OrganizationXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
518,"A Maori politician who claims a necktie symbolises “a colonial noose” was ejected from New Zealand’s Parliament when he defied custom and entered without one.Speaker Trevor Mallard twice prevented Rawiri Waititi from asking questions in the debating chamber on Tuesday, insisting lawmakers could only ask a question if they were wearing a tie.Waititi, 40, who became an MP for the first time in the election last October, was wearing a taonga, a Maori greenstone pendant instead, Reuters reports.When Waititi continued with his question after being stopped a second time, Mallard ordered him to leave on the basis the current dress code specifies “business attire.”“It’s not about ties, it’s about cultural identity, mate,” Waititi said as he exited the chamber, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.Waititi said his action was directed at the right of Māori to be Māori, whether in Parliament or in the pub, a matter of debate he has since sparked by his actions.﻿“I took off the colonial tie as a sign that it continued to colonise, to choke and to suppress out Māori rights that Mallard suggests gives us all equality,” Waititi said later outside the chamber.“This is about more than just the tie or the taonga, this has everything to do with equality.”This was not the first time Waititi had challenged the New Zealand parliament’s dress code. In December, during his maiden speech, he removed his tie and was given a warning.Asked to comment, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was not something she had a strong opinion on, and that she had no objection to someone wearing a tie in Parliament or not.“There are much more important issues for all of us,” Ardern said.In Britain, the requirement for male MPs to wear ties was dropped in 2017.The then-Speaker John Bercow made the impromptu ruling in the middle of a debate when one MP objected to another asking a question while not wearing a tie.AsiaLondon / EuropePoliticsJacinda Ardernjohn bercowMaoriNew Zealand.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
519,"Twitter said on Wednesday it would not fully comply with an Indian government order to suspend hundreds of accounts accused by New Delhi of spreading misinformation and inciting violence in the nation’s ongoing farmers’ protests. It made the statement after blocking over 500 accounts last week.“We have withheld a portion of the accounts identified in the blocking orders … within India only. These accounts continue to be available outside of India,” Twitter wrote in a blog post on February 10. “Because we do not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law, and, in keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression, we have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians.”“To do so, we believe, would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law,” the social media platform added.Twitter temporarily blocked more than 500 accounts last week, including some belonging to news websites and protest activists at the request of India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). The company reversed its decision within hours in the face of online outrage, however, restoring access to the suspended accounts. The action prompted the Indian government to serve Twitter with a non-compliance notice.“After Twitter lifted the block, New Delhi issued a more serious warning to Twitter and its executives, citing the nation’s Section 69A, which allows ‘punishment with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fines,'” Tech Crunch recalled on February 10.New Delhi responded to Twitter’s blog post later Wednesday, tweeting that the company had earlier reached out to MeitY for a meeting.“In this light a blog post published prior to this engagement is unusual,” the tech ministry said, adding that the Indian government would formally respond to Twitter’s blog post soon.Upon the request of Twitter seeking a meeting with the Govt., the Secretary IT was to engage with senior management of Twitter. In this light a blog post published prior to this engagement is unusual. Govt. will share its response soon.— Ministry of Electronics & IT (@GoI_MeitY) February 10, 2021Tens of thousands of farmers have occupied the area encircling India’s national capital, New Delhi, since November to protest three agricultural reforms passed by the Indian Congress in September that they claim have threatened their traditional farm price and labor protections. New Delhi maintains that the reforms are designed to help both farmers and consumers by streamlining India’s agricultural supply chain. The majority of the farmers have traveled to the capital area from the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab and neighboring Haryana state.The protests turned violent on January 26 after the farmers defied government orders to march on pre-approved routes. Thousands of farmers broke through police-laid barriers to enter central New Delhi on “tractors, motorbikes, horses, and even cranes.” A mob of farmers overtook police stationed at Delhi’s Red Fort, storming the historic site. One farmer died in the melee after his tractor overturned, and more than 300 hundred police officers were injured.The Indian government had issued several blocking orders to Twitter over the past ten days in which it identified “a number of accounts it said used provocative hashtags to spread misinformation about the protests as well as [to] incite violence. The government invoked an information technology law under which it has the power to direct online intermediaries and internet service providers to block certain content,” according to the Associated Press on Wednesday.New Delhi expressed specific concern in one of its orders that many Twitter users were sharing false and intimidating statements, including the use of the Twitter hashtag #modiplanningfarmersgenocide.“Incitement to genocide is a grave threat to public order and therefore the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY) ordered for blocking of these Twitter accounts and Tweets under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act,” an Indian government source allegedly told Agence France-Presse (AFP) journalist Bhuvan Bagga last week.AsiaNational SecurityTechBig TechFarmersIndiaproteststechTech CensorshipTwitter.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
520,"Chinese officials at a press conference on Wednesday once again claimed all survivors of the nation’s concentration camp system who have testified to enduring atrocities there are hired actors, accusing one woman in particular of lying about being forcibly sterilized and claiming she had always been infertile.Extensive documentation and reporting have revealed a network of over 1,000 concentration camps throughout the western Xinjiang region of China, home to the majority of the nation’s Uyghur ethnic minority and several other majority-Muslim communities. For at least three years, Chinese Communist Party officials have admitted to the existence of the camps, but claim that they are “vocational training centers” necessary to help impoverished Uyghurs avoid being recruited into jihad. In reality, the small number of victims who have escaped have testified to communist indoctrination, slavery, and extreme torture, including nightly gang rapes and rape using electric torture devices.The latest installment in China’s ongoing efforts to discredit the mounting evidence that it is committing genocide against ethnic minorities, Xinjiang officials organized a press conference trotting out individuals who allegedly also endured the concentration camps, but claim to be grateful for the experience. An official at the event insisted that every report over the last three years accusing China of genocide against the Uyghur people was “sheer nonsense.”The officials at the press conference took the opportunity to especially attack a woman named Tursunay Ziawudun who told the BBC in a report published last week that Chinese Communist Party officers electrocuted her vaginally as a form of torture and that doctors sterilized her by force prior to her escape from the camp.“The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn’t know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock,” Ziawudun said in the BBC report. “They don’t only rape but also bite all over your body, you don’t know if they are human or animal … They didn’t spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at.”One of the officials at Wednesday’s press conference, Xu Guixiang, claimed that Ziawudun was notoriously infertile before being forced into the concentration camp and that all her allegations were lies.“Tursunay never underwent ‘forced sterilization’ – all her family members know that she is inherently infertile,” Xu claimed.The Global Times quoted Xu as saying that Ziawudun lost her first husband “due to her infertility” and had lied about having a daughter.“Tursunay has shamelessly fabricated her so-called experiences at vocational education and training centers many times. This time she has repeated her same old tricks but the facts are huge slaps in her face,” Xu alleged.Xu did not offer any evidence for this allegation, like a medical record showing her infertility or testimony from her alleged ex-husband. The Global Times also did not mention Xu making any effort to show evidence that her testimony about her rape and torture in the concentration camp was false.Prior to this attack, the Chinese government had openly boasted of measures to limit births in Xinjiang, claiming it a feminist victory that liberated Uyghur women from being “baby-making machines.”The attack on Ziawudun for testifying to the horrors she witnessed is the latest in a wave of such attacks against those accusing the Communist Party of genocide. In 2019, the Party railed against a woman named Mihrigul Tursun who, like Ziawudun, testified to being electrocuted in the concentration camp system and alleges that the Chinese government killed one of her triplet infants while in the facility. A Communist Party official accused Tursun of carrying “syphilis and other infectious diseases” as a way of discrediting her testimony without addressing her allegations.On Wednesday, Xu later attempted to discredit the BBC by claiming that the news agency interviewed concentration camp victims without the permission of the Communist Party.“This has seriously deviated from the professional ethics of journalism, fully exposed the BBC’s malicious intentions to discredit Xinjiang for political purposes, and also destroyed the BBC’s reputation as an internationally renowned media outlet,” Xu claimed.Also at the press conference were alleged concentration camp survivors who claimed the Communist Party treated them fairly and that they were able to have children after their stay there. One woman showed a photo of a toddler, claiming her to be her daughter. The Global Times did not indicate that the woman was related to the child nor any documentation showing that the woman had spent time in a concentration camp.The most recent estimates from the U.S. government, which has deemed the events transpiring in Xinjiang a “genocide,” suggest that about 2 million remain trapped in China’s concentration camp system, down about 1 million people from its peak. Many of those no longer there are believed to have been sold as slaves to factories throughout the country. A study published in March 2020 by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) revealed that at the Chinese Communist Party was openly advertising the sale of Uyghur people online to be used as slaves in factories nationwide, offering companies financial incentives for using them. The study tied Uyghur slave labor to 83 international companies, including household names like Nike and BMW. AsiaNational SecuritySocial JusticeChinaconcentration campsUyghur Muslims.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
521,"It is “extremely unlikely” the coronavirus leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, and is more likely to have jumped to humans from an animal, World Health Organization (W.H.O.) investigators said Tuesday as they wrapped up their visit to the country’s central Hubei province.Peter Embarek, leader of the W.H.O. team, told a media conference instead of investigating laboratories in the country,  frozen meats sold at the wet market in Wuhan where the first cluster of cases was detected should instead be pursued as a line of inquiry.“Our initial findings suggest that the introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely pathway and one that will require more studies and more specific, targeted research,” Embarek said, as reported by AP.“However, the findings suggest that the laboratory incidents hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population,” Embarek said.Peter Embarek, of the World Health Organization team holds up a chart showing pathways of transmission of the virus during a joint press conference held at the end of the W.H.O. mission in Wuhan, China, Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021.

522,"Government health officials in Seoul began testing pet cats and dogs for the Chinese coronavirus this week after South Korea documented its first human case of the virus involving a pet kitten in recent weeks.“The Seoul metropolitan government will test pet cats and dogs for COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] if they show symptoms,” Park Yoo-mi, a Seoul disease control official said at a virtual press conference Monday.“Only cats and dogs exhibiting symptoms, such as fever, coughing, breathing difficulties and increased secretion from the eyes or nose, will be subject to the test,” Park said, adding that most pets have not shown symptoms of the virus.A team of health workers, including a veterinarian, will set up a makeshift site near the pet owner’s home to administer the test.“If the pet tests positive, it will be required to quarantine at home for 14 days without being sent to an isolation facility,” Park said.“If the pet’s owners are unable to take care of it because they are hospitalized with COVID-19 [coronavirus], have an underlying disease, or [are] at an advanced age, the animal will be taken for isolation at a city-run facility in western Seoul,” she added.“Please keep your dogs at least 2 meters away from people and other pets when walking them, and strictly follow antivirus measures, such as wearing masks and washing hands,” the disease control official advised.A government health office in Jinju, a city in South Gyeongsang province, diagnosed the first known case of the Chinese coronavirus in an animal in South Korea on January 24. The three-month-old kitten recovered from the virus by February 4 and was released from quarantine symptom-free. The kitten was one of three cats being cared for by a woman and her daughter, both of whom had recently contracted coronavirus at a “religious facility” in Jinju.“More than 100 people were confirmed to have contracted the virus after visiting the facility last month,” the Seoul-government funded TBS news broadcaster reported on February 4.“The mother and daughter are also said to have made full recoveries,” TBS added.“A small number of pet cats and dogs have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 [coronavirus] in several countries, including the United States. … Most of these pets became sick after contact with people with COVID-19 [coronavirus],” the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in January.There is currently no evidence that the Chinese coronavirus can be transmitted from cats to people, according to Cornell University’s Feline Health Center, “so there is no need for owners to do anything that would endanger the welfare of their cats (i.e. relinquish to a shelter or abandon them) even if a cat is diagnosed with COVID-19 [coronavirus].”There has been no known case of a dog contracting coronavirus in South Korea so far.AsiaHealthNational SecurityCatsChinese coronaviruscoronavirusdogshealthpetsSouth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
523,"Authorities in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin arrested a man on Monday for allegedly fatally stabbing a coronavirus control worker last week.The Harbin prosecutor general’s office approved the arrest of Chen Chenglong, “who is suspected of committing intentional homicide in the murder of an epidemic control volunteer on February 3,” China’s state-run Global Times reported on February 8.Harbin government officials have tightened restrictions on movement and launched mass testing drives amid a recent upsurge in the number of new daily coronavirus cases recorded locally. Epidemic control volunteer Zhang Libin, 42, was posted as a gatekeeper at a Harbin residential complex last Wednesday when he attempted to stop Chen from leaving the community.“He was on duty with another man when Chen approached and said he needed to leave the community to dispose of his rubbish,” the Beijing News reported.“Zhang refused to allow Chen to leave and offered to dispose of the rubbish for him. Chen then took out a knife and stabbed him,” a volunteer infection control worker in Harbin was quoted as saying.Zhang died from his stab wounds on the way to a local hospital, according to a statement from the Harbin police bureau. Chen initially fled the crime scene but was later found and detained by municipal police.The February 3 stabbing in Harbin occurred just ten days after a man in the village of Qinhuangdao, located in northern Hebei province, killed an epidemic control worker on January 24 after he was asked to undergo Chinese coronavirus testing, local criminal prosecutors said.“The villager, who fled but was later detained, refused the check-up and became so angry that he knocked down the worker with his vehicle,” the South China Morning Post reported.“China has been taking strict measures to crack down on illegal behaviors related to epidemic control,” the Global Times noted on Monday.“More than 7,200 people across the country have been arrested for related crimes and over 11,200 people prosecuted” since China’s first documented coronavirus outbreak in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of China said on February 2.Government authorities in Hebei, which surrounds China’s national capital, Beijing, locked down 11 million people across the province at the start of the new year amid a regional upsurge in new coronavirus cases, which included neighboring Shanxi province. Chinese health authorities also sealed off 150 residential communities across Hong Kong — home to nearly 10,000 residents — and major hospitals in Shanghai in January after documenting fresh outbreaks of coronavirus in the cities.AsiaCrimeNational SecurityChinaChinese coronaviruscoronavirusHarbinStabbing.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
524,"The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) announced on Tuesday that its investigation into the origin of the Chinese coronavirus in its home city, the central metropolis of Wuhan, yielded no significant evidence – an unsurprising conclusion given that Chinese officials admitted to destroying early virus samples and other critical evidence last year.The W.H.O. team, working in conjunction with Communist Party experts, spent much of last week visiting sites of interest in Wuhan, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) – the source of much speculation of a potential pathogen leak – and the Huanan seafood market, where Communist Party officials initially claimed the virus had originated. The results of the team’s investigation, as revealed on Tuesday, echoed Chinese government claims that the virus may have originated in a different country and entered China on frozen food products, a theory that most international scientists consider highly unlikely.W.H.O. experts also claimed to find no evidence of any cases of Chinese coronavirus in Wuhan before December 2019. In March 2020, the South China Morning Post published a report, citing leaked Chinese government data, showing that the first diagnosed case of Chinese coronavirus occurred in Wuhan on November 17, 2019. Beijing has yet to confirm or deny the report and the W.H.O. did not address it on Tuesday.No evidence exists of any Chinese coronavirus cases in humans anywhere in the world before November 17, 2019. Some research suggests early cases of coronavirus identified in Italy and Brazil in the same month, but not prior to that date.Liang Wannian, a researcher on the W.H.O.-Communist Party research team, claimed on Tuesday that the first known case of coronavirus in Wuhan was diagnosed on December 8, according to the Global Times state propaganda newspaper. Liang also denied that the Huanan seafood market was the definitive source of the virus and claimed, “there is no evidence showing how the virus was introduced into Huanan seafood market.”Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the W.H.O. team, told reporters that the virus most likely did not originate from the WIV because researchers found no evidence of the virus there when they visited the laboratory.“After days of field studies in Wuhan, the joint team is looking at four hypotheses, including direct transmission from animal-to-human, virus jumping to human through an intermediate host, frozen food route-related transmission and lab-related transmission,” the Global Times quoted Ben Embarek as saying. The newspaper claimed that Ben Embarek described the dubious frozen food theory as “likely.”“Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that handling food or consuming food is associated with COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus],” the official page of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reads. It specifies frozen food handling in its description of food transmission probability.Neither Ben Embarek nor the rest of the investigative team appeared to address the lack of evidence that frozen food can infect individuals – as the CDC noted, there is no evidence in the United States that any food can make a person sick with coronavirus disease, despite no American state shutting down food purchases at major cold-chain distributors like Walmart and major supermarkets.Peter Ben Embarek, of the World Health Organization team, gives a thumbs up as he is led away after a WHO-China Joint Study Press Conference held at the end of the WHO mission in Wuhan, China, Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)Ben Embarek also told reporters there was “no indication” that the virus originated in the WIV, without addressing the impact that Chinese officials destroying evidence linked to the outbreak could have on the team’s ability to find any such indication. The team did not address Chinese government officials destroying early samples of the virus and “disinfecting” the market, a process that would erase any traces of the virus there.Prior to the beginning of the study in January, Ben Embarek told reporters he believed it was “still worth” visiting location like the Huanan market despite the widespread destruction of evidence.“There are information and records everywhere, so it is still worth exploring these places,” he claimed.“Based on comprehensive research and expert opinion, we decided to temporarily manage the pathogen causing the pneumonia as Class II – highly pathogenic – and imposed biosafety requirements on sample collection, transport and experimental activities, as well as destroying the samples,” Liu Dengfeng, an official at China’s National Health Commission, said in May 2020. Liu said the move was necessary to “prevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.”Journalists in Wuhan in early 2020 found the Huanan market closed off to visitors and regularly “disinfected.” While Communist Party officials regularly insisted that the market largely sold conventional seafood, reports from the site identified signs advertising exotic animals that may be potential reservoirs for disease, some of which are not legal to sell in the country.The W.H.O.’s conclusions on Tuesday contradicted Chinese officials in the early days of the pandemic.“The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market,” Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in January 2020, as quoted by Reuters. Gao also claimed an overwhelming number of early cases in Wuhan were directly linked to the Huanan market, which the W.H.O. team did not appear to believe.The team concluded that the W.H.O., finding no evidence in an area where China admitted to destroying evidence, should look for the origin of the virus in other countries.“It’s important to make sure we are not geopolitically bound, as the virus passing from animals to the Huanan market could take a long path involving movement cross borders and travels before reaching the Huanan market,” Ben Embarek said, according to the Global Times.The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly demanded the W.H.O. seek out the source of the coronavirus in the United States, despite no significant evidence suggesting the virus originated there.AsiaNational SecurityScienceChinacommunismcoronavirusWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
525,"The World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) global coronavirus vaccine distribution program has reportedly reserved about 2 million doses for the government of North Korea, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported Thursday, raising questions regarding Pyongyang’s claim that it has yet to see a single case of the disease within its borders.The apparent confirmation from the COVAX program, designed to help underprivileged and developing nations access doses of the several approved vaccines currently circulating globally, follows a report by the Wall Street Journal in early January claiming the communist government of North Korea had reached out to vaccine distributors seeking to purchase doses.Dictator Kim Jong-un has repeatedly referred to North Korea’s coronavirus situation as an emergency and launched programs apparently designed to respond to a pandemic, such as the swift announcement of the construction of the Pyongyang General Hospital last year. North Korea reportedly ran out of building supplies this month for the hospital, leaving the construction of the facility in limbo. Kim also sealed the nation’s borders tightly, particularly the border along the Yalu River with China. Chinese authorities also reportedly expanded border patrols to prevent its own epidemic situation from worsening. Yet Kim’s public health officials have not confirmed a single case of the virus in the country.The revelation that North Korea will receive coronavirus vaccines appeared in a report from COVAX Facility, which is leading the program’s distribution, according to Yonhap. The interim delivery report identified North Korea as the destination for 1.992 million doses of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, manufactured in India. As each person requires two doses to be immunized to the full extent the vaccine allows, this amount will be enough for about 1 million people. North Korea has a population of about 25 million. Pyongyang, the capital, which is off-limits to individuals either considered disloyal to the regime or related to someone considered disloyal to the regime, has about 3 million people.The COVAX revelation appears to confirm a Wall Street Journal report in January citing an anonymous source familiar with the working of Gavi, the organization leading COVAX. The report claimed North Korean officials had formally submitted a request to be part of COVAX distribution, meaning the government was interested in receiving doses of a coronavirus vaccine. The report also claimed North Korean diplomats had secretly begun approaching counterparts in Europe, asking if purchasing locally made vaccines was possible. The report raised eyebrows at the time for the same reason the COVAX confirmation did today: North Korea insists it has no documented evidence of the presence of the Chinese coronavirus anywhere in the country.The use of COVAX also suggests that the government of China, North Korea’s closest ally and partner in the technically ongoing Korean War, has not offered Pyongyang a favorable agreement for the purchase of its main Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate, “Coronavac,” by the Chinese firm Sinovac. While dictator Xi Jinping claimed China would make its vaccine a global public good, in reality, Beijing has been selling the vaccine to willing purchasers and encouraging developing nations to take out predatory loans with China to be used for buying them.Coronavac is one of the least effective vaccines approved by several state powers; researchers confirmed it to be about 50 percent effective last month. Chinese state media outlets declared it “good enough,” despite competitors by American companies Pfizer and Moderna being upwards of 90 percent effective.North Korea continued to boast in its state media organs of tremendous effort spent on fighting “epidemics,” without specifying the Chinese coronavirus as the culprit pathogen or acknowledging any cases of coronavirus disease.“The central emergency anti-epidemic sector is concentrating its efforts on enclosing the territorial land, waters and airspace with strong anti-epidemic walls against the inroads of the vicious virus,” the state’s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported Wednesday, “and tightening discipline and order in all units and fields to make sure that all the people thoroughly observe the anti-epidemic measures taken by the Party and the state.”Part of fighting the “vicious virus,” the outlet reported, was a “positive ideological campaign,” presumably consisting of communist indoctrination. The news service added that “health education,” including teaching citizens tips for fighting contagious disease, was part of the campaign.Wednesday’s report echoed the language regularly appearing in KCNA and the Rodong Sinmun, the state newspaper, for months since the pandemic left China in early 2020. Kim Jong-un personally ordered his underlings to “intensify the anti-epidemic work” in November, “for the security of the state and the well-being of the people.” He did not specify the nature of the work he had ordered, but used the occasion to thank North Koreans for not contracting the virus.“Thank you for your good health, with nobody having fallen victim to the malignant virus,” Kim said at the time.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaHealthNational SecuritycoronavirusKim Jong-unNorth KoreaWorld Health Organization.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
526,"Hong Kong’s new “ambush-style” coronavirus lockdowns have caught residents off guard, with some reporting they were “trapped” inside shops and salons overnight by the last-minute quarantines.The Hong Kong government has been ordering sudden lockdowns across various neighborhoods in recent weeks as part of a mandatory coronavirus testing drive. The lockdown order prohibits residents from leaving the affected area while health officials test locals for the Chinese coronavirus. The testing may take several hours, however, and has stranded people in shops overnight in some cases.“Authorities locked down 17 blocks in Sham Shui Po on Tuesday night but after screening residents, they failed to uncover any cases. One photo from the operation that went viral showed a customer of a hair salon at 263B Ki Lung Street lining up to be tested with his hair still wrapped with plastic, the dye job only halfway done,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday.The salon’s owner, a man surnamed Chan, told the SCMP he was forced to spend the night in his salon after authorities sealed off the area surrounding his business on Tuesday evening. Chan said he had to wait until 10:00 a.m. the next day to re-open his salon and that he was able to resume work only after “police officers removed the barrier tape” that had sealed off the neighborhood.“It was inconvenient,” he said. “But we had to cooperate with the government. If they let you go then you go, otherwise you just have to stay here.”About 30 customers were forced to spend the night in another Hong Kong hair salon on Monday night after authorities issued a similar last-minute lockdown order in the Tsim Sha Tsui neighborhood.“Our staff, guests or people in the entire building are safe,” Hair Peace salon wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday. “For all the guests who stayed in our store last night, we are very sorry for the hard night.”A ten-year-old girl was among the customers trapped in Hair Peace salon on Monday night after her mother dropped her off for a haircut and left the salon to buy food, expecting to return shortly afterward. Before the mother could return, however, local authorities issued the lockdown order, effectively cutting the girl off from contact with her mother.“After the [Hong Kong] Home Affairs Department became aware of the situation, the girl was tested and had her information registered, then she was allowed to leave with her mother at our discretion,” a city government representative said.“At least seven of the 10 lockdown operations conducted since January 23 have failed to identify a single new infection,” the SCMP noted on February 3 of Hong Kong’s new coronavirus testing method. “The government said the lack of any new cases from recent operations was ‘expected’, as the aim was to screen residents before transmission chains could form.”Hong Kong authorities on January 23 locked down an entire section of the Yau Tsim Mong neighborhood, sealing off 150 residential buildings that house an estimated 4,000-9,000 residents after tracing a new coronavirus cluster infection to the area. The city deployed over 1,700 officers from various Hong Kong security services to Yau Tsim Mong to enforce the quarantine, which prohibited residents from leaving their homes unless they presented a negative Chinese coronavirus test result. Hours before the mandate was expected to go into effect, Hong Kong government officials refused to officially acknowledge that they planned to impose the lockdown, confusing Yau Tsim Mong residents and leaving many ill-prepared for the sudden stay-at-home order.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinaChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthHong Konglockdownquarantine.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
527,"The Chinese Foreign Ministry and government-run newspapers in the country launched a campaign Thursday to discredit women who have testified to being raped and tortured in Communist Party-run concentration camps, referring to them as criminals and “actors.”Beijing has repeatedly attempted to smear survivors of its elaborate concentration camp system in far-west Xinjiang province as actors who have made a living somehow out of accusing China of human rights atrocities, providing no evidence for those claims. The Communist Party has also spent years attempting to discredit Dr. Adrian Zenz, one of the top researchers working on compiling evidence of genocide against the Uyghur people and other majority-Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.The latest attacks on those accusing China followed a harrowing BBC exposé in which survivors of the concentration camp system said they were regularly subject to gang rape and tortured by being raped with electric batons, among other atrocities. Some of those sharing their experiences with the BBC included guards and prisoners forced to help the guards by disrobing and tying women up in torture chambers prior to their gang rape. Nearly all of those testifying said that a common characteristic of the concentration camps was that everyone inside could hear the screams of agony of those being tortured while they awaited their turn.Prior to the publication of the BBC story on Wednesday, concentration camp survivors, including some who also spoke to the BBC, had accused China of using the concentration camps to enslave Uyghurs, force them into communist indoctrination to erase their culture and religion, forcibly sterilize women, and kill their infant children.The Chinese government has repeatedly denied all charges. Beijing has confirmed the existence of the concentration camps, but refers to them as “vocational training centers” where poor minority people learn job skills. The Chinese government has also boasted of liberating Uyghur women from being “baby-making machines” by forcibly sterilizing them.On Friday, the Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, published a graph with the names of some of those speaking to the BBC on the record, referring to them as “actors playing victims from Xinjiang who frequently appear in Western media.”“These victims of ‘camps’ in BBC reports cannot offer evidence for their claims. The Western media has a notorious record on factual accuracy in its reporting — for example, making traffic jams a sign of ‘oppression,'” The Global Times claimed, without elaborating on what the “traffic jams” comment was a reference to.The newspaper accused the World Uyghur Congress, a human rights advocacy group dedicated to awareness of China’s genocidal policies against the Uyghur people, of recruiting “actors” in an attempt to overthrow the Chinese government.“The separatist organizations usually choose females, as women and their tears would touch readers and arouse sympathy,” the propaganda outlet claimed. It accused the World Uyghur Congress of being “generally believed to seek the fall of China.”The article then went on to name several of the women in the BBC report and claim that Chinese documentation did not show that those who claimed to be forcibly sterilized endured such an attack. It went on to claim that the BBC “provided almost no information to prove the authenticity” of the testimonies. Contrary to that claim, the BBC did indicate that some of its witnesses had documents, including travel documents, that indicated that those testifying were in the places they claimed to be when they experienced what they denounced. The anonymous concentration camp guard who spoke to the BBC, for example, “provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp,” according to the report.The Global Times concluded by quoting alleged “netizens,” anonymous users of Chinese government-controlled social media, insulting the report.“A netizen called ‘Phil C’ mocked the BBC and wrote that ‘BBC must be pretty poor & budget tight 4 NOT able to afford more expensive ‘supermodel’ to go into this fake dazzling headline!! [sic],” the Global Times relayed. “‘Damn! This face photo has been used multiple times practically for ALL functions.., battered wife, farmer, war victim, janitor, beggar, & now…'”Similar to the Global Times‘ attempts to defend the Chinese concentration camps, the Foreign Ministry insisted Thursday that the Communist Party — responsible for the deaths of 45 million people during the Great Leap Forward alone — had a long history of respecting human rights. Spokesman Wang Wenbin urged reporters to watch a Chinese propaganda showcase called “Xinjiang Is a Wonderful Land” that allegedly discredited the BBC report.“After the founding of the PRC [People’s Republic of China], we have achieved unprecedented progress in women’s liberation and development,” Wang alleged. “Women of all ethnic groups enjoy political rights, rights relating to culture and education, rights of labor and social security, rights relating to property, right of person, and rights relating to marriage and family.”Wang also named several of those in the BBC story and claimed they were actors. Of one woman, Zumrat Dawut, he claimed that she was not forcibly sterilized by allegedly signed a “consent form” for a “tubal ligation.”“This woman has become an actor and a tool for anti-China forces’ attacks on and hyping up of Xinjiang,” Wang said.The Chinese government has previously accused concentration camps victims of “murder” and “rape,” claiming their complaints were not false because they were actors, but because they were fugitives. Beijing has provided no evidence for those claims.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismconcentration campstortureUyghurUyghursXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
528,"A top doctor at the hospital in Omsk, Russia, that treated Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny immediately after his poisoning last summer has died, the hospital said Thursday.“Sergei Maksimishin, who was the deputy chief physician for anesthesiology and resuscitation at Omsk emergency hospital No. 1, died in his ward from a heart attack,” the press service of the Omsk regional health ministry told Russian news site Open Media on February 4. Maksimishin was 55.“There are no special reasons. The man was sick, worried about his relatives, he buried his parents this year. He died at work, in his intensive care unit, where he worked. He was in the hospital, he was placed in the intensive care unit and he died there,” the health ministry’s spokeswoman, Galina Nazarova, told Open Media. The Omsk regional health ministry noted that the cause of Maksimishin’s death was “not coronavirus.”Maximishin worked at the hospital for 28 years and saved thousands of lives, the Omsk region minister of health said in a statement.“He brought people back to full reality. We will miss Dr. Maximishin very much. He left too early and because of this the pain of loss is especially bitter,” Omsk Health Minister Alexander Murakhovsky said.Navalny fell ill on a Russian domestic flight from Tomsk, Siberia, to Moscow on August 20, 2020. His plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, where he was admitted to the Omsk emergency hospital No. 1’s toxicology unit. Navalny was placed in a medically induced coma and airlifted to a German hospital in Berlin two days later. He spent the next five months recovering there from what his German doctors said was poisoning from exposure to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. Navalny has accused the Kremlin of ordering his poisoning, which the Russian government denies.The chief toxicologist at the Omsk emergency hospital No. 1 “who was the first to treat Navalny, Alexander Sabaev, said he initially suspected poisoning and that he and his colleagues treated him accordingly,” Reuters reported in September.“Navalny was put on a ventilator and into an induced coma and given the emergency drug atropine,” Sabaev said. This treatment protocol “is in line with usual treatments of Novichok victims,” a medical source who said he was familiar with Navalny’s German test results told Reuters. Atropine is among the first treatments used to counteract the immediate effects of Novichok, which include slowing heart rate, fluid filling the lungs, and nerve damage.Sabaev said he and his fellow doctors at the Omsk hospital changed their minds on the suspected poisoning after Navalny’s test results were returned six hours later showing no traces of poison in his system.“As a toxicologist I am sure. There was no Novichok there,” Sabaev said.Navalny likely suffered from “a metabolic disorder” as opposed to a poisoning, Sabaev said, adding that Navalny’s “blood sugar levels were four times higher than normal and that he had pancreatic problems.”Reuters noted that it had interviewed “other Omsk-based medical sources” who disputed Sabaev’s “metabolic disorder” diagnosis.Moscow police arrested Navalny upon his return to Russia on January 17 for violating probation terms of a previous sentence. Authorities sentenced Navalny to nearly three years in prison for the violation on February 3.AsiaHealthNational SecurityAlexei NavalnydeathdoctorhealthhospitalKremlinRussiaSiberia.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
529,"Australia on Thursday called on the United Nations to investigate reports revealing that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has instituted a system in which Uyghur and other ethnic minority women in the nation’s concentration camps are “systematically raped, sexually abused, and tortured.”The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported on February 3 that “several former detainees and a guard” at the state-run Xinjiang concentration camps told the BBC “they experienced or saw evidence of an organized system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture.”Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne responded to the claims in a statement issued by her spokesperson on February 4.“These latest reports of systematic torture and abuse of women are deeply disturbing and raise serious questions regarding the treatment of Uyghurs and other religious and ethnic minorities in Xinjiang,” the statement read.“We consider transparency to be of utmost importance and continue to urge China to allow international observers, including the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to be given immediate, meaningful, and unfettered access to Xinjiang at the earliest opportunity,” the spokesperson added.China’s foreign ministry reacted to the statement by its Australian counterpart hours later at a regularly scheduled press briefing.“China has extended invitation long ago to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and we are in communication on this with the UNHCHR. We welcome fair-minded foreigners to visit Xinjiang and learn the real situation there,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on February 4.“At the same time, we are firmly opposed to interference in China’s internal affairs by any country or individual under the pretext of human rights, and to the hyping-up of the so-called ‘investigation’ in Xinjiang by someone who is already convinced that we are guilty,” Wang added.Later at the press conference, Wang refuted the BBC’s February 3 report, stating, “There is no so-called ‘systemic sexual abuse and mistreatment against women,’” in China.Human rights organizations accuse regional Chinese government officials of detaining 1 to 3 million Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang detention camps since at least 2017.

530,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Thursday “there is no such thing” as LGBT during a speech denouncing a recent anti-government protest movement launched at an Istanbul university last month.“The LGBT, there is no such thing,” Erdoğan said. “This country is … moral, and it will walk to the future with these values.”Erdoğan’s comments on Thursday came in response to a recent incident at Istanbul’s Bogazici University in which protesters displayed a poster depicting Mecca – Islam’s holiest site in Saudi Arabia, which all Muslims pray towards – with various LGBT flags and symbols.“The poster placed a mythical creature of half-woman and half-snake found in Middle Eastern folklore on the site of worship along with the flags of LGBT, lesbian, trans and asexual people. The text below said the artwork was a critique of traditional gender roles,” according to the Associated Press.Istanbul police on January 30 arrested two people on charges of “inciting hatred and insulting religious values” for helping to display the poster at a protest exhibition at the university. While Turkey is a secular nation with no official state religion, it is currently ruled by the Islamist Justice and Development Party (AKP), which is led by Erdoğan.The January 30 protest at Bogazici University was organized in response to Erdoğan’s appointment of AKP member Melih Bulu as the university’s rector at the start of the new year. Protests against the appointment began the day before Bulu was sworn in as rector on January 5 and have continued unabated since then, with clashes between thousands of ralliers and police leading to hundreds of arrests.The demonstrations have recently escalated and spread beyond the Bogazici University campus to other parts of Istanbul and have inspired sister protests nearly 300 miles away in the national capital, Ankara. Turkish police said they arrested more than 300 protesters across Istanbul and Ankara this week.In a statement released January 5, some faculty members at Bogazici University said they were protesting Bulu’s appointment because he “was the first rector appointed from outside a university [in Turkey] since a 1980 military coup and part of increasing anti-democratic practices since 2016,” referring to a failed coup that prompted Erdoğan’s government to crack down against perceived opposition leaders in the country.Erdoğan referred to the anti-Bulu protesters as “terrorists” in a televised speech on February 4.“Are you students or terrorists who dare to raid the room of the rector?” the president asked, before adding: “This country will not be a place where terrorists prevail. We will never allow this.”Erdoğan then drew comparisons to the 2013 Gezi protest movement, which similarly began as student rallies in Istanbul opposing government plans to demolish a local park before spreading nationwide.“This country will never experience another Gezi event,” the president vowed.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsLGBTRecep Tayyip ErdoganTurkey.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
531,"Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg drew the ire of police prosecutors in India on Thursday after she used social media to offer running commentary and advice on violent protests by the country’s farmers.The 18-year-old left-wing eco-activist shared — and then quickly deleted — a message that detailed a list of “suggested posts” about the ongoing civil disorder, according to a report in the NY Post, which her critics say reveals she is being coached on what position to take by outsiders.The list gave a series of tips on what to post on social media, asking her to also repost and tag other celebrities tweeting about it, including pop star Rihanna.As well as the Twitter storm, the “toolkit” she shared also suggested highlighting planned demonstrations at Indian embassies.The Delhi Police on Thursday filed a case against the activist over her tweets while rejecting foreign intervention on purely domestic matters.I still #StandWithFarmers and support their peaceful protest.No amount of hate, threats or violations of human rights will ever change that. #FarmersProtest— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) February 4, 2021We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India. https://t.co/tqvR0oHgo0— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) February 2, 2021For her part, Rihanna tweeted to her more than 101 million followers: “Why aren’t we talking about this?!” She linked to a CNN news report about India blocking internet services at the protest sites, a tactic of the government to thwart protests.Senior government ministers, Indian celebrities and even the foreign ministry are now urging people to come together and denounce “outsiders” like Thunberg and Rihanna who try to “break the country.”“It is unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them,” India’s foreign ministry said Wednesday in a rare statement criticizing “foreign individuals” posting on social media. It did not name Rihanna and others who followed suit.Tens of thousands of farmers have been hunkering down at the Indian capital’s fringes to protest new agricultural laws they say will leave them poorer and at the mercy of corporations.

532,"A growing chorus of Communist Party-approved Chinese scientists are demanding the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) send a team of investigators to find the origin of the Chinese coronavirus in America and Europe, the state-run propaganda outlet Global Times reported Thursday.A group of W.H.O. investigators is currently in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated in late 2019. Chinese officials admitted to destroying most of the relevant evidence regarding the origin of the pandemic in early 2020, leaving little for the investigators to find over a year later. The team has claimed that Communist Party officials have allowed them to investigate key locations like the Huanan seafood market, where the first cases of confirmed Chinese coronavirus infection reportedly originated, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which Trump administration officials claimed may have had a pathogen leak that caused the outbreak.The W.H.O. team has issued statements claiming the Wuhan investigation is yielding valuable information, but have yet to specify what that information is and have insisted they do not have enough information to reach concrete conclusions about how the coronavirus pandemic began.Chinese government documents leaked to the South China Morning Post revealed last year that the first documented case of Chinese coronavirus, then a novel pathogen, was diagnosed in Wuhan on November 17, 2019. No evidence exists of any human cases existing anywhere in the world before that date.The official stance of the government of China is that the virus originated at a U.S. Army facility in Maryland, a claim for which it has presented no evidence.Despite this, the Global Times cited Chinese “experts” to make the case that the W.H.O. should send teams to the United States to investigate the origin of the virus.“The U.S. has the most diverse virus strains, which make it the most suitable place for conducting study of origins,” one alleged expert told the propaganda newspaper. The newspaper also claimed that cases of Chinese coronavirus were documented prior to the Chinese cases in America, as well as Spain, Italy,. France, Brazil, and India — a claim for which it provided no evidence. As the Chinese government has not publicly confirmed the South China Morning Post leak, it does not consider the November 17 date an official earliest case.“With more evidence of early cases emerging in other countries, including the US, Spain, Italy, France, Brazil and India, some even earlier than the cases reported in Wuhan, the W.H.O. should follow those clues and continue carrying out field studies in the coming months, some experts suggested,” the newspaper insisted.One of the experts speaking to the Global Times not just urged investigations for the origin of the virus outside of China, but definitively stated that no “answer” was to be found in Wuhan, the origin city of the pandemic.“Wuhan is just a stop for virus origin tracing, and those experts should not expect to find an answer here,” Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, said. “Also, it is scientifically impossible, as there were cases found in other countries even before the outbreak in Wuhan was reported.”Another “expert” identified as Wang Guangfa insisted, again without evidence, that “it’s unlikely” that the Chinese coronavirus originated in China, blaming “travelers” or “other means” for its introduction into China.One of those means Beijing has been fielding is the possibility that foreign imported food packaging carried the virus on it. The Chinese government has blamed foreign frozen food for several outbreaks nationwide after the initial Wuhan epidemic subsided in March. International public health officials have repeatedly denied that any evidence exists suggesting that food packaging, including frozen food, is a significant factor in the spread of the virus.The Chinese government has spent months attempting to seed skepticism in the widely accepted conclusion that the Chinese coronavirus originated in China. Last month, China’s National Health Commission issued a formal request to the W.H.O. to launch an investigation into the origin of the virus outside of China. Beijing similarly made pleas for global investigations into the virus’s origin last year.W.H.O. officials have made remarks that make the organization appear receptive to the theory that the virus originated outside of Wuhan.“There are gaps in the epidemiological landscape and what is required is going to be a much more extensive retrospective epidemiological study to look at those first cases and clusters in Wuhan and to fully understand the links between those cases so that we can then determine at what point in Wuhan or elsewhere was the animal-human species barrier breached,” Michael Ryan, the W.H.O.’s executive director of the Health Emergencies Program, said in August. “Again, one must remember that there was a specific surveillance system in place in Wuhan for picking up clusters of atypical pneumonia … The fact that that fire alarm was triggered doesn’t necessarily mean that is where the disease crossed from animals into humans.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacommunismcoronavirusUnited StatesWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
533,"A coalition of human rights advocates representing groups repressed by the Chinese Communist Party — including members of the Tibetan, Uyghur, Inner Mongolian, and Hong Kong communities — issued a call Thursday for the world to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, set to take place in Beijing.The groups urged the government of the United States, in particular, to join the boycott, as the world’s leading nation, in the name of those currently suffering human rights atrocities at the hands of the government hosting the games.Beijing, dominated by the ethnic Han Chinese majority, is implementing policies the administrations of both Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden have deemed genocidal against the Uyghur people, the majority of whom live in western Xinjiang, China. The Communist Party has built hundreds of concentration camps for Uyghur and other majority-Muslim communities in the region, systematically sterilized women in the community, and stands accused of harvesting bodies of political prisoners to sell their organs. A report published by the BBC this week, citing eyewitnesses and victims who went on the record, described extremely gruesome torture used against Uyghur women, particularly the implementation of systematic gang rape in the concentration camps and the rape of women using electric instruments as a form of electroshock torture.The Communist Party has also implemented a labor camp policy in occupied Tibet, in addition to enforcing the use of the Han Mandarin language, which is not native to Tibet, and attempting to control the leadership of the majority religion there, Tibetan Buddhism. Similarly, Beijing has implemented a policy of language and cultural erasure in Inner Mongolia, which has triggered widespread protests and corresponding state violence.In Hong Kong, the Communist Party illegally imposed a “national security” law last year that allows it to imprison political dissidents for a minimum of ten years if found guilty of crimes such as “subversion of state power.”A coalition of 150 groups representing these communities and human rights activists generally issued an open call on Tuesday to boycott the Winter Olympics in Beijing to “ensure they are not used to embolden the Chinese government’s appalling rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent.”Beijing hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008, which the groups note preceded the outrageous abuses now taking place in the country.“The IOC [International Olympic Committee] refused to listen in 2008, defending its decision with claims that they would prove to be a catalyst for improved human rights,” the groups’ statement read. “As human rights experts predicted, this decision proved to be hugely misplaced; not only did China’s human rights record not improve, but violations increased substantially without rebuke.”“Now, in 2021, we find ourselves back in the same position with the IOC who are refusing to act despite the clear evidence of genocide and widespread and worsening human rights failures,” the letter continued. Given the inaction on the part of Olympics officials, the group urged sovereign states to act, concluding, “anything less will be seen as an endorsement of the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian rule and blatant disregard for civil and human rights.”At a press conference Thursday in Tokyo, a year from the day the Winter Olympics are scheduled to start, the group reiterated the need for collective international rejection of China’s human rights atrocities. Hidetoshi Ishii — vice president of the Free Indo-Pacific Alliance, one of the groups in the coalition — emphasized that support from Washington would send a strong message that China’s abuses are unacceptable.“This is not something that only Japan can do, so we want the international community to act together. We want the new Biden administration to join us,” Ishii said, according to Reuters.As Reuters noted, no evidence suggests that Biden would support such a boycott. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki explicitly rejected the idea this week.The Chinese Communist Party responded to the letter on Wednesday, disparaging the activists as “irresponsible” for reminding the world of China’s dire human rights record.“As we said before, Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics will be another significant contribution China makes to the Olympic Movement. All winter games lovers are looking forward to taking part in Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said during his regular briefing Wednesday. “All preparation work for the games are well underway, which have won full recognition from the international community including the IOC. We are fully confident that the Beijing Winter Olympics will be a splendid event.”“In the meantime, I must point out that it is highly irresponsible for some parties to try to disrupt, intervene and sabotage the preparation and holding of Beijing Winter Olympic Games to serve their political interests,” he concluded. “Such actions will not be supported by the international community and will never succeed.”The president of the IOC, Thomas Bach, did not indicate in his message to mark one year until the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics that he was aware of any widespread calls for a boycott.“Having seen how China is overcoming the coronavirus crisis, we are very confident that our Chinese hosts will ensure safe and secure Olympic Games in full cooperation with the IOC,” Bach said in his message, disregarding the widespread coronavirus outbreaks currently plaguing the country, including in Beijing. “Every time that I have visited China, I am so impressed by the enthusiasm and support for the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022. This is why, we can say already now with great confidence: China is ready.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecuritySportsBeijing OlympicsChinaconcentration campsInner mongoliaInternational Olympic CommitteeOlympicsracismTibetUyghurUyghurs.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
534,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) released a video Thursday warning President Joe Biden has, in his first few weeks in office, given the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) a “warm embrace” with his selection of cabinet members.The video from Cruz, who has hammered Biden repeatedly about China since the president’s cabinet nominee hearings began, presents a compilation of concerns with certain nominees, some of whom have now been confirmed as U.S. secretaries in their respective departments.“China poses the single greatest geopolitical threat to the United States over the next century,” Cruz begins in the video, which then switches to a clip of him saying, “One of the really disturbing patterns we’ve seen with Biden nominee after Biden nominee is a warm embrace of China”:America needs to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable.Yet Team Biden has decided to embrace China. pic.twitter.com/0un2apopUJ— Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) February 4, 2021The video flashes images of cabinet nominees, including U.N. ambassador nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield, commerce secretary nominee Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-RI), and now-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.Cruz first in his video highlights Thomas-Greenfield, whom the Foreign Relations Committee approved on Thursday 18–4 and now awaits her Senate confirmation. Cruz was the most critical of the U.N. ambassador nominee during her hearing and one of the senators to vote against her Thursday, primarily because of a 2019 speech she gave at a Confucius Institute at Savannah State University in Georgia in which she praised China’s aggressive investment practices in Africa.Thomas-Greenfield said during her hearing that she regretted the speech and had intended to deliver foreign affairs advice to young people at Savannah State, a historically black public university. She acknowledged China’s “self-interested and parasitic goals in Africa” and said she had meant to convey that “Africans need to open their eyes on how they deal with the Chinese, and I would like to see the U.S. government do more in Africa to compete.”Cruz argued during his committee vote, however, that “the speech she gave does not have one single critical word about China” and also pointed out that Confucius Institutes are CCP-funded mouthpieces for the Chinese government and that it remained alarming that she had spoken at one.The Texas Republican’s video compilation then shifts to Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant he describes as a “global espionage company masquerading as a telecom company.”Cruz asked Raimondo during her hearing if she could commit to keeping Huawei and other Chinese technology companies on the Entity List, which is maintained by the Commerce Department, and Raimondo dodged his question, only saying, “I will commit to working with you on that.”Cruz referenced this exchange as reason for rejecting her nomination, but despite his opposition, Raimondo was approved Wednesday by the Commerce Committee 21–3 and now awaits a full Senate confirmation vote.The video he put out also features Mayorkas, a former director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) who Cruz pointed out was accused in a 2015 inspector general report of doing political favors for “well-connected Democrat stakeholders” under the EB-5 visa program and allegedly secured such a visa for a Huawei vice president.A Biden transition official defended Mayorkas, according to Politico, saying the now-secretary had at the time “inherited a ‘badly broken’ visa system and ‘took a series of steps to proactively reform the EB-5 program and strengthen the quality and integrity of the process.’”Write to Ashley Oliver at aoliver@breitbart.com.AsiaPoliticsAlejandro MayorkasBiden cabinetChinaChinese Communist PartyGina RaimondoJoe BidenLinda Thomas-GreenfieldTed Cruz.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
535,"China warned Sunday any country that boycotts the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics can expect “serious sanctions” as the Chinese Communist Party continues to reject allegations of “genocide” against Uyghur Muslim minorities.British and U.S. lawmakers have together called for a boycott over Beijing’s ethnic cleansing against Uyghurs who have been imprisoned and subjected to political “re-education” and mass surveillance in Xinjiang, as Breitbart News has reported.The lawmakers joined a coalition of 180 rights advocacy groups and politicians have made demands for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to take the event out of China, casting a pall on Beijing’s efforts to highlight the Games.But Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-controlled Global Times, warned Sunday “China will seriously sanction any country that follows such a call” and called China’s critics “just a band of disordered people.”First he took to social media to issue his threat:Boycotting 2022 Beijing Winter Games, an unpopular idea, won’t receive wide support.

China certainly has the resources and means to do that.[…]A boycott by the U.S. and the UK would be seen as a farce even in their own countries, with huge resistance and associated uncertainty.Several U.S. Republican senators led a resolution to move the Beijing Winter Games last week, following the United States’ designation that China’s actions in the region was “genocide” in the last days of the Donald Trump presidency.The U.S. government has so far said it had no intention of telling its athletes not to go.There has been speculation the Biden administration could push it to seek allied backing for a boycott in 2022, something a U.S. president has not done since Jimmy Carter blocked American athletes from attending the 1980 Summer Games in the former Soviet Union.Beijing 2022, which will be the largest Winter Games yet with 109 medals on offer, is set to begin on February 4 next year.This will be China’s first time hosting the Winter Olympics, after holding the Summer Games in Beijing in 2008.

536,"A report from Freedom House called Out of Sight, Not Out of Reach: The Global Scale and Scope of Transnational Repression describes growing efforts by authoritarian nations like China, Russia, Turkey, and Iran to silence critics and dissidents living overseas, sometimes by murdering them.According to Freedom House, China is by far the worst offender, with Turkey in second place. Rounding out the top six countries with “aggressive campaigns of transnational repression” were Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Iran. A total of 31 states were identified as perpetrators of “physical transnational repression” against targets living in 79 host countries.Turkey’s program of transnational repression intensified considerably after the failed 2016 coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, becoming “remarkable for its intensity, its geographic reach, and the suddenness with which it escalated.”“The campaign is also notable for its heavy reliance on renditions, in which the government and its intelligence agency persuade the targeted states to hand over individuals without due process, or with a slight fig leaf of legality,” the report said. Freedom House identified 58 political renditions from Turkey since 2014, from host countries spread around the world, and said even this number “is almost certainly an undercount.” Despite spirited efforts across two U.S. administrations and counting, Turkey has not yet been able to extradite the alleged mastermind of the coup, exiled religious leader Fethullah Gulen, from his home in Pennsylvania. Gulen denies any involvement and Erdogan’s government has failed to disclose any significant evidence linking him to the event.Turkey is also aggressively using transnational repression techniques against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a militant Kurdish separatist group with a long history of violence. Freedom House conceded the PKK is a legitimate security threat for Turkey but criticized the methods used against PKK suspects overseas as excessive and sometimes “unlawful.”In addition to rendition, the tools of transnational repression include “assassinations, illegal deportations, abductions, digital threats, Interpol abuse, and family intimidation.” China, the undisputed master of these dark arts, employs all of those tools liberally but is particularly adept at family intimidation. Freedom House crowned China’s system as “the most sophisticated, global and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression” in its report.Of all the perpetrator nations identified in the report, China is the only one that has essentially set up a network of transnational repression franchises in nearly every country where Chinese dissidents can be found. Freedom House described it as a “multi-faceted transnational repression bureaucracy” and noted top Chinese Communist officials speak openly of the need to conduct an “overseas struggle” against perceived enemies of the Party.China brings far more advanced technology to the task than any of its competitors, it targets vast ethnic and religious groups for repression, it “does not hesitate” to use every ounce of its “geopolitical weight” against its targets, and it is not shy about targeting foreign nationals in addition to Chinese living abroad, including “human rights defenders, journalists, and others who criticize the CCP.”“The concentration of power under CCP general secretary Xi Jinping and his emphasis on assertive foreign policy has led to an ever-more aggressive stance in Chinese foreign policy, which includes transnational repression,” the report noted.Most of the other perpetrating nations named by Freedom House were more likely than China to simply assassinate troublemakers overseas, especially Iran, Russia, and nations that were once satellites of the Soviet Union. A disturbing tendency outlined in the report is the growing skill of repressive nations at manipulating the political, legal, and media structures of free countries to intimidate or attack dissidents abroad. China is, again, the paramount grand master of such tactics, but others are learning how to push the buttons of liberal democracies by using allegations of terrorism and corruption against their targets and using the Internet to harass them.The report stressed that people living in the United States, the United Kingdom, or other nominal fortresses of freedom are not fully protected against transnational repression. Family intimidation is such an effective instrument because there is virtually nothing an expatriate or refugee’s host nation can do about it.One case study in the report was Iranian dissident journalist Masih Alinejad:In 2018, her sister in Iran was forced to go on state TV to denounce her. In September 2019, her brother Alireza was arrested in Iran and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. In April 2020, her mother was also detained and questioned. Like many other Iranian journalists abroad, Alinejad says she receives constant digital and physical threats against her life.One of the more famous victims of transnational repression spotlighted by Freedom House was Paul Rusesabagina, whose efforts to save Rwandan victims of ethnic cleansing were portrayed in the 2004 American film Hotel Rwanda. Rusesabagina lived in Europe and the United States after the events depicted in the film but remained a persistent critic of the Rwandan government.“In August 2020 the Rwandan government kidnapped him while he was transiting through Dubai, United Arab Emirates. After being held for at least three days incommunicado, he reappeared in custody in Rwanda, where he was charged with terrorism,” Freedom House wrote.Freedom House concluded with a raft of policy proposals for combating transnational repression, some of which amounted to simply acknowledging the problem exists and training domestic law enforcement to handle it. Imposing targeted sanctions against the perpetrators of transnational repression was also recommended.AsiaNational SecurityChinaFreedom HouseIranOppressionRussiaTurkey.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
537,"Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic minority survivors of China’s brutal concentration camp system told the BBC in an extensive report published Wednesday that they witnessed and endured rape at the hands of Chinese government agents on a regular basis, including the use of electric batons to rape and torture women.China has been operating concentration camps in Xinjiang, its westernmost and largest region, since at least 2018. While estimates suggested as many as 3 million people were imprisoned in the concentration camp system at its peak, the most recent estimates from the U.S. government suggest a population of about 2 million people remain trapped there. The number dropped after reports that the Chinese Communist Party sold concentration camp victims as slaves to factories nationwide. Beijing officials claimed the missing prisoners had simply “graduated” from the camps.China admits to building and maintaining the camps, but claims they are “vocational training centers” where members of local majority-Muslim ethnic minorities, particularly members of the Uyghur community, can learn the trade skills they need to compete with Han Chinese peers in the modern Chinese economy.While survivors, including some cited in the BBC report, have for years testified to the systematic rape of Uyghur women in concentration camps, some of the harrowing testimony in the BBC’s exposé add new detail to the extent of the torture people in the camps suffered. A particularly gruesome claim is that Chinese Communist Party guards used electric batons to rape women, then electrocute them from the inside.Tursunay Ziawudun, one of the survivors who spoke to the BBC on the record, said she endured 9 months in a concentration camp and endured torture and gang-rape routinely. The rape of women occurred “every night” in the camp, she said, and other women could hear the screams of agony from their rooms while they awaited their turn. Describing one instance, Ziawudun stated that she watched a woman go into the torture chamber before being taken herself.“The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn’t know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock,” she explained. “They don’t only rape but also bite all over your body, you don’t know if they are human or animal … They didn’t spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at.”Another woman, Qelbinur Sedik, an ethnic Uzbek, told the BBC that she witnessed “gang rape” and regular electrocutions, offering a similar testimony to Ziawudun’s. She described four kinds of electric torture: “the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick.”“Yes, the rape has become a culture. It is gang rape and the Chinese police not only rape them but also electrocute them. They are subject to horrific torture,'” Sedik elaborated.The Chinese guards often used ethnic minority women in their rape and torture of the others, according to the report. Another woman who spoke to the BBC said she was forced during her year and a half in the concentration camp to disrobe and restrain rape victims prior to the attacks.“My job was to remove their clothes above the waist and handcuff them so they cannot move,” the Kazakh woman, Gulzira Auelkhan, said. “Then I would leave the women in the room and a man would enter — some Chinese man from outside or policeman. I sat silently next to the door, and when the man left the room I took the woman for a shower.”Auelkhan said that the men committing the rapes did not appear to be guards in the prison, but clients — suggesting the Chinese government is making a profit from systematic gang rape.The rapists, Ziawudun said, always wore masks.The Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly denied these claims and did so again Wednesday, following the publication of the BBC report.“People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang live in peace and contentment, unity and harmony, and … all their legal rights are effectively guaranteed,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Wednesday. “The BBC report on alleged abuses of women’s rights in Xinjiang you mentioned has no factual basis at all. There are simply no ‘re-education camps.'”Wang went on to accuse the survivors of the camps of being “actors.”On Thursday, Wang boasted of a propaganda initiative Beijing organized at the United Nations titled “Xinjiang Is a Wonderful Land.” Wang said concentration camp survivors discussed their happy lives in the camps in videos shown at the event.“Representatives of graduated trainees from former vocational education and training centers appeared at the event and told stories of how they were influenced by extremism and how their lives have been changed after learning skills and graduating from the centers,” he said.During the same press briefing, asked again about the BBC allegations, Wang denied the existence of the concentration camps and called them “schools.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismconcentration campshuman rightsUyghurUyghursXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
538,"Hong Kong’s education ministry released guidelines on Thursday to teach schoolchildren as young as six years old to abide by the city’s national security law, imposed by China on Hong Kong last summer.The Hong Kong education bureau published extensive guidelines for the new curriculum on February 4, along with an animated video that teaches the national security law’s basic concepts to primary school students.Under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy, China is legally bound to allow Hong Kong to establish its own laws and not obey Beijing’s since Britain returned the city to China in 1997. Violating the policy, China illegally imposed a “national security” law on the city in June 2020 to curb a pro-democracy protest movement that had swept Hong Kong since the previous summer. The law established new crimes — including secession, terrorism, and subversion of state power — punishable with up to life in prison. The minimum sentence for those found guilty is ten years in prison.“Students made up nearly 40 percent of those arrested during the height of the demonstrations,” the New York Times noted on Friday, a statistic that led many Hong Kong government officials to accuse teachers of “corrupting young minds and turning them against Hong Kong and China.” The Hong Kong education bureau’s new national security law guidelines seem to confirm Beijing’s lack of trust in the city’s schools to produce sufficiently obedient pupils.Children in primary schools will be required to learn how to “sing and respect” China’s national anthem, as part of an emphasis on building a sense of pride in Communist Party identity. The guidelines encourage schools to “organize various game activities, such as puppet theatre, board games … to establish a good atmosphere and improve students’ understanding of national security.” The education bureau will incorporate the new curriculum into wide-ranging subjects, including geography and biology, “to enhance students’ sense of national identity.”“National security is of great importance. Teachers should not treat it as if it is a controversial issue for discussion as usual,” the guidelines state.

In middle school, we can study further.”“In general, we are pointing to the concept of national security, and hope to train students to consciously take up the responsibility of upholding national security,” Yeung said, as quoted by the New York Times.AsiaEducationNational SecurityChildrenChinaHong KongNational Security law.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
539,"India seeks to arm allied countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) with various heavy weapons systems including missiles, radar, and tanks, the Indian defense ministry said on Thursday.“India is ready to supply various types of Missile systems, Light Combat Aircrafts/Helicopters, Multi-Purpose Light Transport aircraft, Warship and Patrol Vessels, Artillery Gun systems, Tanks, Radars, Military Vehicles, Electronic Warfare Systems, and other weapons systems to IOR countries,” Indian defense minister Rajnath Singh said on February 4 during a keynote address at the IOR’s inaugural Defense Ministers’ Conclave (DMC), which is a forum promoting the development of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indian Ocean region.The southern Indian city of Bengaluru hosted the IOR conference on February 4, which was timed to coincide with the 13th annual AeroIndia show, Asia’s largest military aviation exhibit, held February 2-5 at Bengaluru’s Yelahanka air force base.In a short while from now, I shall be addressing the inaugural ceremony of @AeroIndiashow in Bengaluru. #AeroIndia2021 pic.twitter.com/wc5N6uuPhu— Rajnath Singh (@rajnathsingh) February 3, 2021“Many of the IOR countries are becoming globally competitive and are developing new technologies, including defense shipyards for design and shipbuilding, which can be jointly harnessed through regional cooperation efforts,” Singh said in Bengaluru.Earlier on February 3, Singh said that New Delhi “could take on the role of being the net security provider in the IOR,” as India is the largest country in the IOR bloc, which includes 28 member states encircling the Indian Ocean, and controls a vast coastline in the region.The IOR should focus on “security, commerce, connectivity, [the] fight against terrorism and inter-cultural exchanges among participating countries,” Singh said on February 4. India’s defense and aerospace industry presents “a significant and attractive opportunity for international companies across the supply chain to take their cooperation to newer levels,” he added.Singapore’s defense minister, Dr. Ng Eng Hen, participated in Thursday’s IOR conference. In a pre-recorded message, Ng addressed “the importance of keeping Sea Lines of Communication above the fray of sovereign disputes and contestation, which is especially pertinent for maritime nations like India and Singapore, who depend on these global commons for trade and the movement of essential supplies,” alluding to China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.“Singapore will work with like-minded partners to preserve and advance maritime norms that protect these vital waterways, as well as to uphold the principles of freedom of navigation and over-flight in the maritime domain,” Ng added.In addition to countering Chinese expansion in the Indian Ocean region, India has been working to resolve a months-long military standoff with China along their unmarked Himalayan boundary following deadly clashes between their border regiments last year.India’s federal government on February 1 allocated “$18.48 billion for weapons procurement in its 2021-2022 defense budget,” according to Defense News.“Excluding pensions, the new defense budget totals $49.6 billion, an increase of more than 3 percent from the previous year’s $47.98 billion. New capital expenditure of $18.48 billion meant for arms procurement witnessed an increase of about 16 percent from the previous year’s $15.91 billion,” the defense news site reported.The allocation of funds was “the highest-ever increase in capital outlay” for Indian defense in the last 15 years, according to Singh, who thanked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the budget boost on Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaDefenseDefense MinisterIndiaIndian OceanIndo-Pacificmilitary.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
540,"Almost one-quarter of India’s population of 1.36 billion “now have antibodies” against the Chinese coronavirus, according to a survey from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“Nearly 25 percent of the population or every one in four persons in India has shown evidence of past infection of coronavirus, the third national serosurvey conducted by the ICMR revealed,” according to the New Indian Express on January 31.Serology surveys involve testing blood samples for the presence of antibodies, or specific proteins made in response to an infection that may support immunity against future infection. Antibodies against coronavirus typically form about two to three weeks after infection.The ICMR has yet to officially release the findings of its latest serosurvey, but sources familiar with the data told the New Indian Express on Sunday that the health body is expected to announce the new results “within the next few days.”The survey estimates that India’s “actual Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] infection size is 30 crore [300 million] – even as the number of confirmed cases stands at just over 1 crore [10 million],” sources confirmed to the newspaper.“The figures are much higher in many cities, strengthening the epidemiological theory that some cities in the country may be approaching herd immunity as evident in the falling daily numbers of new cases,” an official associated with the survey told the New Indian Express.“Like the previous two surveys, the seropositivity has been found to be way higher particularly in urban slums and generally in urban areas as compared to rural areas,” the unnamed official added.“[N]early one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [coronavirus] in India by Aug 18, 2020,” according to ICMR’s second serosurvey, conducted August-September 2020.The ICMR carried out its third serosurvey from December 2020 through January 2021. It focused on “testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples of 400 randomly selected persons” in 70 districts across 22 states where the ICMR’s previous two serosurveys took place in May and August 2020.The Indian state health body collected “samples from 100 healthcare workers from both government and private facilities in each of these 70 districts … for the antibody tests. Unlike the previous surveys that only looked for antibodies against the viral nucleocapsid, researchers in the third survey also tested for spike protein antibodies which last longer in the bloodstream,” according to the New Indian Express.India currently has the second-highest official coronavirus caseload in the world, after the U.S. These numbers may not fully reflect the global reality as rogue states like Russia, China, and Iran have long stood accused of manipulating its coronavirus data.

That’s why everyone speaks.”Tokyo 2020 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks as reported by the Asahi Shimbun.On Tuesday, Mori said the Games would go ahead “however the coronavirus (pandemic) evolves,” as Breitbart News reported.“We should pass on the discussion of whether we will hold the games or not, but instead discuss how we should hold it,” was Mori’s message for fellow members of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party.AFP contributed to this reportAsiaPoliticsSportsJapansexismTokyo 2020 Olympic GamesYoshiro Mori.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
542,"China reaffirmed its stance as a “friendly neighbor of Myanmar” on Monday hours after Myanmar’s military staged a coup, detaining the country’s top government officials and declaring a one-year state of emergency.“We have noted what happened in Myanmar, and we are learning more information on the situation,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a routine press briefing on February 1.“China is a friendly neighbor of Myanmar. We hope that all parties in Myanmar will properly handle their differences under the constitutional and legal framework and maintain political and social stability,” he added.“As Myanmar’s largest trading partner, China’s trade volume with Myanmar accounts for more than 33 percent of Myanmar’s total trade volume, according to data released by China’s Ministry of Commerce in 2020. Therefore, a stable political situation in Myanmar is conducive to exchanges and development between the two countries,” the Chinese state-run Global Times noted on Monday.Myanmar’s military executed a coup in the early hours of February 1. Soldiers detained Aung San Suu Kyi, who led Myanmar as state counsellor — a role similar to that of a prime minister — along with President U Win Myint and other senior Myanmar politicians in pre-dawn raids.The military declared a one-year state of emergency, revealing that Myanmar Commander-in-Chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing would take charge of the country for the next 12 months. The army said that the seizure of power was necessary because Myanmar’s government had failed to act on the military’s claims of fraud during the country’s parliamentary elections in November. Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party won the November elections, securing a majority of seats in the Myanmar parliament. The army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) has alleged that the NLD committed voter fraud in the election.The actions of Myanmar’s military on Monday “can be seen as an adjustment to the country’s dysfunctional power structure,” China’s Global Times argued this week.“The military and USDP lawmakers together account for only about one-third of the seats in the Myanmar parliament, making it difficult to push their proposals, and they are unable to block proposals from the NLD,” an unnamed political “expert” told the newspaper, noting that “the military and the USDP may feel that their interests could not be guaranteed.”“China has maintained good relations with both the current government and the military, and it hopes that the two sides can reach a compromise through negotiations to maintain peace and stability. They also noted the country should be wary of possible external interference,” the Global Times added.Myanmar is China’s closest ally in Southeast Asia and is a signatory of Beijing’s infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which has established Chinese-made oil and gas lines across the country in recent years. Beijing has maintained close ties with Myanmar in recent months as part of its efforts to build a proposed rail route and seaport in the country that would allow China easier access to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean from its landlocked provinces.AsiaNational SecurityBelt and Road InitiativeBurmaChinacoupcoup d'etatmilitary coupMyanmar.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
543,"Public health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci will appear in a discussion alongside Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan — who claimed last year that the Chinese coronavirus originated not in Wuhan, China, but in “multiple birthplaces around the globe” at an online public health forum for the University of Edinburgh in March, Chinese media outlets reported this week.The March 2 event marks the first public dialogue between Zhong and Fauci on the subject of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic since the two medical professionals began advising their respective nations on how to combat the Chinese coronavirus in late 2019 and early 2020. Zhong and Fauci will launch a series of debates at the University of Edinburgh analyzing the future implications and long-term impacts of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, the Scottish university announced on January 28.“The easing of the epidemic situation in the U.S. will have a positive impact on the country, the world as well as China-U.S. relations, especially for the exchanges between Chinese and U.S. scholars,” Zhong said in an interview with Guangzhou Daily, a provincial Chinese Communist Party (CCP) newspaper, on January 31.Speaking to reporters after a Chinese coronavirus “control event” in Guangzhou province on Sunday, Zhong said he looked forward to his future dialogue with Fauci, adding that they “share some similar views.” Zhong said he will also discuss the Chinese coronavirus pandemic “with experts from Harvard Medical School next week.”Zhong currently leads the Chinese National Health Commission’s expert panel investigating the Chinese coronavirus outbreak in China. He infamously floated a theory in late February 2020 that the Chinese coronavirus — first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 — “might have multiple birthplaces co-existing around the globe.”“Zhong Nanshan, once a hero, has been reduced to a propaganda worker. This recent statement from Zhong is laying the groundwork for blaming others – especially the US – for spreading the #coronavirus to #China. Zhong must know his words are ludicrous and dangerous,” Gordon Chang, a Chinese-American author and lawyer, wrote on Twitter of Zhong’s decision to peddle CCP conspiracy theories without any evidence.The first documented case of Chinese coronavirus in humans occurred in November 2019 in Wuhan, China, according to leaked Chinese government documents. No evidence exists that the virus had jumped from a zoonotic source to humans anywhere else in the world prior to that first case.One year after Zhong claimed the Chinese coronavirus originated outside of China, virologist Shi Zhengli pushed a similar theory in the January 2021 edition of Science Magazine, alleging the virus first arrived in China via imported frozen food packages. In the magazine, Shi “referred to a number of studies that, she said, suggest the virus existed outside of China before Wuhan’s first known case in December 2019,” according to the BBC.“Given the finding of Sars-Cov-2 [the Chinese coronavirus] on the surface of imported food packages, contact with contaminated uncooked food could be an important source of Sars-Cov-2 transmission,” she wrote.

544,"China’s education ministry has vowed to enhance the “physical education and psychological direction” of male youth in response to a recent proposal on “preventing the feminization of teenage boys” by a top government policy advisor, Chinese state media reported on Sunday.Responding to the proposal on January 28, the Chinese Ministry of Education said it will “solve the problems from several aspects including enhancing the research on issues related to youth mental health education,” according to the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times on January 31.Chinese schools nationwide “will be required to … increase their efforts to improve the quality and ability of physical education teachers, and at the same time, appropriately improve the teaching of physical education teachers methods and forms, pay more attention to the cultivation of students’ ‘masculinity’, and continue to add new physical education teachers through multiple channels [sic],” the Chinese Ministry of Education’s official statement in response to the proposal read.“I have discovered through observation that young boys in China are weak, inferior, and timid. It is the ‘feminization’ of boys. The ‘feminization’ trend of Chinese youth, if not effectively managed, will inevitably endanger the survival and development of the Chinese nation,” Si Zefu, a top Chinese government policy advisor, said in May 2020.Si is a member of the Standing Committee of the 13th Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee. He urged China’s government to strengthen “masculinity” education for boys while speaking at China’s national Two Sessions, which are annual coinciding meetings of China’s two main deliberative bodies: the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp legislature, and its advisory body, the CPPCC.“In terms of living environment, children in China currently have the most contact with their mothers from birth, and spend the most time with their mothers after birth; from infancy to high school, they are mainly brought up by grandmothers. Such a long-term living environment, in a ‘mother-in-law’ environment, makes the boys lack of ‘masculinity,'” Si said during China’s May 2020 legislative session.“Many Chinese teenage boys nowadays have the characteristics of weakness, low self-esteem and timidity, and they tend to follow the pretty-boy superstars,” Si added.“Si believed this phenomenon could be attributed to the fact that most teachers in schools from kindergarten to high school stage are women, as well as to the frequent appearance of ‘pretty boys’ in TV and films,” the Global Times recalled on Sunday.In response to Si’s recommendation to address the “feminization of male youth,” the Chinese Ministry of Education said its Humanities and Social Research wing had started an investigation into “the influence of the phenomenon of ‘internet celebrities’ on adolescents’ values ​​and countermeasures.”AsiaEducationNational SecurityChinaEducationhealthmasculinityyouth.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
545,"Representatives of the Taliban meeting with Iranian officials in Tehran declared Tuesday that peace talks between the group and the United States would lead to the end of the current Afghan government and the imposition of a more “Islamic” regime, a condition Washington has rejected since the talks began.Afghanistan is already an Islamic republic, run partially through sharia, or Islamic law. The Taliban considers itself the only legitimate government of Afghanistan and formally refers to itself as the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,” rejecting the existence of Afghanistan’s entire government infrastructure. After nearly two decades of war since the United States invaded in the early 2000s, Taliban representatives agreed to negotiations in Doha, Qatar, where it has established a political office.Under the administration of President Donald Trump, the United States sought a full withdrawal of its military from the country in exchange for an agreement on the part of the Taliban that it would stop harboring terrorists from international jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and that it would stop attacking U.S. forces. This week, the new administration of President Joe Biden accused the Taliban of not abiding by its agreements and expressed doubt Washington would be able to keep its deadline of leaving the country by May.Amid the discord, the Taliban sent representatives to Tehran, looking for a potential ally to strengthen their negotiating leverage.“Based on the agreement, (US-Taliban peace agreement), this government will be dissolved and another government will be formed based on the intra-Afghan negotiations,” Taliban negotiator Suhail Shaheen said Tuesday, according to Afghanistan’s Tolo News, “regarding this issue, we have had some trips to the Islamic Republic of Iran and Russia.”
Khaama Press, another Afghan outlet, quoted Shaheen and his fellow negotiators declaring that, after the conclusion of peace talks with America, “Afghanistan’s new Islamic government will emerge.”“Suhail Shaheen added Taliban’s agreement with the United States is that a new Islamic government would be formed, meaning that the current government would be overthrown, and it will occur as a result of Intra-Afghan peace talks,” Khaama reported. No U.S. officials have claimed that this is the case and have actively expressed support for the government in Kabul. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to the president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, this week to express commitment to protecting the current government structure.“The Secretary highlighted robust diplomatic support for the peace process focused on helping the parties to the conflict achieve a durable and just political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire that benefits all Afghans,” the State Department said in its statement on the call. “[Blinken] shared that the United States is reviewing the February  2020 US-Taliban agreement and whether the Taliban are living up to their commitments to cut ties with terrorist groups, to reduce violence in Afghanistan, and to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Afghan government and other stakeholders.”In remarks to Breitbart News in September, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo highlighted tensions between Kabul and the Taliban as the “central challenge” to long-lasting peace in the country.“In the end, the central challenge is what will the Afghan government look like,” Pompeo said. “What will be the power-sharing arrangement? This is a challenge anytime you have throughout history insurgencies and other times when nations have civil strife. … there will be issues of power-sharing and how the government is established at the center of the conversation.”The Afghan government responded to the Taliban’s remarks by claiming that any discussion of changing the government of Afghanistan was “premature.”“Before talking about the system, the Taliban should stop shedding the blood of inhabitants of this country, it is premature to talk about the system,” Rahmatullah Andar, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s Office of National Security Council (ONSC), said in response.The Pentagon warned last week that the Taliban had increased attacks in Afghanistan and that its disposition towards the peace deal had prompted concern that they would betray it.“We are still involved in trying to get a negotiated settlement. The Taliban have not met their commitments,” John Kirby, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said. “Without them meeting their commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan national security forces, and by dint of that the Afghan people, it’s very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.”Kirby added that American troops could not withdraw from the country if the Taliban did not stick to the commitments negotiated in Qatar in September.A week prior, the U.S. Treasury issued a statement saying it had reason to believe that the Taliban was still cooperating with al-Qaeda, a direct violation of its peace commitments.Tolo News reported on Tuesday that both the Taliban and the Islamic State, rivals to the Taliban in the country, “have increased targeted assassinations outside of Kabul” and that, within the capital, the Taliban had become more violent, citing the U.S. Afghanistan watchdog office, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR).Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAfghanistanal-QaedaAntony BlinkenIranjihadMike PompeoPentagonradical islamTaliban.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
546,"Local Communist Party officials in Xinjiang, China — where the government has established a network of concentration camps imprisoning as many as 2 million members of local ethnic minorities — invited members of President Joe Biden’s administration to visit the region Monday.Most of those imprisoned in concentration camps are members of the local Uyghur ethnic minority, the majority of whom are Muslims. Joining them are members of other ethnic minorities such as Kazakhs and Kyrgyz people, forced into the camps to engage in slave labor and indoctrination. There, they endure extreme torture, rape, and forced sterilization, according to survivors. Shortly before departing his post, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the widespread sterilization and disappearance of Uyghur people in Xinjiang as a “genocide.”Pompeo’s successor, current Secretary of State Antony Blinken, agreed during his confirmation hearing that the situation in Xinjiang is a genocide. Blinken has also publicly praised Trump’s overall policies against the Chinese Communist Party.The agreement between the two otherwise contentious camps prompted an outraged response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, which adamantly denied, once again, that its abuses and extermination of Uyghur people amounted to genocide.On Monday, local officials in Xinjiang offered to give Biden administration officials a guided tour under the auspices of the Communist Party to prove that no genocide was ongoing in the region.“We welcome people from all fields around the world, including officials from the new US administration, to visit Xinjiang to learn what is really happening there and avoid being fooled by Pompeo’s lies,” China’s state-run Global Times newspaper quoted Xu Guixiang, a deputy director-general of the publicity department of the Xinjiang Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), as saying.Xu also claimed China would “welcome foreign reporters to visit Xinjiang at any time,” but added that the invitation did not apply to “any so-called investigation with a presumption of guilt.” He added that Pompeo’s declaration China is committing genocide in Xinjiang was “a piece of waste paper,” suggesting Pompeo would not be an acceptable envoy for the Biden administration to send on a visit.Human rights investigators believe China began building its concentration camps for Uyghurs between 2017 and 2018, and as many as 3 million people have passed through them since then. The Chinese Communist Party has not denied that the camps exists, but refers to them as “vocational training centers” and it claims that prisoners are recruited there to learn trade skills they can use to live fulfilling lives. The camps, the Party claims, are necessary to keep wayward Muslims from joining jihadist groups.In late 2019, Chinese officials announced that the population of the camps had declined significantly because the prisoners had “graduated” from their “vocational training.” Less than a year later, a study by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) revealed that Beijing had begun selling Uyghur people as slaves to factories nationwide, introducing slave labor to facilities manufacturing products for at least 82 international companies, including U.S. staples like Nike and Apple.Chinese officials deny that any slavery is taking place in Xinjiang or elsewhere in the country. To protect its public image, the Communist Party began offering tours to friendly journalists of Xinjiang in 2019, resulting in favorable coverage in friendly media.Journalists attempting to reveal the true situation in Xinjiang have accused China of significantly limiting their access to daily life in the region.“Basically, from the moment we arrive, we’re followed by at least one car. … You can see that the local handlers are trying hard to be professional. They are members of the propaganda department, so they’re PR professionals. They don’t want to make it appear like it’s so stifling,” Yanan Wang, an Associated Press journalist, detailed of a 2019 visit to Xinjiang. “They had all of these interesting tactics to work around the idea that they were trying to obstruct our reporting.”Other journalists have lamented that authentic Uyghur sources in the region appeared to disappear as soon as Chinese officials discovered they were speaking with media.China is the world’s leading jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). The CPJ granted the ignominious title to China for both 2019 and 2020, taking it away from Turkey, which remains in second place.The Chinese Communist Party has disparaged missing Uyghur people whose families abroad are advocating for them as criminals who found themselves behind bars for being a threat to society. Chinese state media has also accused the United States of an alleged genocide against its indigenous population when confronted with the reality of the Uyghur people.Last week, in response to Blinken’s statement that he agreed with Pompeo’s genocide designation, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, repeatedly chanted “China has no genocide” in front of reporters, then accused Blinken of having “malicious purposes” in addressing the human rights catastrophe.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAntony BlinkenChinacommunismconcentration campsJoe BidenMike PompeoUyghurUyghursXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
547,"Lawmakers in Taiwan urged the government Monday to “remove references to unification with mainland China” from the country’s constitution during a session of Taiwan’s legislature.At least 58 members of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) advocated for the changes, arguing they were necessary for Taiwan to become a “normalized country,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported February 1.“Our constitution actually reflects a Greater China mentality and our so-called territory does not reflect our reality — that our jurisdiction only extends to Taiwan, Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu, but not China and even Mongolia,” DPP legislator Chen Ting-fei said.DPP lawmakers on Monday also endorsed a proposal to change Taiwan’s national emblem and anthem, noting they are currently associated with Taiwan’s pro-China opposition party, Kuomintang (KMT).“Our emblem and anthem actually came from the KMT, which should not be used to represent our country,” Chen said.“The emblem, a white sun on a blue background, was adopted by the KMT, or Nationalists, in 1927 when they controlled the Chinese mainland, while the anthem was adopted 1937,” according to the SCMP. “They have remained unchanged since the KMT was defeated by the Communists in the civil war and fled to Taiwan in 1949.”Taiwan’s legislative yuan, which is responsible for passing legislation on the island, has assigned its constitutional amendment committee to discuss the DPP’s proposals this month, the governing body’s speaker and DPP member, Yu Shyi-kun, said on February 1. The committee would need to reach a consensus on the proposal as a first step before putting it forward as a formal motion before the legislature.“A quarter of lawmakers must then approve it being put to a vote, and three quarters must vote in favor for it to trigger a referendum. Finally, it must win the support of 50 percent of all eligible voters for it take effect,” the SCMP noted, adding that the current breakdown of seats held in Taiwan’s legislature makes the proposal’s passage into law nearly “impossible.”The DPP currently holds 61 of the legislature’s 113 seats, while KMT holds 38 seats. The remaining seats are in the hands of other opposition parties.“The move is unlikely to succeed because of the difficulty in changing the constitution, but it reflects consistent efforts by supporters of independence to change the status quo,” the Hong Kong-based newspaper pronounced Monday.A “handful” of people in Taiwan are seeking the island’s independence, China’s defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian said at a monthly news briefing on January 28.“We warn those ‘Taiwan independence’ elements: those who play with fire will burn themselves, and ‘Taiwan independence’ means war,” Wu added.Beijing considers Taiwan to be a breakaway territory and has vowed to reunify the island with China by force. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed fighter jets to conduct over 100 air sorties violating Taiwanese airspace since mid-September as part of a campaign of intimidation against the sovereign island, located off China’s southeastern coast.“Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, and the Taiwan question falls under China’s internal affairs and brooks no interference from any external forces,” Wu said late last month.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaTaiwan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
548,"Senior Chinese foreign policy official Yang Jiechi, one of the top aides to dictator Xi Jinping, on Monday instructed President Joe Biden to abandon the “misguided policies” of his predecessor, Donald Trump. Yang drew a “red line that must not be crossed” against U.S interference in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet, or Xinjiang province.“For the past few years, the Trump administration adopted misguided policies against China, plunging the relationship into its most difficult period since the establishment of diplomatic ties,” Yang told a virtual forum hosted by the New York-based National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. “I hope the new administration will remove the stumbling blocks to people-to-people exchanges, like harassing Chinese students, restricting Chinese media outlets, shutting down Confucius Institutes and suppressing Chinese companies. These policy measures are not only wrong but also unpopular,” Yang said.“We in China hope that the United States will rise above the outdated mentality of zero-sum, major-power rivalry and work with China to keep the relationship on the right track,” he declared.Yang added a warning that China’s crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong, its growing aggression toward Taiwan, its brutal occupation of Tibet, and its vicious oppression of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province are on the far side of a “red line that must not be crossed,” thus signaling total rejection of the human rights concerns expressed by the United States, other Western powers, and human rights groups.“We in China hope that the U.S. side will fully understand the sensitivity of these issues and handle them with prudence, so as to avoid disruption or damage to mutual trust and cooperation,” he said.Yang insisted that the ruling Communist Party has the “wholehearted support” of the Chinese people, contradicting the Trump administration’s portrayal of the Chinese as frightened captives of a harsh dictatorship.The South China Morning Post described Yang as “the highest-ranking official so far to comment on the bilateral relationship since Biden’s inauguration nearly two weeks ago.” “Yang’s message to the U.S. was consistent with a view in Beijing that the U.S.’s erratic policies were being driven by deepening fissures in American society, rather than its own policies. Chinese diplomats in recent weeks have repeatedly dismissed Trump’s actions as ‘madness,’ laying the blame for the deterioration in ties at Washington’s feet,” Bloomberg News observed.AsiaNational SecurityChinaDonald TrumpHong KongJoe BidenTaiwanTibetXinjiangYang Jiechi.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
549,"China’s Global Times propaganda outlet revealed Wednesday that the Chinese conglomerate Tencent will invest in the creation of “an international boy band” to promote Communist Party-approved cultural exchanges.The creation of the band will form the basis of CHUANG 2021, a talent program streamed through Tencent Video.The announcement follows a spectacularly failed attempt on the part of the Chinese government to smear the globally renowned South Korean pop supergroup BTS after a member of the group praised the U.S. military for their sacrifices during the active hostilities of the Korean War. Chinese outlets such as the Global Times condemned the praise as a direct insult to Chinese fans, given that the Chinese also fought in the Korean War, without noting the Chinese fought against the South Koreans. Numerous government reports that “netizens” — the Chinese social media users that the government does not censor — had begun boycotting the group prompted a backlash in South Korea, where BTS fans struggled to understand what Beijing was offended by and expressed frustration with the smear campaign.Following the attacks on the group, BTS broke multiple records, including becoming the first Korean musical act to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart, the first group in general to top the Artist 100, Hot 100, and Billboard 200 charts simultaneously, and the first Korean pop group to be nominated for a Grammy Award. The Chinese government campaign also failed to keep BTS singles off of Chinese radio or diminish their popularity within the country.Big Hit Entertainment, BTS’s record label, debuted on the Korean stock market in October as the country’s largest entertainment company.According to the Global Times, CHUANG 2021 will serve as an allegedly much-needed cultural exchange between China and the rest of the world, as well as providing Chinese pop music fans an option that the Communist Party would nearly directly control. Tencent is one of China’s largest companies and has close ties to the regime; under a communist system, no company is fully private. Tencent owns one of China’s most popular social media outlets, WeChat, which the regime regularly censors and uses to track inconvenient speech.“Regardless of whether Tencent is a reluctant or an eager accomplice to the Chinese government’s repressive policies, the reality is that Tencent employees can be expected to censor, monitor, and report private communications and personal data, in many cases leading to innocent people’s arrest and torture,” Freedom House warned in 2019.Tencent Video will control the search for China’s next great boy band, the Global Times noted.“The band will be picked from 90 trainees from China, Japan, Russia, and Thailand who will spend months living and training together under the guidance of a team of tutors led by Chinese actor Deng Chao,” the propaganda newspaper detailed. “According to Zhao Jing from Tencent Video, the highlights for the show will be how these trainees from different cultural backgrounds interact with each other and communicate and what the 20 or so overseas trainees will think about Chinese culture.”Not enough?Here comes another treat💥Check it out😍昨天的视频还没看够？海星鹅这不就来了！海岛男孩治愈能量大放送！这份春日笑容快递，创始人们请查收💚#CHUANG2021 #创造营2021 #CHUANG_To_GatherGO #CHUANG2021xWeTV pic.twitter.com/qGSQFYA9f6— 创造营 CHUANG2021 (@CHUANG_Official) February 3, 2021The report did not detail when the band’s career would launch, but emphasized that it was meant as a means of connecting viewers to government-approved Chinese culture in the aftermath of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, which began in Wuhan, China, in late 2019.China has proven a hospitable entertainment climate for musical talent discovery programs, in the past alarming the government. In 2017, the Chinese streaming site iQiyi debuted The Rap of China, a talent competition professing to showcase the most popular street rappers in the country. While the show is currently in its fourth season, it barely survived the first. The rappers on the program — sharing lyrics about social frustrations and concerns with authority that mirrored those of American hip-hop culture — proved to be much more popular than years of attempts by the Communist Party to produce and disseminate rap songs about the greatness of communism, with titles such as “Marx Is a Millennial,” “The Four Comprehensives Rap,” and  “The Reform Group Is Two Years Old.”The Communist Party eventually stepped in, banning “unpatriotic” rap and hip-hop culture from television and forcing some of The Rap of China‘s biggest stars to apologize for their lyrics. One of those stars, season 1 co-winner PG One, apologized for being “deeply influenced by African-American music,” which prompted accusations of racism.Since the rocky end of the first season, many of The Rap of China‘s most prominent faces have become mouthpieces for Communist Party talking points.CHUANG 2021 is likely to endure the same fate but, as a Tencent product, will likely toe the Party line from the state. Its arrival, shortly after Beijing tried to manufacture a controversy with BTS, suggests that the show’s resulting band will directly compete with the South Korean group for fans.BTS incurred the wrath of the Chinese state, government outlets claimed, because of remarks by band member RM thanking American Korean War veterans. RM made the remarks while accepting the Korea Society’s James A. Van Fleet Award, given to those with outstanding achievements in bridging the gap between America and South Korea.“The Korea Society’s 2020 Annual Gala is especially meaningful, as this year marks the 70th anniversary of the Korean War,” RM said. “We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women.”The Global Times declared netizens were “enraged” by the innocuous sentiment, claiming it reflected a “one-sided attitude” and that “many Chinese fans decide[d] to quit the band’s fan club.” Several Chinese shipping companies declared they would no longer carry and BTS branded products. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also condemned the remark.South Korea responded aggressively, condemning China and publicly praising the pro-U.S. sentiments expressed in the Korea Society award speech. The head of South Korea’s Military Manpower Administration, Mo Jong-hwa, called the speech “quite encouraging.” In a little over a month, the South Korean government voted to exempt BTS from the mandatory military service all young men must perform due to their outstanding cultural impact and elevation of South Korea’s reputation abroad, a historic first for Korean pop (K-pop).China eventually backed down and accused Seoul of overreacting to the fabricated backlash. Chinese officials also denied blocking BTS products from entering the country.Neither RM nor the group ever apologized for acknowledging the sacrifices of U.S. military veterans.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaEntertainmentNational SecurityBoy BandBTSChinacommunismK-PopSouth KoreaTencent.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
550,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sanctioned a major Chinese company last week in response to an attempt to take a controlling stake in Motor Sich, a Ukrainian aeronautics company. China lodged a protest against the move Wednesday and has demanded Ukraine “uphold the legal rights and interests” of the Chinese.The unilateral move against Chinese corporate expansionism by a state with little economic firepower to confront the world’s second-largest economy is particularly startling in light of years of attempts by Beijing to infiltrate the Ukrainian economy through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Ukraine is a BRI partner and, as recently as December, Chinese state media outlets were boasting of plans to “deepen cooperation” with Ukrainian enterprises.China established a Belt and Road Trade and Investment Promotion Center in Kiev shortly after the country joined the project in 2017. In 2019, the Asian politics outlet The Diplomat described Ukraine as being “in the front row of hidden Chinese debtor nations.”The Belt and Road Initiative is a Chinese global infrastructure plan the goal of which, Beijing says, is to recreate the Ancient Silk Road that connected China to Europe. As Ukraine sits squarely in between Beijing and western Europe, its location is prime for BRI projects. In practice, countries participating in BRI, particularly underdeveloped economies in Africa and Southeast Asia, have found themselves entangled in predatory loans that have resulted in outsized Chinese government influence in their state affairs. Countries like Kenya and Zimbabwe have also cataloged a substantial increase in incidents of racial hatred by Chinese businessmen towards locals, including the implementation of “apartheid” systems on BRI work sites.Motor Sich is a key firm for Ukraine’s strategic defense, manufacturing jet engines and other technology critical to the nation’s military. In an attempt to protect it from foreign interference, Zelensky said, the president signed a decree on Friday sanctioning four Chinese companies and three individual Chinese nationals for attempting to enforce the purchase of a controlling stake in the company. The biggest name sanctioned is Beijing Skyrizon Aviation, which, according to Reuters, now cannot move capital invested in Kyiv outside of the country for at least three years. The sanctions also significantly limited Skyrizon’s ability to purchase assets in the country.Skyrizon had already purchased what would have been a controlling stake in Motor Sich under the tenure of former President Petro Poroshenko, who lost to Zelensky, a sitcom comedian prior to becoming head of state, amid widespread accusations of corruption. Ukrainian authorities have barred Skyrizon from acting on that controlling share and frozen the purchase to investigate if the sale was done legitimately. Since then, Skyrizon has attempted to partner with other Chinese companies, making repeated attempts to come to an agreement to buy the company that Kyiv would approve.Skyrizon is owned by Chinese tycoon Wang Jing and is believed to have ties to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). China is a communist society that does not recognize true private institutions and legally requires all companies to cooperate with the state.On Sunday, Ukraine’s state security service (SBU) raided a Motor Sich shareholders’ meeting convened specifically to discuss how to push the Skyrizon purchase forward.Beijing responded with outrage to Zelensky’s move, noting that it was unilateral in nature and belying some surprise, given that China is Ukraine’s largest trade partner and that a years-long war on its eastern border with Russia has stagnated Ukraine’s economy.“China as always opposes unilateral sanctions on Chinese enterprises by foreign governments,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Monday. “In the meantime, we ask Chinese enterprises to abide by laws when doing business overseas. We hope the Ukrainian side will uphold the legal rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and investors.”Skyrizon itself issued a statement calling the sanctions a “barbaric robbery.”“On the part of Ukraine, such actions are barbaric robbery and serious violation of the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies working abroad,” Skyrizon asserted, adding that it showed “unprecedented disrespect for the principles and rules of international trade.”On Wednesday, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry confirmed that China had sent a diplomatic note to Kiev on the matter, but refused to specify its contents.“Indeed, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine received a note from the Chinese side on the situation with the Motor Sich. The note is a confidential diplomatic correspondence, therefore we cannot disclose its contents,” spokesman Oleh Nikolenko said, according to Ukraine’s Interfax. “The Ministry has informed the state bodies that are involved in this case about the document.”Shortly after imposing the sanctions, Zelensky told the U.S. media outlet Axios that he did not consider China a national security threat to Ukraine. Asked about America’s continued identification of China as such, Zelensky said, “I cannot agree with that because in Ukraine we do not feel this.”“There really is this a sort of cold war between China and the United States. We know United States business is represented in Ukraine, but at the same time, it’s true that Chinese business is also represented,” Zelensky continued. “I believe that regardless of the nation, the nationality, if people, if business, if a certain country, treats you with respect, respecting your people and borders, they can be present in your country.”On Motor Sich specifically, however, he asserted he would “never” allow any foreign company to buy it.“The president said that the question is not in China. The question is not even how the shares of Motor Sich were bought during the time of the former president, during the time of Poroshenko,” according to Interfax. “The question is that Ukraine has no right to sell the controlling stake for managing strategic defense enterprises of Ukraine to any country.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaLondon / EuropeNational SecurityChinacommunismMotor SichUkraineVolodymyr Zelensky.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
551,"China’s Global Times propaganda newspaper speculated on Sunday that the ongoing World Health Organization (W.H.O.) investigation in Wuhan may find that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic did not originate there, but spread via imported frozen food.Most scientists agree that frozen food and food packaging is not a significant mode of infection for the Chinese coronavirus.“Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that handling food or consuming food is associated with COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus],” the official page of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reads.This has not stopped Beijing, primarily through its state media outlets, from repeatedly blaming frozen food for waves of coronavirus outbreaks nationwide. The Global Times, citing Communist Party-approved “experts” and “netizens,” the social media users the Party does not censor, has now expanded the frozen food theory to posit that the Chinese coronavirus may not have originated in Wuhan. A team of W.H.O. inspectors began site visits and interviews in Wuhan this weekend after two weeks in mandated quarantine, seeking answers regarding where the virus first originated and, possibly, how to contain it.Leaked Chinese government documents revealed doctors confirmed the first case of Chinese coronavirus on November 17, 2019. No evidence exists of any confirmed cases before this.“Is it possible that the coronavirus was passed on from cold-chain products into Wuhan, or more specifically, to the Huanan seafood market, where the sale of frozen products was once so prevalent?” the Global Times asked, anyway.Contradicting Chinese government officials a year ago, the Times based its hypothesis on the claim that the Huanan market, which many of the first coronavirus cases were reportedly linked to, mostly sold frozen seafood. In reality, the seafood market had a reputation as a “wet market,” selling live exotic animals killed on-site.“Huanan seafood market was deemed to be the ‘original’ place where the virus jumped from animals to humans at the very beginning despite there was no solid evidence to demonstrate that wildlife animals were sold here or that locals have the habit of consuming bats,” the Global Times claimed. “The market was closed on January 1, 2020.”The bat mention is a reference to early theories that the virus originated in bats and that humans became infected after eating them. Scientists have subsequently turned their attention to another potential culprit: the pangolin, a type of anteater popular in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). While trafficking in pangolin is technically illegal, poaching remains a significant problem in China. No mainstream animal origin theories involve fish or other sea animals.In January 2020, Gao Fu, the director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, explicitly blamed “wildlife sold illegally” at the market for the virus.“The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market,” Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters. He said at the time that investigators had traced 31 of 33 acquired samples of the Chinese coronavirus back to wildlife at the Huanan market.Gao, who answers to the Communist Party in Beijing, later claimed that the market was a “victim” and claimed his original statement was incorrect.“At first, we assumed the seafood market might have the virus, but now the market is more like a victim. The novel coronavirus had existed long before,” he said in May.What Chinese officials later appeared to deny – that the Huanan market sold wild animals for food – was readily evident to visitors in February 2020.“The now-shuttered Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market advertised dozens of species such as giant salamanders, baby crocodiles and raccoon dogs that were often referred to as wildlife, even when they were farmed,” the Associated Press noted in a February report that repeated the Chinese government’s claim that 31 of 33 collected coronavirus samples were traced back to “wildlife booths.”Chinese government “experts” told the Global Times that the cases were linked to “areas selling frozen food,” without providing evidence or explaining the contradiction with reports from non-government sources. The newspaper also called speculation that foreign frozen food had triggered outbreaks in other major cities nationwide a “fact,” despite the lack of evidence.“The possibility that the coronavirus was passed on from contaminated cold-chain products into Wuhan cannot be ruled out,” the Times insisted.
Scientists in the free world largely disagree that frozen food is a matter of concern in spreading the virus.“It’s theoretically plausible, but the risk is much lower than the other more established routes of transmission for this virus,” Siddharth Sridhar, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), told Time magazine in November, calling screenings of imported food for coronavirus “looking for a needle in a haystack.”“Currently there is no evidence of food, food containers, or food packaging being associated with transmission of COVID-19,” the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a statement to Time.“The risk of getting sick with COVID-19 from eating or handling food (including frozen food and produce) and food packages is considered very low,” the U.S. CDC concurs on its website.The W.H.O. investigative team reportedly visited the Huanan market on Sunday but spent half of its day at another market, the Baishazhou, which has no known links to the pandemic.“We went to two markets today. The Baishazhou this morning and Huanan this afternoon. We had some good discussions with market regulators, vendors, suppliers, and community leaders,” the head of the team, Peter Ben Embarek, told the Global Times. Ben Embarek did not elaborate on the reasoning behind visiting the Baishazhou market.Even taking into consideration early reports linking the virus to the wildlife trade at the Huanan market, the chances of public health officials finding any useful evidence there is slim given that Communist Party officials openly admitted to destroying early samples of the virus and “disinfecting” the area, leaving little to be found. Interviews with workers at the market and other locals are also unlikely to yield helpful intelligence, as families of early coronavirus victims denounced the local Wuhan Communist Party last week for silencing them and keeping them from being able to speak to the W.H.O. team.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityScienceChinacommunismcoronavirusfrozen foodGlobal Timespangolinwet marketsWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
552,"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sent an additional 100 “cadres” to work in its top Hong Kong office over the past year to ensure the city was ruled by Chinese “patriots,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Friday.“One mainland [China] source said about 200 new cadres had been transferred to the central government’s liaison office in the past year, partly to replace others in jobs on rotation,” according to the Hong Kong-based newspaper, which cited unnamed sources with knowledge on the matter.“The net increase was about 100,” the source said. “Some of the rotations planned for last year were delayed because of the [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic and the circumstances in Hong Kong, so there have been more newcomers recently.”The Hong Kong liaison office needed extra staff because the CCP had recently assigned the outpost more responsibilities, the source added. The cadres’ new tasks serve an overall duty of ensuring that Hong Kong is “ruled by patriots.” Specific duties include building bridges with Hong Kong youth who expressed displeasure towards Beijing during the city’s pro-democracy protest movement over the past year and a half, identifying “long-term governance challenges” for the city, and containing the spread of Chinese coronavirus within the community.The new cadres “all attended briefings, including on disciplinary issues, in Shenzhen before they arrived in Hong Kong,” a second source close to the Hong Kong liaison office told the SCMP. Shenzhen is a city located in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong that borders Hong Kong.“The disciplinary reminder is important because the liaison office now promotes a down-to-earth working style and following [Communist Party discipline] is a top priority,” the second source said.The CCP replaced the head of the Hong Kong liaison office in January 2020 with Luo Huining, a Chinese political official known for enforcing Communist Party discipline in previous posts. The party likewise appointed Chinese politician Xia Baolong as the new head of the cabinet-level Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) in Beijing early last year.“Early this week, Shi Kehui, the former anti-corruption chief of Guangdong province, was transferred to Beijing to take a similar role at the HKMAO,” the SCMP reported on Friday.“Among the new faces at the liaison office in Hong Kong is social media strategist Zheng Lin, who was appointed deputy director of its publicity, culture and sports department,” the newspaper noted. Zheng formerly worked for China Youth Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Youth League of China. CCP officials transferred her from that position to the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the top CCP agency in charge of law enforcement, before placing her at their Hong Kong outpost.Beijing imposed an illegal national security law on Hong Kong in May 2020, stripping the city of its traditional semi-autonomy. The legislation was part of the CCP’s efforts to quash a powerful pro-democracy protest movement that had rocked the city since the previous summer. The law’s passing precipitated a crackdown on the leaders of the city’s protest movement by Hong Kong security forces.Under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy, Beijing does not have the power to pass laws to be enforced in Hong Kong.AsiaNational SecurityChinaHong Kong.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
553,"Malaysian retail investors rallied on social media to drive up stocks of Malaysian rubber glove manufacturers on Friday, in a move modeled on the GameStop trading surge witnessed in the U.S. this week.Shares of the U.S. video game store GameStop skyrocketed from less than $20 to a peak of $492 this week after millions of amateur investors organized around the online forum Reddit to collectively send prices of the shares soaring, punishing major investors who were short-selling the store’s shares, or betting on the stock’s fall.Short-selling occurs when an investor borrows a stock, sells it on the open market, and then buys it back to return it to a lender at a lower price, earning a profit on the difference. Short-sellers are betting that the price of the stock they sell will decrease. If a stock’s price increases unexpectedly, however, the investor is then forced to buy back the shares at a higher price, meaning a loss.Inspired by the strategic popular action behind the GameStop share surge this week, which centered around a Reddit forum called “r/wallstreetbets,” amateur Malaysian investors on Thursday set up their own Reddit group, naming it “BursaBets” after Malaysia’s stock exchange.A moderator of the BursaBets subreddit known as “Mod Revenant” told news site Coconuts Kuala Lumpur on Friday that he and his eight fellow moderators believe that the current value of glove industry shares in Malaysia, preyed upon by the same kind of short-selling that bet against GameStop, are too low.“In my perspective, there is no justifying the currently low prices of our glove shares,” the moderator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. “If you showed this stock to anyone, they’ll understand how under-valued it is.”Mod Revenant added that he thinks Malaysia’s stock market is “constantly being manipulated by larger financial entities.”BursaBets members such as “Glovefan1205” are using the thread to organize “buying and holding shares from industry players such as Malaysia’s largest glove manufacturer, Top Glove,” according to Coconuts Kuala Lumpur.“A day after Bursabets was formed and drew 6,400 members, shares of local glove-making companies rose 3 percent to 9 percent, with Top Glove leading the rise. After closing at RM6.21 (US$1.53) yesterday, Top Glove shares opened at RM7.05 [$1.74] this morning on the Bursa Malaysia stock market,” the news site reported on January 29.Malaysia’s securities regulator and stock exchange, Bursa Malaysia, released a joint statement on Friday saying they were “closely monitoring” domestic trading after witnessing a recent rally in some U.S. stocks.“Where warranted, the SC (Securities Commission) and Bursa Malaysia will take the necessary measures to curb disruptive trading practices and market abuse,” their statement read.“Investors should be wary of discussions in social media chatrooms that may trigger securities breaches such as the provisions on investment advice or stock recommendations without a license,” the statement cautioned.“Any person found guilty may be liable to a penalty of up to 10 million ringgit [about $2.5 million] or imprisonment not exceeding ten years or both,” Malaysia’s securities regulator warned.AsiaEconomyNational SecurityGameStopInvestorsMalaysiaRedditrubber glovesshort sellingstock market.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
554,"India’s foreign ministry on Wednesday denounced “vested interest groups” for attempting to impose their agenda on farmers’ protests in New Delhi after Western celebrities commented on the demonstrations via social media this week.“It is unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement released February 3.“Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken. The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” the Indian foreign ministry added.“Among those who had expressed solidarity with the farmers on Twitter were pop star Rihanna, environmental activist Greta Thunberg and also U.S. Vice-President Kamala Harris’ lawyer niece Meena Harris,” the Times of India reported on Wednesday.Tens of thousands of farmers have been camped out on the outskirts of India’s national capital, New Delhi, since November to protest three agricultural reforms passed by the Indian Congress in September. The farmers, mainly from the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab, say the reforms undermine their traditional farm price and labor protections.“The farmers, who form a powerful political constituency, fear the laws passed in September could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers,” India’s NDTV news site reported in December. “Farm groups say the government is trying to end a decades-old policy of providing them with an assured minimum price for producing staples, such as wheat and rice.”India’s foreign ministry defended the recent agricultural reforms in its February 3 statement.“[T]he Indian Parliament, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector. These reforms, it said, gave expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers, apart from paving the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming,” the ministry noted, adding that “[a] very small section of farmers in parts of India have some reservations about these reforms.”“Respecting the sentiments of the protestors, the government of India has initiated a series of talks with their representatives,” the statement said. Union Ministers, who wield executive authority in India, “have been part of the negotiations, and eleven rounds of talks have already been held. The government has even offered to keep the laws on hold.”The foreign ministry referred to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on January 30 that his offer to keep the three agricultural laws in abeyance for 18 months “still stands.” The prime minister added that his government was “committed to reaching a solution through dialogue.” Modi in his January 30 speech also denounced the violence that erupted during farmers’ protests in New Delhi on January 26, saying the “law will take its own course.”January 26 is the date of India’s Republic Day, which commemorates the nation adopting its constitution in 1950. Protesting farmers deviated from pre-approved marching routes on the holiday last month, breaking through police-laid barriers to enter central New Delhi on “tractors, motorbikes, horses, and even cranes.” Thousands of farmers easily overtook hundreds of outnumbered policemen in the capital to eventually storm Delhi’s historic Red Fort. At least one person died in the ensuing violence, which also injured at least 83 police officers. Police in New Delhi have since served a dozen notices to leaders of the farmers’ protests as part of an investigation into the January 26 riots.AsiaEntertainmentNational SecurityDelhiFarmersIndiaNarendra ModiNew Delhiprotests.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
555,"India’s Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed a Mumbai High Court order that acquitted a man accused of molestation and ruled that groping a minor’s breast without “skin-to-skin contact” does not constitute sexual assault.“A bench of Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde and Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian stayed the high court order after Attorney General K.K. Venugopal mentioned the matter,” Indian news site The Wire reported on January 27.The Nagpur bench of the Mumbai High Court ruled on January 24 that “there must be a ‘skin-to-skin contact’ with sexual intent, and mere groping is not sufficient [sic]” to constitute sexual assault under India’s Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POSCO) Act. The ruling was made as the Nagpur bench heard an appeal against the conviction of a 39-year-old man “in a case where the accused had allegedly taken a minor girl to his house under the garb of offering her a guava [fruit] and pressed her breasts and partially stripped her,” according to The Wire.“The act of pressing of breast [sic] of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of ‘sexual assault’ [sic],” the single-judge bench of Justice Pushpa Ganediwala held.Justice Ganediwala acquitted the accused under the POCSO Act, “while upholding his conviction under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code. Considering that the man was out on bail, the court forfeited his bail bond, and issued a non-bailable warrant against him,” Indian news site Scroll.in reported.Prior to his acquittal, a trial court in Nagpur on January 19 had sentenced the accused to “three years’ imprisonment under section 8 of the POSCO Act and under section 354 [of the Indian Penal Code] IPC (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage a woman’s modesty),” according to the Times of India.“Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of Nagpur bench had said ‘stricter proof and serious allegations are required given the stringent punishment of three to five years’ imprisonment that ‘sexual assault’ under the POSCO Act entails,” the Times reported of the man’s January 24 acquittal.Mumbai’s High Court on Wednesday “convicted the man for a ‘minor offense’ and sentenced him to one year in jail overruling [the] trial court’s [sentence of] three years’ imprisonment,” according to the newspaper.

556,"Russian authorities have detained various family members and allies of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on charges of violating coronavirus restrictions through their participation in mass protests calling for his release from jail, the head of Navalny’s anti-corruption group Ivan Zhdanov said Thursday.“Navalny’s brother Oleg and Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) lawyer Lyubov Sobol, as well as Navalny’s ophthalmologist and head of the independent Doctors’ Alliance union Anastasia Vasilyeva, have been detained for 48 hours,” Zhdanov revealed on Twitter according to the Moscow Times.Police conducted raids and detentions across 30 Moscow locations this week as part of a crackdown on participants of pro-Navalny protests in Moscow and across Russia on January 23. Police have detained nearly 4,000 people nationwide for their participation in the mass gatherings. Ahead of the planned protests, Russian authorities warned citizens that the rallies were unauthorized by state authorities and thus participants risked official consequences, such as detention and fines, should they participate.Navalny supporters are planning a second round of unauthorized protests on January 31, expecting to use Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters in Moscow as a key protest site.A woman from Russia’s northern Arkhangelsk region claimed this week she was questioned by local police after she staged an anti-government protest with snowmen in her front yard on January 23. Unable to attend mass rallies demanding Navalny’s release from jail on January 23, Yelena Kalinina told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) that she decided to create her own protest scene in front of her home in the Arkhangelsk village of Zachachye.“She made four snowmen to which she stuck pieces of cardboard with slogans reading ‘Down With The Tsar!’ and ‘This Is Our Country!’” according to the U.S.-funded broadcaster.“A mass picket in Zachachye,” Kalinina wrote on social media, attaching images of her snowman rally that soon garnered several comments and “likes.”“Police came to Kalinina’s home early the following day [January 24]. They removed the cardboard signs and whisked her off to a nearby village for questioning,” RFE/RL revealed.“They told me this was a decision from above, from [the regional capital] Arkhangelsk,” she told RFE/RL’s Russian Service. Kalinina said she was later released without charge.“People ask me: Do you support Navalny?” she wrote in a social media post on January 17. “I answer: I’m against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin!”Putin’s most prominent critic, Alexei Navalny, was detained on January 17 upon returning to his native Russia from Germany. A court in Moscow ruled the next day that Navalny would remain in police custody until February 15 while officials prepare a new trial to determine whether he committed a parole violation by failing to report to Russian authorities in person while in Germany.Navalny had been in Germany convalescing after falling seriously ill on a Russian domestic flight on August 20. The 44-year-old was airlifted from Russia to Germany for medical treatment on August 22, where he remained until this month. German doctors familiar with Navalny’s case say evidence suggests that he ingested the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.

557,"New Zealand’s left-wing Labour government has taken key ally Australia to task over its dealings with China, warning Canberra on Thursday it should “show respect” to Beijing.Boasting of Wellington’s recent success in trade talks with China, NZ Trade Minister Damien O’Connor urged Australia to change its tune and follow New Zealand’s diplomatic lead, AFP reports.“I can’t speak for Australia and the way it runs its diplomatic relationships, but clearly if they were to follow us and show respect, I guess a little more diplomacy from time to time and be cautious with wording, then they too could hopefully be in a similar situation,” he said.New Zealand’s policy of appeasement towards China has been reflected in its previous refusal to sign joint statements from Five Eyes partners criticising China’s crackdown on the Hong Kong democracy movement, including the recent arrests of activists in the city.New Zealand officials have also been quiet about China’s growing influence in the Pacific, unlike their U.S. and Australian counterparts who have not been silent in challenging Beijing’s increasing activity in the region, as Breitbart News reported.In return for Canberra’s challenges, China has imposed punitive levies on more than a dozen Australian imports, including wine and barley, as relations sour.China Says Australia Becoming ‘Poor White Trash of Asia’ by Resisting Beijing https://t.co/l1rl0ZXqtM— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 1, 2020Other irritants for Beijing include Australia’s call for an inquiry into the origins of coronavirus and a ban on Chinese tech giant Huawei’s participation in the nation’s 5G network.China’s state-run Global Times newspaper on Wednesday agreed with New Zealand, saying the South Pacific neighbors are “fire and ice” in their dealings with Beijing, accusing Canberra of having “a jingoistic Cold War mentality” while New Zealand was “relatively open toward the rise of China.”The Chinese Communist Party has also found a way to tear into the strong Five Eyes alliance, with both New Zealand and Canada breaking ranks, as reported locally by Sky News Australia:﻿New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who once worked in UK Prime Minister Tony Blair’s Cabinet Office as a policy adviser,  is no stranger to diplomatic dealings with Beijing.In early 2008, Ardern was elected president of the International Union of Socialist Youth, a role which saw her spend time in several countries, including China.AFP contributed to this storyAsiaLondon / EuropePoliticsAustraliaCanberraChinadiplomacyJacinda ArdernNew ZealandTony Blair.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
558,"China’s state-run Global Times published multiple condemnations this week of a largely favorable article in Time magazine highlighting the growing meat substitute industry in the country, accusing those urging vegan diets in China of having a “sense of superiority” over Han Chinese people.China is the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases fueling climate change. A 2018 scientific study described reducing the consumption of meat products as the “single biggest way” to reduce the harmful effects of pollution on the world environment. China consumes so much meat that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) listed an African swine fever epidemic in the country in 2019 as the “primary” reason for a global decline in meat consumption that year.Environmental and animal rights groups, as well as public health experts, have also increasingly criticized the Chinese phenomenon of “wet markets” in the era of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Wet markets are open-air locations where consumers have access to live animals killed on sight to be purchased for food. Many markets feature exotic animals and face minimal oversight, prompting accusations of being hubs of disease. The Chinese government initially blamed a wet market in central Wuhan city for the initial spread of the Chinese coronavirus, though it has since pivoted to claiming that the U.S. military secretly began infecting people with it in Maryland in 2019, citing no evidence.China reopened its wet markets in April with the approval of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.).The Global Times urged those concerned about growing meat consumption in China — naming former President Barack Obama specifically — to instead express more concern with nations like Argentina and New Zealand, where beef consumption is high compared to other states but carbon emissions are relatively negligible.“In recent years, the West has constantly raised concerns over the impact of Chinese eating meat on the environment,” the Global Times observed this weekend, quoting the CEO of the meat substitute company Impossible Foods, Pat Brown, stating, “every time someone in China eats a piece of meat, a little puff of smoke goes up in the Amazon.”The Times also took issue with a remark Obama made in an interview in 2010: “If over a billion Chinese citizens have the same living patterns as Australians and Americans do right now, then all of us are in for a very miserable time. The planet just can’t sustain it.”The newspaper accused Obama and those concerned about meat consumption in China of bigotry.“In the eyes of some Western elites, Westerners can have the privilege to eat meat while Chinese should just eat grass,” the outraged newspaper accused. “They are reluctant to see Chinese are living an increasingly abundant life, and that the living standards of the Chinese are getting closer to the Westerners.”The Global Times claimed that a declining “sense of superiority” was fueling environmental concerns, particularly towards “their political system … when they see Chinese, whose political path and values sharply differ from them, can also enjoy a better life.”“Their intent of groundless blame and ‘moral kidnapping’ in the name of protecting environment [sic] or assuming international responsibility is simply to smear China’s international image and contain its further development,” the government publication concluded.In a separate article also published this weekend, the Times cited Chinese “netizens” — the social media users the Communist Party allows to share their opinions online due to their favorable takes on the regime — calling Time and the West generally “hypocritical” for expressing any concern about meat consumption in China.“Chinese observers booed the article,” the Global Times claimed, “saying the biased view was ridiculous and highlighted a double standard. Western media always hype China’s annual meat consumption but ignore the large population of China.”The “netizens” allegedly insisted that only per capita meat consumption figures, and not the actual amount of meat eaten in each country, was a valid metric. The article nonetheless noted that China consumes half the world’s port and 28 percent of the world’s meat while insisting these data were unfair to China.The article also decried that America is “historically” the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, despite the fact that this is no longer the case, and claimed China “has done a good job on reducing carbon emissions,” without significant elaboration.A pro-government “expert” appeared in the article, again raising the specter of anti-Chinese bigotry.“Are Chinese people inherently inferior to enjoy the standard of living as those in Western developed countries?” the “expert” asked.The aggressive response to the Time article disregarded that the American magazine favorably painted China as a leader in plant-based eating, going so far as to speculate that its authoritarian government, believed to run the world’s largest concentration camps, is a net benefit to the world environment.“Crucially, state action could have real consequences — China’s authoritarian system enables it to dictate commercial priorities and consumer behavior across its 1.4 billion population,” the article claimed, praising China for being “on the cusp of a plant-based-protein revolution” and for maintaining a traditional cuisine that prioritizes plant-based food.In contrast, Time described Americans as “indoctrinated by a powerful meat lobby and a founding myth built around cowboys and beef ranches.”People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a U.S.-based animal rights organization that has both condemned the continued existence of wet markets and highlighted Asian cuisine in its slate of vegan recipes, emphasized in a statement to Breitbart News that it, as the preeminent pro-animal organization in the West, is seeking not just the promotion of plant-based diets in China.“PETA wants the world to go vegan, and the U.S. and Europe could learn a thing or two from China, where foods like mock duck and soy-based pork originated and vegan brands like OmniPork, Starfield, Z-Rou, and Beyond Meat are booming,” Jason Baker, the vice president of PETA Asia, said in a statement. “We believe China can continue to lead by encouraging its citizens to abandon filthy pig factories and ‘wet markets.'”China’s growing economy — setting a record for its trade surplus in 2020 — allows for both the reality that plant-based protein companies are increasingly popular and meat consumption is booming. Time‘s praise for plant-based eating in China follows the Global Times‘ boasting late last year that “China’s appetite for meat is showing no sign of slowing down.”“The country is the world’s largest consumer of meat by some margin, with citizens expected to eat 40.3 million metric tons of pork in 2020, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),” the Times noted in November, highlighting the exact data it chided Time for mentioning this week. Rather than identifying the low level of per-capita meat consumption compared to Western countries as an environmentalist victory, the Global Times said in November that the fact shows “huge potential for future growth” in meat consumption.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaEnvironmentNational SecurityAnimal RightsChinacommunismGlobal TimesMeatPETATime MagazineVeganismwet markets.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
559,"A University of Hong Kong survey published Thursday revealed a nearly 20-percent drop in interest among Hong Kong residents in receiving any vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus between November and January, and that less than one-third of those living in the city would take a vaccine China developed.The survey revealed rapidly growing distrust in the city of both Hong Kong officials and their masters in Beijing, a distrust that had initially led to protests in 2019 against a proposed law to allow extraditions into China and culminated in China illegally imposing its laws on the nominally autonomous city.Under the policy known as “One Country, Two Systems,” the government of Hong Kong cannot legally declare independence from China, and the Chinese Communist Party cannot impose laws passed in Beijing onto Hong Kong, allowing the city to persist as a bastion of free speech and enterprise following the United Kingdom’s surrender of the territory to China in 1997. Last year, in response to the 2019 protests, Beijing passed a “national security” law that allowed the Communist Party to prosecute — and imprison for a minimum of ten years — individuals found guilty of four “crimes”: terrorism, promoting foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs, secession, and “subversion of state power.” While blatantly violating “One Country, Two Systems,” Hong Kong police have enforced the law against some of the city’s most prominent pro-democracy activists.While the coronavirus pandemic does not have a direct association with the pro-democracy movement, skepticism regarding anything involving China appears to persist in Hong Kong outside of the political.According to Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), the survey found only 46 percent of Hong Kong residents said they would be willing to take a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus. In November, that number was over half of respondents, 63 percent.Asked specifically if they would be willing to receive several of the available vaccines and vaccine candidates around the world, “CoronaVac,” an experimental vaccine candidate by the Chinese firm Sinovac, received the lowest support of any of the options. Only about 30 percent of people in Hong Kong would trust the Sinovac option.In contrast, 56 percent of respondents said they were open to taking the vaccine developed by the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer. While tensions between Hong Kong and China may be partially fueling distrust of CoronaVac, the product has also fared significantly worse than the Pfizer vaccine in clinical studies.The Sao Paulo-based Butantan Institute, which has been conducting Sinovac’s human trials, initially announced it had found CoronaVac was about 78 percent effective, significantly lower than the 95-percent success rate of the Pfizer option. Sinovac then corrected itself and said that its vaccine was actually closer to 50 percent effective.“When data from all volunteers is considered, including those who contracted ‘very mild’ cases of Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] and required no medical assistance, the total efficacy rate falls to 50.38 percent,” the Butantan Institute clarified in mid-January.The results raised the question globally of whether the Sinovac option was worth taking at all, especially given the limited information on adverse reactions.The Global Times, a Chinese state propaganda outlet, rapidly declared CoronaVac “good enough.”“Experts say the result is good enough considering almost all participants in Brazil are high-risk medical workers, and the 77.96 efficacy for mild-case protection means the vaccine can reduce 78 percent of people from needing hospitalization,” the newspaper argued.Many in Hong Kong appear unconvinced, particularly younger residents, Thursday’s survey results indicated.“The survey also found that younger people and those with higher education and income levels are less receptive to Covid vaccines,” RTHK noted, highlighting demographics that are also likelier to be sympathetic to the pro-democracy movement in the city.The head of the University of Hong Kong’s medical school, Gabriel Leung, linked the survey results to the anti-communist sentiments in Hong Kong in remarks to RTHK.“When you’ve got that kind of chasm in society … that kind of deep mistrust of the authorities following the social unrest, and you have Covid [Chinese coronavirus], we should have been doing much worse than we have done,” Leung said, predicting that rates of trust in vaccines will rise. “So I think that Hong Kong people should really, looking back over the last year, give ourselves a pat on the back. Well done.”Hong Kong’s government, now fully controlled by China, initially ordered 7.5 million doses of CoronaVac this month and expected them to arrive soon, the Hindustan Times noted. Hong Kong’s population is about 7.5 million people; the vaccine candidate requires two doses. The doses have yet to arrive at press time. At the time, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the government had also purchased doses of the Pfizer vaccine and a vaccine candidate by the University of Oxford and European firm Astra-Zeneca.No widespread vaccination has begun in Hong Kong and the government is facing an accelerating rate of coronavirus cases, resulting in the largest lockdowns in the city since the pandemic began last year. As of Thursday, Hong Kong has documented over 10,000 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 175 deaths. Since last week, however, the government has begun taking aggressive “ambush” lockdown measures, banning residents from leaving their homes in neighborhoods affected by the outbreaks without warning them of any impending limitations to their freedom. On Thursday, RTHK reported that a residential building complex with high rates of positive coronavirus cases awoke in the morning to the reality that they were the target of an “ambush-style” lockdown. Government officials suggested the lockdown would ease by 7 a.m. local time Friday, but opponents argued that not giving residents the chance to stock up on food and other necessities beforehand was dangerous and a violation of their rights.“If you lock down there overnight, there is nobody to handle the rubbish that has been accumulated for a day. I think the government has to be more considerate on some elderly and children, to let them go through the process in a more comfortable way,” local district representative Lee Yue-shun told RTHK.AsiaNational SecurityScienceChinacommunismCoronavaccoronavirusHong KongPfizerSinovac.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
560,"A spokesman for the Pentagon said Thursday that the Taliban was jeopardizing the peace process with the United States by failing to live up to its promise to cut ties with terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and cease its attacks on Afghan forces.American officials began a new round of talks with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar, in September that resulted in an agreement Trump administration officials hoped would help result in a final exit of American troops from Afghanistan. The top concerns of American negotiators were to convince the Taliban to stop cooperating with terrorist groups that seek to kill Americans, like al-Qaeda, and to encourage Taliban officials to use political means, and not attacking U.S. troops, to amass political power.The Taliban demanded an end to the Afghan government — the Taliban considers itself the only legitimate government of Afghanistan — and the imposition of a Sunni jihadist caliphate in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is already an Islamic republic, governed in part by sharia, or Islamic law.While American officials did not agree to that demand, the Taliban did succeed in getting the Afghan government to agree to free hundreds of Taliban jihadis from prison, moving the talks forward. Afghanistan documented a dramatic decline in civilian casualties in 2020, according to the United Nations, in part fueled by diminished Taliban attacks on Americans and civilians, and increased attacks on Afghan security forces.American forces were scheduled to depart Afghanistan completely by May 2021 in the event that the Taliban followed through on its promises.The Pentagon’s warning that the Taliban have, in addition to continuing to attack Afghan forces, also maintained ties to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda could fray the already delicate diplomatic situation.“We are still involved in trying to get a negotiated settlement. The Taliban have not met their commitments,” John Kirby, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said Thursday, according to Afghanistan’s Khaama News. “Without them meeting their commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan national security forces, and by dint of that the Afghan people, it’s very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.”Kirby added that, without a clear indication that the Taliban were enacting their commitments in the deal in good faith, the Pentagon could not guarantee a full American troop withdrawal by May.“What I’m saying is that any decision of force levels in Afghanistan is going to be driven by our security requirements, there are security commitments there, and driven by conditions,” he emphasized. “No decision has been made on future force posture.”The U.S. Treasury Department, which engages in activities to limit terrorist financing, warned similarly in its January report that it had evidence indicating that al-Qaeda was increasing its financial foothold in Afghanistan, thanks in part to help from the Taliban.Al-Qaeda, the Treasury report said, was enriching itself in the country “through its network of mentors and advisers who are embedded with the Taliban, providing advice, guidance, and financial support.” The report explicitly accused the Taliban of offering al-Qaeda “protection” in direct contradiction to peace deal commitments.“As of May 2020, the Taliban and al-Qaeda maintained a strong relationship and continued to meet regularly,” the report said.Taliban spokesmen have complained since at least October that the American government was allegedly not holding up its end of the deal because of continued airstrikes on terrorist targets.“In recent days, the United States forces conducted day-and-night airstrikes in Nahri Saraj, Khoshkawa, Babaji of Helmand province, including areas in Gereshk, Sangin, Nawa, and Nad Ali districts,” Taliban spokesman Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi said at the time. “Also [airstrikes] in Farah and other provinces, which is a clear violation of the Doha agreement.”Similarly, Taliban representatives protested Friday that they had fulfilled their end of the deal but that, in allowing the legitimate government of Afghanistan to continue to exist, Washington was harming its relations with the jihadist organization.“Ashraf Ghani’s administration is the only hurdle for peace,” Taliban negotiator Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai said on Friday from Moscow, referring to the president of Afghanistan. “One of their insincerity [sic] is that their (Afghan Republic’s negotiating) team has not been given full authority for talks.”Stanekzai was in Moscow, he said, to pressure Russia and other neighboring countries to help convince the administration of President Joe Biden to withdraw from Afghanistan.“These countries are very close to us, they are our neighbors, they are involved in Afghan matters. That’s why we’re talking to them, we share their concern and we seek their support for the peace process in Afghanistan,” Stanekzai responded when asked about his tour.“We hope that Americans should go according to this peace treaty which was signed in Doha. It’s a good chance for Americans … it is in their favor,” he argued.Voice of America quoted Stanekzai as noting that the Taliban were giving the American troops an unprecedented chance in the history of the ancient country and vehemently denying reports alleging that the Russian government had offered the Taliban bounties for killing Americans.“We do not need anyone to give us reward for the killing of Americans. Americans are the invaders and we are [have been] killing them since 2001,” he asserted. “If they remain in Afghanistan after this [the agreed deadline] we will also kill them even if somebody reward us or do not reward us. We take our reward from God. We fight the invaders without a reward, without any bounty.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityAfghanistanal-QaedaDonald TrumpjihadPentagonRussiaTaliban.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
561,"The communist government of North Korea has failed to complete the Pyongyang General Hospital — a flagship project announced by dictator Kim Jong-un last year — because it ran out of building materials, Radio Free Asia (RFA) revealed Tuesday.Kim announced the construction of a state-of-the-art healthcare facility in the capital in March 2020, at the height of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in that part of the world, in a speech titled, “Let Us Build the Pyongyang General Hospital in an Excellent Way, Greeting the 75th Founding Anniversary of the Workers’ Party of Korea.” At the time, North Korean authorities claimed they had not identified a single case of Chinese coronavirus nationwide, despite the nation sharing borders with China, Russia, and South Korea, all of which have endured significant outbreaks. North Korean authorities insisted to this day that they have not seen a single case of coronavirus within their borders.The call for rapidly constructing a hospital indicated to outsiders, however, that North Korea was indeed undergoing a crisis necessitating significant investments in health care.RFA reported Tuesday, citing sources on the ground, that China enforcing sanctions against North Korea and sealing the mutual border in response to the coronavirus pandemic has made it extremely difficult for the country to procure the materials to complete the interior of the building and acquire the medical supplies to make it functional.“Though exterior work on the Pyongyang General Hospital is complete, the project was supposed to have been ready by the Oct. 10 75th anniversary of the 1945 founding of the ruling Korean Workers’ Party,” RFA reported, “but builders have not been able to install elevators or finishing hospital’s interiors without building materials and medical equipment from China.”RFA claimed that no work had been done on the site in months.The organization’s anonymous source detailed, “the interior work has not been started at all. Electric wiring, lighting, marble, other interior materials and medical equipment should have been imported from China, but they have not been brought in due to the coronavirus.”Pyongyang also reportedly has no way of purchasing elevators, key for moving patients around.The failure to complete the Pyongyang General Hospital, in addition to potentially exacerbating a health crisis that North Korea vehemently denies is happening, is particularly embarrassing for Kim Jong-un in light of the fact that his order to build it was in part an admission that North Korea had failed to provide proper services to its citizens. In announcing the project in March, Kim described himself and his ruling Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) as “miserably self-critical” due to the fact that “there is no perfect and modern medical service establishment even in the capital city.”“Comrades — The Pyongyang General Hospital … will turn into a structure that demonstrates, as they are, the spirit of our country advancing vigorously towards the better future,” Kim said, “by frustrating cheerfully the mean sanctions and blockade of the hostile forces and the unchangeable situation of our revolution.”By July, North Korean state media revealed some signs that the project was not progressing as rapidly as Kim had hoped. The state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that Kim visited the construction site that month and left dejected, calling Party bureaucrats “careless” and ordering their immediate replacement with more competent officials.“After hearing a detailed report on the overall situation of the construction from the construction coordination commission on the spot, he pointed out serious problems in economic organization for the construction,” KCNA said of Kim. “He said that the construction coordination commission is organizing economy in a careless manner with no budget for the construction properly set up, yet.”Kim was reportedly particularly incensed by reports that communist officials were pressuring local civilians to donate money and resources to the construction of the hospital because they had mismanaged the funds they were given and needed more. The report emphasized that Kim’s ire was at the bureaucrats, not the construction workers at the site, which aligns with current reports that the delay in completing the hospital is one of materials resources, not insufficient manpower.Prior to its specific report on the Pyongyang General Hospital, RFA revealed last week that North Korea had essentially run out of construction material for all of its projects, leading diplomats to attempt to convince China to allow trade, including illicit trade, to restart across the Yalu River border.“They need to import raw materials, so they want to slowly restore the Sino-Korean trade system, which was suspended due to the coronavirus,” an unnamed source in China told the outlet, saying that usual North Korean customers had begun calling with increased desperation and hoping for access to materials.“They said the framing of several apartment buildings has already been completed, but they cannot finish the interiors because they need things like doors, window frames, bathtubs and toilets,” the source said, echoing the report on the Pyongyang General Hospital. “They said they urgently need these finishing materials for construction.”Adding to North Korea’s woes, much of its economic plan for 2020, developed the year before, revolved around attracting Chinese tourism by building resorts and other facilities to attract travelers. In the aftermath of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, tourism around the world has cratered as an industry.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacommunismcoronavirushospitalKim Jong-unNorth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
562,"A new strain of African swine fever recently identified on Chinese pig farms was likely caused by “illicit vaccines,” industry experts said this week.In the absence of an approved vaccine for African swine fever, “many Chinese farmers struggling to protect their pigs have resorted to unapproved products,” Reuters revealed on Tuesday, citing industry insiders and experts who “fear illicit vaccines have created accidental infections, which are now spreading.”Two new strains of African swine fever have infected over 1,000 sows across several farms owned by China’s fourth-largest pork producer, New Hope Liuhe, in recent weeks. Pigs being fattened for New Hope by contract farmers have also been infected by the new virus strains, New Hope chief science officer Yan Zhichun told Reuters on Tuesday.“I don’t know where they come from, but we find some mild field infections caused by some sort of gene-deleted viruses,”  Yan said.A Beijing-based veterinarian named Wayne Johnson said he diagnosed a chronic, and less lethal, form of African swine fever in pigs at Chinese farms in 2020. The virus strain diagnosed by Johnson “lacked certain genetic components, known as the MGF360 genes,” according to Reuters. The two new African swine fever variants recently detected at New Hope are “missing both the MGF360 genes and the CD2v genes,” according to Yan.“Research has shown that deleting some MGF360 genes from African swine fever creates immunity, but the modified virus was not developed into a vaccine because it tended to later mutate back to a harmful state,” Reuters noted.“You can sequence these things, these double deletions, and if it’s exactly the same as described in the lab, it’s too much of a coincidence, because you would never get that exact deletion,” Lucilla Steinaa, principal scientist at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, told the news agency.While no cure or approved vaccine for African swine fever exists, China said in August that it was close to approving the first vaccine candidate for the virus.China is the world’s largest producer of pork. The country’s pork industry was devastated by previous strains of African swine fever that swept Chinese pig farms in 2018 and 2019. China is still recovering from the deficit caused by the outbreaks, which wiped out 40 percent of the country’s pig population. The Chinese government is currently working to both rebuild China’s pork supply and protect it from future outbreaks.The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs launched a crackdown on the production and use of illegal or fake African swine fever vaccines in late August, advising the public that provincial authorities would soon carry out “inspections at veterinary laboratories, drug producers and pig farmers for any evidence they could have developed or used an illegal vaccine.”Authorities will “investigate veterinary laboratories used for research or commercial purposes and check any unlabelled vaccines and disease materials or reagents along with the records of experiments,” the agriculture ministry said at the time.The Chinese state-backed newspaper Legal Daily reported last May that police in China’s southwestern city of Chongqing had “arrested seven people found to be producing a fake African swine fever vaccine.”AsiaHealthNational SecurityAfrican Swine FeverChinapigsPorkswinevaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
563,"Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide apologized on Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling party admitted to visiting Tokyo bars late at night during the capital’s coronavirus state of emergency, which discourages unnecessary outings and urges bars and restaurants to close by 8:00 p.m.“I’m terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8:00 p.m. and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings,” Suga said at a meeting in the Japanese parliament on January 27.“Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public’s understanding,” the prime minister added.Japanese weekly magazines published separate reports on January 26 revealing that Matsumoto Jun and Toyama Kiyohiko — two legislators from Japan’s conservative ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) — had frequented Tokyo bars and restaurants late into the night despite a federal edict prohibiting such outings.Matsumoto dined at an Italian restaurant in Tokyo until around 9 p.m. on January 18 before visiting two hostess bars in the posh Ginza district. He left the last establishment after 11:00 p.m., according to a report by Shukan Shincho magazine, which included photos of the lawmaker’s night out.“Toyama visited a members-only club in Ginza with an acquaintance shortly past 11:00 p.m. on January 22,” Shukan Bunshun magazine reported on January 26.Matsumoto told reporters on Tuesday that he “had only been drinking until 7:00 p.m.” on the night of January 18 and that he “visited the establishments to listen to their requests and petitions,” presumably related to Tokyo’s current state of emergency, which urges restaurants and bars in the city to limit their service and hours.“I regret that my behavior itself was a bit thoughtless. I took those actions during the night as I’m stuck (with duties) during the day,” Matsumoto said.Hostess bars have been likened to an extension of the office in Japan, with some companies reportedly footing the bill for staff who use the establishments to seal business deals.Toyama told reporters on Tuesday that after having dinner at a Tokyo restaurant until around 8:00 p.m. on January 22, he was invited to another establishment. The lawmaker denied drinking at the high-end night club he visited.“I’d like to fully exercise self-restraint in my behavior so I won’t take this kind of action again. I’m seriously reflecting on what I did,” Toyama added.Matsumoto is a senior legislator and member of the LDP. Toyama is a member of the LDP’s junior coalition partner Komeito, also a conservative party. Prime Minister Suga is the LDP’s current president.Japan’s federal government declared a limited state of emergency in Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures on January 7 in response to a surging number of new Chinese coronavirus cases at the time. The edict focused largely on restricting service or shutting down Tokyo-area bars and restaurants. It also encouraged people in the affected communities to work from home and avoid non-essential outings. About 30 percent of Japan’s population of 127 million reside in the national capital region. Tokyo’s limited state of emergency is currently slated to last until February 7, though Japanese government officials are said to be mulling an extension of the order for an additional month past that date, Kyodo News reported on Wednesday.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthJapannightclubstate of emergencySuga Yoshihidetokyo.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
564,"Russia’s population dropped by over half a million people between January 2020 and January 2021, the country’s Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) revealed on Thursday. The drop is the largest on record since 2005.According to Rosstat, Russia’s population was documented as 146.238 million people as of January 1, 2021. A year ago, that number was 146.748 million. Russia’s state news agency TASS described the drop as the “first dramatic decline” since 2005, and the first time since 2017 that the population dropped to under 146.8 million people.Russia, whose economy has been stagnant for decades under the poor management of President Vladimir Putin, faced extraordinary challenges in 2020, as did most of the world in the face of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Russia has documented 3.8 million cases of Chinese coronavirus as of Friday, one of the world’s highest rates of infection particularly in light of allegations that the Russian government had undercounted its cases. Moscow has attributed 71,054 deaths to the virus.The Moscow Times noted that the pandemic appeared to significantly hurt the nation’s population, contributing to a “record-setting 184,600 excess deaths between January and November.” During that same time, 1.9 million Russians died in total.“At the same time, birth rates declined by 4.4% from 1.36 million from January-November 2019 to 1.3 million in the same period of 2020,” the Times added.Russian officials addressed the pandemic, much like officials elsewhere, by limiting economic activity to lessen contact that could facilitate infection, which has hindered its economic growth. Concerns about public health, a limited job market, and growing disenchantment with the government that is fueling the opposition movement of dissident Alexei Navalny appear to be factoring into Russia’s low birth rate and migration statistics, and thus the decline in population.Russian propaganda network RT noted on Thursday that Russia’s population peaked in 2018; unlike neighboring countries facing population crises like China and Japan, Russia has already reached a point of overall population decline. Putin has attempted in the past to facilitate immigration to Russia, RT claimed, but the move has largely failed, partly due to travel limitations in the pandemic era.RT did not note that Russia’s economy does not appear to be offering much to migrants. Among Rosstat’s other revelations this week is the state of the nation’s finances, which has declined significantly in the past year. An estimated 20 million Russians currently live under the poverty line, an increase of 400,000 households. Living standards generally are lower than they have been for a decade.“Real disposable incomes — a closely tracked indicator of Russian households’ financial wellbeing — dropped by 3.5% in 2020, Rosstat found,” the Moscow Times noted. “They now stand more than 10% below levels recorded in 2013, the last year of solid growth before Russia’s annexation of Crimea and a slump in world oil prices pushed the economy into recession.”Russian officials and senior economic figures have attempted to portray Rosstat’s latest data as a positive for the Putin regime, noting that, percentage-wise, Russia is faring better than some other countries economically during the pandemic. Construction and agriculture grew as industries in the past year despite pandemic concerns, and unemployment statistically fell, though experts have cast doubt on whether the official figures truly reflect the state of employment in the country. The head of VTB, the second-biggest bank in Russia, said during a conversation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week that he believed that Russia’s economy would return to its lackluster pre-pandemic performance as soon as fall 2021.“We feel reasonably optimistic about this and we hope that by autumn the Russian economy will return to the pre-crisis level,” chief executive Andrey Kostin said.In an early January analysis, the Moscow Times cited economic experts agreeing that Russia has lost less of its economic power than some peer states.“Other countries are doing much worse,” Russian economist Sergei Guriev is quoted as saying in late 2020. “Advanced economies on average will lose 6% of their GDP — many European economies will lose 10%,” as opposed to Russia’s predicted four percent.Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance (IIF), told the newspaper that Russia appears to be economically viable, but only in short-term indicators.“In the short-run we have stability — low government debt, low external debt and very high reserves. You’d say this is fantastic, right? But the issue is that over the medium-term we have every possible imaginable problem: an inability to generate growth,” she said.The lack of significant economic prospects appears to have made the bombshell accusation by Navalny, a dissident who recently suffered an apparently poisoning with the Russian nerve agent Novichok, that Putin has spent billions on a personal palace particularly insulting to Russians. Navalny fled to Germany following his poisoning with the help of his team. There, he recovered from a coma as German doctors investigated the possible origin of his ailment and discovered evidence of Novichok use. A recovered Navalny accused Moscow of poisoning him and vowed to return home despite the Kremlin making clear he would face immediate arrest. Upon landing in Russia last week, police detained him.Navalny’s team released a report, including video, last week while the opposition leader was behind bars alleging that Putin had spent billions of dollars on a personal palace on the Black Sea.“There are impregnable fences, its own port, its own security, a church, its own permit system, a no-fly zone and even its own border checkpoint. It is absolutely a separate state within Russia,” Navalny said.Putin’s denial of any knowledge about the estate has not stopped nationwide protests against his regime, which are expected to continue on Saturday.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaEconomyNational SecurityAlexei Navalnybirth ratecoronavirusEconomicsPopulationRussiaVladimir Putin.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
565,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte urged children to stay home and watch TV on Monday as he reimposed a stay-at-home order for Filipino youth aged 10 to 14 amid an outbreak of a new coronavirus strain in the country.“Go back to your homes. And besides … those 10 years old to 14, and those older are the ones difficult to manage, but these aged 10, 11, 12, they’re good just with the TV [sic]. They can glue their attention to the TV the whole day,” Duterte said in a pre-recorded public address broadcast nationwide on January 25.Duterte’s re-imposition of the stay-at-home order reversed a decision by the Philippine government announced just two days earlier on January 22 allowing people “aged 10 to 65 to go outside their homes in areas under the MGCQ,” the Manila Bulletin reported January 25. MGCQ stands for Modified General Community Quarantine. Several Philippine regions have been under various degrees of quarantine since last March as part of the government’s efforts to curb the spread of the Chinese coronavirus.“My decision is a precaution because there is a strain discovered in the Cordillera [region] that is very similar to the strain from the United Kingdom. How it got there is beyond me,” Duterte said in his Monday address.“I’m just afraid because this new strain strikes young children,” the president added.Health authorities in the Philippine mountain region of Cordillera recently detected a new variant of coronavirus in the provincial capital, Bontoc. The British variant was first identified in the U.K. late last year and is believed to be up to 70 percent more contagious than previous strains of coronavirus found in the U.K.The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) said on Monday it had identified eight Filipinos who recently returned to the Cordillera region from the U.K. and may have contributed to the area’s mutant coronavirus outbreak.“The clustering of cases in … in Bontoc was reported to have begun with the returning Filipino from [the] United Kingdom who arrived in the town with his wife on December 14, through a private vehicle after testing negative for Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus],” the Philippine Inquirer reported.The DOH on January 22 confirmed 17 new cases of the U.K. variant in Cordillera, including infections in three children. There is no evidence at press time, however, that the new variant is specifically contagious among children.The Philippines’ total coronavirus caseload is the second-highest in Southeast Asia after Indonesia. The nation has recorded 518,407 infections and 10,481 deaths from the virus as of Tuesday.AsiaHealthNational SecuritycoronavirushealthPhilippinesRodrigo Duterte.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
566,"Farmers’ protests in the Indian national capital, Delhi, turned deadly Tuesday after a farmer turned over his tractor and died.“A protesting farmer died after his tractor overturned at Central Delhi’s ITO [junction] during the farmers’ tractor parade on Tuesday,” police in the Indian national capital said on January 26, according to the Times of India.“The man died as his tractor overturned at ITO where many farmers participating in the parade had reached from the Ghazipur border after taking a detour of the pre-agreed route for the march [sic],” a senior Delhi police officer said.“The man was driving the tractor and he came under the vehicle as it overturned,” police added.Tens of thousands of farmers have been camped out on the outskirts of Delhi since November to protest recently passed agricultural reforms.A parade was scheduled in the national capital Tuesday in honor of India’s Republic Day, which commemorates India’s adoption of its constitution on January 26, 1950. Delhi police had instructed the farmers that they were allowed to continue their protests in Delhi suburbs Tuesday only after the annual Republic Day parade concluded. Police provided the farmers with specific routes for them to use Tuesday that were largely confined to the capital’s outskirts. Thousands of farmers defied official requests Tuesday morning, however, diverging from their designated march routes to enter Delhi.“[N]umerous farmers rode tractors, motorbikes, horses, and even cranes to cross the national capital’s borders into the city,” the Times of India reported.“At ITO [junction], the protesters broke police barricade[s], vandalized DTC [Delhi Transport Corporation] buses parked in the middle of the road as barricades, and clashed with security personnel in front of the Police headquarters. Protesters also broke barricades at Karnal bypass and Tikri border,” according to the newspaper.Delhi police were greatly outnumbered by the thousands of farmers and used tear gas in a largely futile effort to push the mob back. At least 83 police officers were injured in the riot, with many sustaining serious wounds, according to NDTV.“[H]undreds of protesters could be seen chasing police personnel with sticks and ramming their tractors into the buses parked by police,” the Times of India relayed on Tuesday, adding that, “Some farmers armed with swords clash[ed] with police.”“Farmers chase[ed] police with their tractors, damaging more DTC buses near ITO” as police desperately trying to prevent them from moving towards Delhi’s historic Red Fort, located at the heart of the city. By noon, hundreds of farmers “riding tractors, bikes, and cars” managed to breach the fortress’s gates. A number of men clambered onto the fortress’s walls and domes, and some hoisted “farmer union flags and [a] saffron pennant with a Sikh religious symbols” alongside the Indian national flag on the fort’s first rampart, according to the Times of India.The majority of the farmers gathered near Delhi since November have traveled from the Sikh-dominated Indian state of Punjab, which borders the capital region. Another Indian state with a notable Sikh population, Haryana, has sent a large number of farmers to participate in the rallies as well. The farmers are protesting three agricultural reforms passed by the Indian Congress in September that they say undermine their traditional farm price protections.“The farmers, who form a powerful political constituency, fear the laws passed in September could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers,” NDTV reported on December 4.“Farm groups say the government is trying to end a decades-old policy of providing them with an assured minimum price for producing staples, such as wheat and rice,” the Indian news outlet added.AsiaCrimeNational SecurityDelhiFarmersIndiaNew Delhiproteststractor.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
567,"Tokyo’s hosting of the next Olympic Games this summer is “up to the U.S.,” a Tokyo Olympics Organizing Committee member said on Wednesday.U.S. President Joe Biden is “dealing with a tough situation with the coronavirus,” Takahashi Haruyuki, a member of the executive board of Japan’s Olympic organizing committee, told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in an article published January 27.“But if he makes a positive statement about the Olympics going ahead, we’d gain strong momentum,” Takahashi said.“It’s up to the U.S. I hate to say it, but [International Olympic Committee (IOC) President] Thomas Bach and the IOC are not the ones who are able to make the decision about the Games,” he added. “They don’t have that level of leadership.”The IOC responded to Takahashi’s remarks in a statement to the WSJ, saying “his comments are obsolete.”“It is regrettable that Mr. Takahashi does not know the facts,” the IOC’s statement read.The committee that led Tokyo’s bid to secure the 2020 Olympic Games paid Takahashi, a former advertising executive, $8.2 million to spearhead the campaign. The payments made Takahashi “the single largest recipient of money from the Tokyo bid committee, which was mostly funded by Japanese companies,” according to Reuters. After securing the games, the Tokyo committee named Takahashi to its board.The Tokyo games – currently scheduled to start on July 23, 2021 – were postponed last year from their original summer 2020 start date due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Kyodo News published a poll on January 10 revealing that 80 percent of the Japanese public was in favor of canceling or postponing Tokyo’s 2021 summer games due to difficulties posed by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Tokyo on January 7 entered a month-long state of emergency to curb the spread of coronavirus in the national capital area amid a spike in the number of daily new cases.The U.S. contributes the largest pool of athletes and television advertising money to the Olympic Games. Observers believe that a U.S. endorsement of Tokyo pushing forward to host the next summer games “would be influential with a skeptical Japanese public and reassure other countries that aren’t sure about sending athletes to Tokyo,” according to the WSJ.British newspaper the Times published a report on January 21 alleging that the Japanese government had “privately concluded that the Tokyo Olympics will have to be canceled” because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Citing an unidentified senior member of Japan’s ruling party, the Times said that Tokyo was now focusing on securing the Olympic Games for the next available year, 2032.Both the Japanese government and Japan’s Olympic Committee dismissed the Times report as false shortly after it was published.“We clearly deny the report,” Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Manabu Sakai said at a news conference.Japan Olympic Committee head Yasuhiro Yamashita described the Times report as “a fabrication” in a statement to Reuters.“International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach held phone calls on Friday [January 22] with national Olympic committees around the world to reassure them about the Games and discuss coronavirus vaccinations for athletes.

568,"Chinese “patriots” governing Hong Kong have guided the city from a state of “chaos” to stability over the past several months, Chinese dictator Xi Jinping told Hong Kong government authorities on Wednesday.“Hong Kong’s transition from chaos to stability has once again demonstrated that the principle of ‘patriots governing Hong Kong’ must be always upheld to ensure the steady and sustained implementation of ‘one country, two systems,'” Xi said during a January 27 video conference with Hong Kong government leaders.“It is the fundamental principle that concerns national sovereignty, security, and development interests, as well as Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability in the long run,” he added.Wednesday’s meeting covered the Hong Kong government’s work in 2020 and its response to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, among other topics, according to China’s official state press agency, Xinhua.Beijing imposed an illegal national security law on Hong Kong last summer to quash a pro-democracy protest movement that had persisted in the city over the preceding year. The legislation undermined the city’s limited autonomy, which was allowed under a “One Country, Two Systems” policy agreed to by Beijing in 1997 after Britain handed Hong Kong back to China post-colonial rule.Under the “One Country, Two Systems” policy, laws passed in Beijing do not legally apply in Hong Kong. The national security law defies this agreement, allowing Hong Kong police to arrest citizens for perpetrating new crimes listed under the law. Collusion with a foreign government, secession, terrorism, and “subversion of state power,” a vague catchall, are among the new crimes listed under the national security law punishable by a minimum of ten years in prison. Hong Kong security forces have ramped up detentions under the law in recent weeks, arresting and assigning prison sentences to the pro-democracy movement’s leaders.“What should be noted is that since the National People’s Congress Standing Committee adopted the national security law in the HKSAR, you have led the HKSAR government in resolutely enforcing it, stopping violence and chaos in accordance with the law and working to bring Hong Kong back on track,” Xi told Lam during Wednesday’s conference, referring to Hong Kong by its official Chinese Communist Party name, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).“On major issues such as national security, you have taken a firm stand and assumed responsibilities, demonstrating your love of and deep sense of responsibility to the motherland and Hong Kong,” Xi told the Hong Kong leader.“The central authorities fully acknowledge your performance and the performance of the HKSAR government in fulfilling duties,” Xi added.AsiaNational SecurityCarrie LamChinaHong KongXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
569,"The head of the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) investigative team in Wuhan, China, told the Chinese propaganda outlet Global Times on Friday that he believed it was “still worth” visiting for clues on the origins of the Chinese coronavirus despite the government’s wholesale destruction of evidence there.A leaked Chinese government document, published by the South China Morning Post, revealed that the first confirmed case of Chinese coronavirus was diagnosed on November 17, 2019, in Wuhan, a central metropolis home to about 11 million people. No evidence exists suggesting that the coronavirus, never before documented in humans, had surfaced anywhere else in the world before the Wuhan cases.Chinese Communist Party officials stated initially that they believed the origin of the virus was the Huanan seafood and live meat market in Wuhan, but have since denied this and claimed that the U.S. Army unleashed the virus on the world, providing no evidence for this claim. Some scientists have speculated that the virus jumped from an exotic animal to humans through exposure at a live animal market.Chinese officials openly admitted in 2020 to destroying early samples of the coronavirus and “disinfecting” the Huanan site, considered a “wet market” due to the presence of live animals, killed on-site for consumption. While public health experts and animal rights activists have long decried wet markets as disease hubs and sites of extreme animal abuse, the W.H.O. gave its blessing to China reopening its wet markets in April 2020, at the initial height of the pandemic.Now, over a year later, the W.H.O. has sent a team into Wuhan to investigate the “origin” of the pandemic. Responding to skepticism that any usable evidence remains at the origin site – or that the notoriously repressive Communist Party would allow the W.H.O. access to it, even if it existed – the head of the W.H.O. investigative team, Peter Ben Embarek, told the Global Times he expected to find critical information on his journey.“[We hope to] understand the setting, see the places where cases were linked, reconstruct the initial event there, search for records of animals, products traded there,” the newspaper quoted the public health investigator as saying, “and possibly talking to some of the merchants who were there at that time.”“There are information and records everywhere, so it is still worth exploring these places,” he insisted.Ben Embarek said his team expects to be able to visit the grounds of the Huanan market, several hospitals that diagnosed early cases, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory that became the subject of speculation after former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Chinese coronavirus “likely came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”Ben Embarek claimed that “there will be no restrictions or limitations in working with our Chinese colleagues or in visiting places the joint team deem of interest,” contradicting reports this week that the Chinese government had begun censoring relatives of early coronavirus victims to prevent them from having access to the W.H.O. team.Zhang Hai, a member of a WeChat social media group of families of Wuhan victims, denounced this week that the Communist Party had shut down the group inexplicably.“When the WHO arrived in Wuhan, (authorities) forcibly demolished (the group). As a result we have lost contact with many members,” Zhang said, adding he believed Beijing was “afraid” of what these families could tell the investigators.Zhang made headlines in May after accusing the government of Wuhan of infecting his father, Zhang Lifa, with coronavirus, causing his death. His father reportedly attended an appointment at a Wuhan hospital for an unrelated medical issue, then suddenly died, allegedly of coronavirus infection.“The surgery had been very successful, and he was in good condition,” Zhang Hai told Al Jazeera at the time. “But soon, he began to have fevers frequently and before long his condition worsened and he went into a coma.”Zhang has attempted to sue the Chinese government for their role in his father’s infection, and claims several other families of coronavirus victims have done the same, but the Chinese court system has failed to allow the lawsuits to advance.Beijing has long delayed the arrival of a W.H.O. investigative team to Wuhan, most recently blocking some members of the team from entering the country and forcing those allowed in to endure a strict quarantine for two weeks. The delays will make finding critical evidence at key sites difficult given its erosion over time.Officials with China’s National Health Commission admitted in May that they had destroyed early samples of the virus collected for research, necessary to document the virus’s genome and be able to identify it. The destruction, one official claimed, was necessary to “prevent the risk to laboratory biological safety and prevent secondary disasters caused by unidentified pathogens.”Wuhan officials also closed off and regularly “disinfected” the Huanan market for months, likely destroying any evidence that may have been helpful to the W.H.O. team.The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, denounced accusations on Friday that Beijing had intentionally harmed the probe into the virus’s origins.“The trip of the W.H.O. team revived the continuous blame that China has impeded the efforts on COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] tracing,” the People’s Daily noted.  “The Western hysteria that surrounds China’s delay in origin tracing has been heightened since early January. Politicians like Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had urged an early W.H.O.-led investigation into China as soon as possible.”“Some Western politicians seem obsessed with hyping up the anti-China sentiment,” the newspaper concluded, before repeating the poorly substantiated allegation that the Chinese coronavirus originated in Maryland.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacommunismcoronavirusWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
570,"The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) will take all necessary measures to “crush” efforts supporting Taiwanese sovereignty because “Taiwan independence means war,” a spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense said Thursday.Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said a “handful” of people in Taiwan are seeking the island’s independence at a monthly news briefing on January 28.“We warn those ‘Taiwan independence’ elements: those who play with fire will burn themselves, and ‘Taiwan independence’ means war,” Wu said.The U.S. Navy deployed its Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group to sail through the South China Sea near Taiwan last weekend in an action supporting “freedom of the seas.” Shortly afterward, China’s air force responded by deploying eight bombers, four fighter jets, and one anti-submarine warfare plane to cross into Taiwan’s southwestern Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). China’s PLA has ordered such air sorties more than 100 times since mid-September in an effort to intimidate the sovereign island, which Beijing considers a renegade territory.When reported asked him Thursday about China’s most recent air force activity near Taiwan on January 23, Wu responded: “The military activities carried out by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army in the Taiwan Strait are necessary actions to address the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty and security.”“They are a solemn response to external interference and provocations by ‘Taiwan independence’ forces,” he added.“Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, and the Taiwan question falls under China’s internal affairs and brooks no interference from any external forces,” China’s defense ministry spokesman said.In reality, Taiwan has been a sovereign state for decades, with its own governmental structure, military, and society.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly stated that Taiwan is an independent country despite Beijing’s insistence that the island, located off China’s southeastern coast, is a breakaway territory rightfully belonging to China. Beijing has vowed to forcefully reunify Taiwan with mainland China if necessary.Six Chinese fighter jets entered Taiwan’s southwest ADIZ on January 28, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND).“Four J-10 multirole fighter aircraft, a KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft, and a Y-8 electronic signals intelligence plane entered the airspace between Taiwan and the Dongsha (Pratas) Islands in the South China Sea,” MND data revealed Thursday.“In response to the incursion, Taiwan’s Air Force scrambled planes to monitor the Chinese aircraft, issued radio warnings and mobilized air defense assets until the Chinese aircraft left the ADIZ,” the MND said.“An ADIZ, which usually extends beyond sovereign airspace, is established by a country to allow early identification, location and control of approaching foreign aircraft. However, unlike territorial airspace, no legal foundation for the ADIZ is explicitly stipulated in international law,” Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency noted Thursday.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaTaiwan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
571,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian responded to repeated claims that China is committing genocide against its ethnic Uyghur minority by repeatedly chanting “China has no genocide,” a bizarre moment that does not appear in the official transcript of his regular press briefing.The Global Times, a state-run propaganda outlet, nonetheless dedicated an article to the occasion.China has faced years of genocide accusations in the wake of the Communist Party’s construction of concentration camps beginning in 2018, used to house millions of Uyghurs and other members of majority-Muslim ethnic minorities, primarily Kazakh and Kyrgyz people. Survivors of the camps say that rape, torture, slavery, communist indoctrination, and forced sterilizations are rampant there; the atrocities are believed to still be taking place in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.The Chinese Communist Party has also faced accusations of enslaving camp survivors, shipping them to factories or cotton farms nationwide and forcing them to endure arduous labor with little to no pay.China has responded to the accusations by claiming the concentration camps are “vocational training centers” meant to help uneducated Uyghurs develop job skills more in concert with the demands of the modern Chinese market. Those sent to engage in forced labor in factories outside of Xinjiang had “graduated,” officials claimed, from their training.Attention returned to the human rights atrocities in Xinjiang after, as one of his final acts in office, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the suffering of the Uyghur people as a “genocide.” Antony Blinken, President Joe Biden’s choice to replace Pompeo, has publicly agreed with that description.“I think we’re very much in agreement,” Blinken said of Pompeo during the congressional hearing to approve his nomination as secretary of state. “The forcing of men, women, and children into concentration camps; trying to, in effect, re-educate them to be adherents to the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide.”According to the Global Times, Zhao responded to a question about Blinken’s remarks this week by repeatedly stating, without providing any evidence, that China was not committing genocide.“The most important thing should be repeated three times — China has no genocide; China has no genocide; China has no genocide, period,” the newspaper quoted Zhao as saying.“No matter what malicious purposes those people have in sowing discord, they will not destroy the stability of Xinjiang, nor will they stop Xinjiang stepping into a better period,” he reportedly affirmed.The repeated incantations did not make it into the official transcript of Zhao’s remarks.“There’s never ever such thing as genocide in China. Period,” the transcript read.“Pompeo and his likes have concocted lies of the century about Xinjiang and slung mud at China’s Xinjiang policy. We never accept that. We have repeatedly refuted those rumors and stated the facts,” Zhao is quoted as saying. The official transcript shows Zhao claimed Xinjiang citizens “live a happy life in a stable environment,” a common refrain from Chinese officials.A firm verbal stance against genocide in Xinjiang is one of the few areas of foreign policy, the other being Venezuela, where the Biden administration has not deviated from the status quo under former President Donald Trump. The Trump administration took decisive action against the Chinese enslavement of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang by banning several products from the region from entering the United States, most prominently any Xinjiang cotton. China has marketed Xinjiang cotton — about 84 percent of the nation’s cotton is produced in Xinjiang — as a superior quality product, prompting international companies like Uniqlo to advertise that they use the slave-produced material.Following Pompeo’s example, Blinken suggested during his confirmation hearing that the Biden administration would continue to outlaw importing slave-produced goods from Xinjiang as evidence mounted regarding which items were vulnerable to being made through such abuse.“I think we should be looking at making sure that we are not importing products that are made with forced labor from Xinjiang,” Blinken suggested. “We need to make sure that we are also not exporting technologies and tools that could be used to further their repression. That’s one place to start.”Experts have warned there is no way of guaranteeing that any product made in China was not compromised by slavery in the supply chain. A study published last year by the Australian Strategy Policy Institute (ASPI) identified over 83 multinational companies — including big-name brands such as BMW, Nike, Apple, and Nintendo — that used factories outside of Xinjiang that had filled employee gaps by buying Uyghur slaves from the government.International legal norms define genocide as a limited series of acts “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” Among the acts listed are killing individual members of the group, “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part,” and “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group,” according to the U.N. Convention on Genocide.Pompeo emphasized evidence of the latter in declaring China’s acts against the Uyghurs a genocide. Women who have survived the nation’s concentration camps have testified to forced sterilizations or forced abortions if they were pregnant at the time. Some mothers have stated camp administrators killed their infants. Uyghur doctors who have escaped Xinjiang have stated the government forced them to systematically sterilize women or kill their newborns, evidence of an attempt to eliminate the Uyghur community entirely.China admits to many of these policies and has boasted that it has successfully liberated Uyghur women from being “baby-making machines.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityAntony BlinkenChinacommunismGenocideMike PompeoUyghursXinjiangZhao Lijian.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
572,"The Chinese Communist Party began early celebrations for the anniversary of allegedly successful lockdowns imposed on millions of people in “heroic” Wuhan, the home city of the Chinese coronavirus, on Saturday, amid a resurgence of the virus in some of the country’s biggest cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.The outbreak, which has seen “de facto” lockdowns in at least 11 regions of the northeast in addition to the Shanghai and Hong Kong actions, began about two weeks after China organized a massive New Year’s Eve party for thousands of people in Wuhan, seen in photos reveling in tightly packed quarters. Public health experts have discouraged mass gatherings in nations where the virus is still circulation, but China nonetheless held the party and compared it favorably to cancellations of similar events in places like New York City.In January 2020, the Chinese Communist Party — which evidence later revealed had information that indicated the spread of a contagious disease in Wuhan — allowed millions of people to leave the city and travel around the world. Prior to the lockdowns, but amid clear community spread of the virus, the Chinese government attempted to hold the world’s largest banquet, attended by 130,000 people eating family-style and sharing plates and silverware. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, admitted at the time that 5 million people — almost half the population of the city — left Wuhan before the lockdowns were implemented.Leaked footage out of Wuhan highlighted the brutality of the lockdowns. Officials appeared to weld doors of homes shut, trapping residents inside. Multiple reports surfaced of individuals with special needs, in some cases children, dying at home because they were not allowed to access medical care for conditions other than coronavirus. Many others committed suicide.The Chinese government debuted a propaganda film this weekend in Wuhan cinemas, which are currently open, to celebrate the alleged success of the Wuhan lockdown. The film, Days and Nights in Wuhan, “features contributions from 30 filmmakers portraying the suffering and sacrifices made by the city’s 11 million residents, medical staff and front-line workers,” according to the South China Morning Post. The newspaper noted that the Chinese Communist Party is producing at least three documentaries to promote the idea that Wuhan’s handling of the outbreak was efficient and successful.A study published in March by the University of Southampton’s WorldPop population mapping group found that, had Chinese, and particularly Wuhan, officials properly handled the coronavirus outbreak, they may have prevented as many as 95 percent of coronavirus cases in the country. Chinese officials insisted well into late January 2020 that there was no evidence for human-to-human transmission of the virus, though Taiwanese medical officials had already begun using isolation techniques on patients in late December 2019.“We wanted to record the journey of battling against the Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] epidemic via motion picture. Some of the details, including the intense care, anxious waiting, heartbreaking farewells and hopeful rebirths, might strike a chord with viewers,” director Cao Jinling told Chinese state media.The Global Times, a Chinese state propaganda outlet, accompanied the debut of the documentary with an extensive profile of several Wuhan “heroes” who effusively praised the government’s lockdown. The Global Times claimed the city’s residents were initially “puzzled” by the outbreak, but ultimately grew fanatical in their support of them after witnessing the alleged failures of the rest of the world, particularly America.“When the city returned to bustling normal life in April, and Western countries, one by one, faced a more severe onslaught of the coronavirus, many Wuhan people, initially puzzled by their government’s decision to seal off the city, became staunch supporters of the decision,” the Times claimed. “The decision that has little parallel in modern society initially puzzled many locals, who soon turned into firm supporters of the strict management after seeing the city bounce back fast from its COVID-19 swoon while some Western countries, one-by-one, dragged their feet into coronavirus lulls.”The Global Times claimed that China was “bouncing back fastest and strongest from the pandemic” as opposed to “countries like the US, which have been through several rounds of lockdowns” and continue to see cases of Chinese coronavirus.“Those Western countries have no right to lambast Wuhan, with itself being dragged with high daily records. What are these ‘human rights’ they are always talking about? Keeping people alive is the most import part of human rights,” one of the alleged Wuhan residents, identified as “Chen,” is quoted as saying.The Global Times piece did not mention the current nationwide outbreak of Chinese coronavirus ravaging China. In mid-January 2021, the Times itself reported that at least 11 regions in the northeast of the country had launched “de facto” lockdowns. Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, is experiencing one of the most severe outbreaks in the country, alongside the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. Beijing itself is significantly limiting residents’ movements. Elsewhere, in Shanxi province, west of Beijing, authorities have begun preparing for another coronavirus surge.This week, Shanghai began locking down densely populated neighborhoods to prevent the further spread of the virus. The formerly autonomous city of Hong Kong also appears to be preparing for major lockdowns in several neighborhoods that would trap tens of thousands of residents, the largest lockdown in the city since the outbreak began.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismcoronavirusWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
573,"China’s state-run Global Times reported Tuesday that Shanghai is exploring a “pilot” program in which the government helps women who wish to have children but are not in a position to have them to freeze their eggs for future use.The proposal follows years of panic at the highest levels of the Communist Party over China’s declining birth rate, which has continued to plummet despite dictator Xi Jinping easing the repressive “one-child policy” that governed Chinese families in 2015. The Mao-era “one-child policy” made it illegal for a woman to have more than one child, resulting in mass forced abortions, sterilizations, and infanticides.The Chinese Communist Party has boasted the anti-childbirth policy “prevented” 400 million births, a toll that includes both abortions and killings of infants. A significant percentage of those whose lives were “prevented” were girls, resulting in a devastating sex imbalance in the Chinese population that has contributed to the decline in the birth rate.The Global Times described the proposed egg freezing program as a particular help for women who have undergone treatment for cancer, which often leads to infertility. The plan is reportedly the brainchild of attorney Qin Suo, a “professional woman who gave birth at an advanced maternal age.” The propaganda newspaper identified Qin as a local government official in addition to her day job as a lawyer.“Three political advisors in Shanghai proposed to set up a public frozen egg bank in a pilot exploration scheme to help women in need, especially cancer patients who might lose fertility after receiving medical treatment,” the Times narrated. “[T] he political advisors suggested setting up a public egg bank and carrying out centralized management on frozen eggs to raise efficiency.”The outlet quoted Qin as stating that the United States considers freezing women’s eggs a “standard medical service” and that China has much to gain from following that example. Among the hurdles the program would face is the fact that the Communist Party in Shanghai strictly regulates who has access to egg-freezing, limiting the list to “couples with a history of infertility and cancer patients who expect to preserve their fertility before undergoing surgery or chemotherapy.” Most preservation of eggs is not freezing in China, however, which means most expire after five years, the newspaper noted.Chinese state media have been advocating for the Communist Party to implement programs that not just repeal limitations on having children, but actively incentivize couples to do so given the dire state of the country’s birth rate. The latest available data show that 14.65 million babies were born in China in 2019, a record-low in this century and a number last documented in China in 1961, at the height of Mao-era persecution and poverty. A scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Yi Fuxian, called that number “seriously overestimated” and claimed the true number of births that year was closer to 10 million.A growing population is necessary for a healthy economy, given that older citizens retire or otherwise exit the workforce, leaving vacancies that need to be filled. Experts expect that the 2020 birth rate will be significantly lower than 2019’s given the extreme coronavirus lockdowns that China implemented nationwide and the crisis status of many of its hospitals, in which overcrowding could result in an increase in infant or maternal mortality.Chinese experts believe that the nation’s population will begin to decline in 2028.China Daily, another state-run propaganda newspaper, warned in December that “simply allowing a couple to have a second child does not mean they will have one, as the costs of raising children, escalating housing prices and mounting career pressures on women dampen couples’ desire to have more children.”“The development will have wide social and economic implications. For instance, if the country’s labor productivity has not reached a certain level, the decrease in working-age population means the decline of national wealth,” China Daily noted. “On the other hand, the increase in the elderly population will raise the burden on the economy and society. In fact, some provinces are already struggling to meet the pension demands.”The Chinese Communist Party, it urged, must help “improve people’s livelihoods” to encourage expanding families.The Global Times this week highlighted, in a bizarrely positive fashion given the general disposition of the Party on the topic, the revelation by two Chinese celebrities that they had secretly had a baby together out of wedlock.“Some netizens supported the celebrities’ choice, saying that raising children should not be automatically tied to marriage,” the Times noted, referring to online users of Chinese social media. The Communist Party strictly regulates opinions on its social media platforms, meaning the support for the two celebrities would only appear on the sites if the government wished it to.The “one-child” policy and subsequent remaining limitations on family expansion apply only to ethnic Han Chinese citizens. Ethnic minorities are legally allowed to expand their families further, but are subject to much more brutal methods of birth “control.” In Western China, the Communist Party has pursued a campaign of forcibly sterilizing Uyghur women, which the U.S. government deemed “genocide” last week.The Chinese government has defended the forced sterilization of Uyghurs by stating that it made them “no longer baby-making machines.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaEconomyNational Securitybirth rateChinacommunismGlobal TimesOne Child Policy.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
574,"Government authorities in Hong Kong are reportedly planning to lock down thousands of people within the Yau Tsim Mong area of Kowloon district starting January 23 to contain a Chinese coronavirus outbreak in the area.Hong Kong authorities are expected to seal off roughly 150 residential buildings — home to 4,000 to 9,000 residents — across Yau Tsim Mong starting Saturday morning after a cluster of new Chinese coronavirus cases in the city were traced to the area.“Hong Kong on Friday confirmed 61 new Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] cases, 55 of which were locally transmitted. Twenty-four local cases came from Yau Tsim Mong,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.The city will reportedly deploy more than 1,700 officers from various Hong Kong security services to Yau Tsim Mong to enforce the lockdown, which will prohibit residents from leaving their homes unless they present a negative Chinese coronavirus test result.Each residential building under the lockdown will be “guarded by government staff to ensure people leaving the building have a negative test result. They will also send enforcement officials to each flat to ensure residents have taken a test,” local news outlet HK01 reported. Authorities ordered all shops in the affected areas of Yau Tsim Mong to close by Friday evening, with government employees planning to provide “food and daily necessities to residents in need,” according to SCMP.Hong Kong government authorities refused to confirm that Yau Tsim Mong would be sealed off over the weekend when asked about the strict measure by journalists on January 22 amid multiple reports on the lockdown by local media outlets, some of whom cited unnamed city government sources.Yau Tsim Mong district councilors called a press conference on Friday evening Hong Kong time to demand that the city government clarify if it will impose a partial lockdown on the district “after a day of swirling rumors that some people could be confined to their homes unless they have proof of a recent negative Covid [Chinese coronavirus] test,” Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) reported on January 22.“Deprived of credible information, many residents had rushed out during the day to stock up on food and other essential goods over fears that they might be stuck inside their homes for days,” Yau Tsim Mong District Council Vice-Chairman Andy Yu said.The district’s residential buildings consist largely of “ageing buildings and subdivided flats populated by lower-income families,” according to the SCMP. Yau Tsim Mong district councilors referred to this problem at Friday’s press conference, positing that “many run-down buildings in the area having ill-fitting, or altered pipes … may be helping to propagate the virus.”Yuen Kwok-yung, a prominent microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said he had “inspected” one Yau Tsim Mong district residential building affected by the local coronavirus outbreak on Friday. He was part of a specialist team deployed to the area by the Hong Kong government to investigate the outbreak’s cause. Yuen told RTHK afterward he “thinks the virus may well have [been] spread via sewage pipes.”AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthHong Konglockdown.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

576,"Afghan authorities have rearrested 600 Taliban members recently freed from prison as part of a U.S.-brokered peace deal between the terror group and the Afghan government, Afghanistan’s national security advisor revealed on Sunday.“We have rearrested 600 of the freed individuals because they were fighting alongside the Taliban despite pledges that they would not rejoin the battlefield,” Afghan national security advisor Hamdullah Mohib told reporters on January 24.Afghanistan’s government released over 5,000 Taliban prisoners last year as part of a February 2020 peace agreement. The Taliban in return freed 1,000 Afghan government security personnel.The prisoner swap was designed as a trust-building exercise ahead of the peace negotiation’s official launch in Doha, Qatar, in September 2020. The talks are technically ongoing but have stalled repeatedly and made little significant process in resolving the power struggle between the Taliban and the internationally-recognized Afghan government. The terror group refuses to accept the Afghan government’s rule over Afghanistan as legitimate and has continued to attack government forces throughout the months-long peace process.“We see that none of the conditions that the Taliban agreed to in the U.S.-Taliban agreement have been fulfilled. We want those conditions to be implemented,” Mohib said on Sunday when announcing the mass rearrest of Taliban militants.Intelligence information suggests that “other freed Taliban prisoners were also involved in making car bombs and directing deadly attacks at Afghan security forces as well as civilians,” in recent months, Mohib added.A spokesman for the Taliban named Zabihullah Mujahid rejected Mohib’s allegations, denying that 600 Taliban members had been rearrested by Afghan authorities.Mujahid told VOA on January 24 that Afghan security forces have allegedly “killed or rearrested up to 40” freed Taliban members “during raids on their homes or on hospitals where they were undergoing medical treatment after being released from jails.”The Taliban has previously accused the U.S. of violating the terms of the Afghan peace deal it helped broker. Taliban spokesman Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi alleged in October that the U.S. military had carried out excessive airstrikes in regions of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban. The act would violate a clause of the agreement prohibiting U.S. forces from launching airstrikes in areas other than combat zones.The Afghan government has repeatedly accused Taliban members freed in the prison swap of returning to fight against state security forces. At least 22 Taliban jihadists were killed in a July 7 clash with Afghan government forces along the Kabul-Jalalabad highway in Laghman province. Most of the Taliban fighters who died in the altercation had been recently released as part of the ongoing peace process, the head of the Afghan Senate, Fazal Hadi Muslimyar, said in a parliamentary address on July 8.The head of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, Abdullah Abdullah, revealed on September 22 that some Taliban prisoners freed during the peace process had already returned to fighting in the country, just two weeks after the launch of peace talks in Doha on September 12.“I do know that some have returned to the battlefield, which is a violation of the agreement that they had made,” Abdullah said in an online conference with the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAfghanistanradical islamTaliban.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
577,"The promotion of unauthorized rallies in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in recent days has been “unacceptable” and the work of “certain provocateurs,” Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday.“The only appropriate stance is in favor of abiding by the law and against the organization of unauthorized activities, let alone attempts to incite young people and children to take part in them,” Peskov said when asked about the possibility of anti-government rallies in Russia on January 23.“There are certain provocateurs who are calling for organizing this action,” he said of the planned demonstrations, which are expected to demand Navalny’s release from jail.“The actions of the provocateurs are clear to us, they are very clear to the law enforcement bodies, and corresponding measures are taken against these provocateurs,” Peskov added.Navalny and his supporters have called for mass protests in Russia on January 23 to demand the dissident’s release from jail after he was detained in Moscow on January 17. Russian government authorities have warned that the demonstrations are considered “illegal” as they are unauthorized by the state. The Kremlin has also opened a criminal case into the protests’ organizers, accusing Navalny’s allies of trying to illegally encourage minors to attend the rallies. Russian police on January 21 charged one of Navalny’s lawyers, Lyubov Sobol, with “calling for an unsanctioned rally in relation to a planned nationwide protest,” Sobol’s lawyer said in statements posted to social media.Navalny, a conspicuous critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government, was jailed upon returning to his native Russia from Germany on January 17. A Moscow court ruled the next day that Navalny will remain in police custody until February 15 while authorities prepare a new trial to determine “whether he violated the terms of a controversial suspended sentence handed down in 2014 by not reporting to authorities in person while in Germany,” the Moscow Times reported.Navalny had been convalescing in Germany for the past five months after he fell seriously ill while on a Russian domestic flight on August 20. Navalny was airlifted from Russia to Germany two days later for medical treatment, where he remained until earlier this month. Evidence suggests that Navalny ingested the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok, German doctors familiar with his case have said. Navalny has since accused the Kremlin of ordering his poisoning. Putin and his government have repeatedly denied involvement in the incident.Navalny has managed to maintain a presence on social media through his lawyers over the past week despite being jailed.“Just in case, I am announcing that I don’t plan to either hang myself on a window grill or cut my veins or throat open with a sharpened spoon,” Navalny wrote in a statement posted to his Instagram account by his lawyers on Friday.“I use the staircase very carefully. They measure my blood pressure every day and it’s like a cosmonaut’s so a sudden heart attack is ruled out.

578,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte must receive his Chinese coronavirus vaccine in private because it will be administered “in the ass,” his spokesman told reporters on Tuesday.When asked by CNN Philippines if Duterte’s stated decision to receive the coronavirus vaccine privately is final, presidential spokesman Harry Roque answered, “I think so. He has said so. As he said, because he is going to be injected in the ass, it cannot be done in public.”Various government health officials in charge of the Philippines’ coronavirus vaccine campaign have pressured Duterte in recent weeks to receive a coronavirus vaccine in public to assure Filipinos of its safety and encourage participation. Duterte volunteered in August to be the first person to receive Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, then in development, adding that he would receive it “in public.” However, since the Philippine government secured coronavirus vaccine supplies from China’s state-run pharmaceutical company, Sinovac Biotech, on January 11, the president has said that healthcare workers will be prioritized for coronavirus vaccination and that government officials will be the last in line.A number of Duterte’s presidential bodyguards were administered coronavirus vaccine candidates as early as October after early samples of the coronavirus vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinopharm were allegedly smuggled into the Philippines from China. The incident is currently under investigation by the Philippine government.At a January 19 press briefing, Roque said he asked Duterte the night before if he would receive one of the first coronavirus vaccines officially available in the Philippines, expected to arrive in February from China.“His answer was, ‘No problem, I will take the vaccine as soon as it is available.’ But he said there is no need to show it to the public. He’s taking the route of the British sovereign, because it was Queen Elizabeth [II] and her husband [Prince Philip] who decided to receive [coronavirus] injections privately,” the presidential spokesman said.When probed by a reporter about Duterte’s stated decision to receive a coronavirus vaccine in private rather than in public on January 21, Roque responded, “That’s his personal decision. I don’t think he has to explain.”Philippine coronavirus vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. admitted the government was grappling with low public confidence in the state’s upcoming vaccination drive in a meeting with Duterte on January 25, suggesting that Duterte’s support of the campaign would help encourage people to get vaccinated.“This is our problem that we should all work on. We know that our … president, will be of great help because the willingness of our countrymen to get vaccinated is decreasing because of the adverse effects of certain brands,” Galvez told reporters during the televised meeting, according to the Manila Bulletin. “At the same time, the anti-vaxxers are getting strong on social media,” he added.“A Pulse Asia survey recently showed that nearly half of Filipinos are not inclined to get the coronavirus vaccine supposedly due to safety concerns. At least 47 percent of the 2,400 survey respondents do not want to be vaccinated, 32 percent are willing to get the shot and 21 percent are undecided. Of those who refuse to get the vaccine, 84 percent claimed they were unsure about its safety,” the Manila Bulletin reported on January 26.When asked by a reporter on January 26 how President Duterte would encourage the Philippine public to engage with the state’s anti-coronavirus campaign, Roque responded by saying that the president recently participated in a public service announcement encouraging Filipinos to follow coronavirus health protocols including wearing sanitary masks.“We recognize the president is [the] best communicator for NTF [National Task Force against coronavirus] and our anti-COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] efforts,” Roque said.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinese coronaviruscoronavirusCoronavirus vaccinehealthPhilippinesRodrigo DuterteVaccinevaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
579,"Authorities in China’s largest city, Shanghai, confirmed three new cases of the Chinese coronavirus Thursday, hours after sealing off two major hospitals connected to the outbreak.Health authorities reportedly detected the new infections at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, located in the city’s downtown Xuhui District, and Renji Hospital, located in the central Huangpu District.According to the Shanghai Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the patients include a 56-year-old man named Li, who works at the Shanghai Cancer Center; a 53-year-old man named Zhou, who works at Renji Hospital and is Li’s neighbor; and a 48-year-old woman named Tian, who is an acquaintance of Li’s.“The man [Li]’s residential community in the city’s Huangpu District has now been categorized as a medium-risk area, a district official said, and all of its residents will be quarantined in designated hotels and tested for the virus,” the Shanghai-based and Chinese Communist Party-run Sixth Tone reported Thursday.Health authorities said they began mass testing for coronavirus at the two hospitals Wednesday. About 6,000 medical workers at the Shanghai Cancer Center had tested negative for the Chinese coronavirus as of Thursday afternoon, Zhang Wenhong, director of the infectious diseases department at Shanghai’s Huashan Hospital, told reporters on January 21. Workers across all Shanghai hospitals will also be tested for the Chinese coronavirus as soon as possible, local media reported Thursday.The infections are Shanghai’s first new locally transmitted cases of coronavirus since November 23. The outbreak in Shanghai joins a nationwide resurgence of the Chinese coronavirus across northern China — including Hebei province, Beijing (which is surrounded by Hebei), neighboring Shanxi province — and Hong Kong that began in early January. Shanghai is home to China’s largest urban population of 24.28 million people. The city also serves as one of the world’s largest seaports, meaning the outbreak threatens to spread beyond the city.The two hospitals linked to Shanghai’s latest coronavirus outbreak “are well-known around China with patients from all across the country. Statistics from the cancer center’s official website show that its outpatient visits reached 1.57 million in 2019,” the Chinese state-run Global Times reported Thursday.Both Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center and Renji Hospital “have temporarily suspended their outpatient services, with inpatient services unaffected,” Shanghai Health Commission Director Wu Jinglei said at a Thursday press conference, according to Sixth Tone.“Patients requiring special medical attention will be transferred to separate facilities if needed,” Wu added.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinaChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthShanghai.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
580,"An increasing number of Pacific island nations are turning to the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Chinese government for financing, Reuters observed this weekend.The Cook Islands, Fiji, and Vanuatu have all accepted loans from either the AIIB or the Chinese government in recent months to help their ailing economies weather pandemic-induced hardship. The tiny island nations rely almost entirely on international tourism for revenue, an industry that has been effectively halted since early last year due to the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic.“Vanuatu, with a population of 300,000, … announced last week that it had accepted a US$12 million grant from the Chinese government,” Reuters reported on January 24.“The Cook Islands, a tiny country of around 20,000 people in the South Pacific, turned to … AIIB late last year after loans from the U.S. and Japanese-led Asian Development Bank (ADB) and [a] grant from close ally New Zealand fell short,” the news agency added, noting that this followed a few months after AIIB granted a similar first-time loan to Fiji last summer.“The … AIIB recently approved a USD 20-million financing to the Cook Islands—one of the world’s most tourism-driven economies—to provide social and economic assistance to the country to mitigate economic disruption and support economic resilience. The loan is AIIB’s first project in the Cook Islands and is funded by AIIB’s COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (CRF),” the AIIB announced on December 17.The AIIB is considered a rival to the ADB and the U.S.-led World Bank. It is closely linked to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), by which Beijing offers developing nations deceptively cheap loans from Chinese banks to finance infrastructure projects. The dubious deals often create a “debt trap” for already struggling nations thereby cementing their economic dependence on China.AIIB announced a $50 million loan approval to Fiji in late August for Chinese coronavirus-related work, the Fiji-based Islands Business news site reported at the time. The deal marked the first time Fiji had accessed AIIB’s loan facility since becoming a member of the multilateral development bank in 2017. AIIB confirmed that the loan was its first financing project in Fiji and in the Pacific region in general in an email to Islands Business.“AIIB is working to engage with the Pacific. We try to be attuned to the specific needs of the region. The Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic has taken a heavy toll on their economies, in particular on tourism. We will try to work with these members to help mitigate the negative impact,” senior AIIB Press Officer Alice Lo wrote.“As of August 13, 2020, AIIB’s Board of Directors has approved a total of 19 projects under the CRF [AIIB’s ‘COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility’], amounting to over USD 6.16 billion to support 15 members in navigating the challenges of these highly uncertain times. AIIB is reviewing additional projects from its clients,” the Beijing-backed bank said when announcing its loan to Fiji.Chinese leader Xi Jinping called on the AIIB to “grow into a new platform that promotes development for all its members and facilitates the building of a community with a shared future for mankind,” at the bank’s Board of Directors annual meeting on July 28.“Under the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, the AIIB needs to respond to adjustments and changes in the global economic landscape and engage more development partners in cooperation,” Xi said from Beijing at the virtual event.AsiaEconomyNational SecurityBeijingBelt and Road InitiativeBelt and Road Initiative (BRI)ChinaCook IslandsFijiPacificXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
581,"The Indian Army on Monday confirmed that “a minor face-off” between Indian and Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) border troops took place last week in the northeastern Indian state of Sikkim, which neighbors Tibet.“We have received several queries regarding a face-off between Indian Army and PLA troops in Sikkim sector. It is clarified that there was a minor face-off at Naku La area of North Sikkim on January 20 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols,” the Indian Army said in a statement released January 25.Multiple Indian media outlets reported on the incident on January 24, with some describing the conflict as a physical altercation that resulted in injuries on “both sides.”“There are reports of a fresh physical brawl having taken place between Indian and Chinese troops, this time at Naku La in Sikkim, thousands of kilometers away from the ongoing standoff at the Line of Actual Control [LAC] in eastern Ladakh,” India’s Times Now news site relayed on Sunday. The LAC is India’s official name for its unmarked Himalayan border with China.“The clash took place … when the troops of the [Chinese] People’s Liberation Army attempted to intrude inside Indian territory,” Times Now wrote. “The Indian Army troops foiled the intrusion bid and physical clashes ensued, in which soldiers from both sides were reported to be injured.”“Sources said no firearms were used during the clash. The situation is reported to be under control now,” the news site added.The Indian Army in its statement on Monday suggested that certain reports on the January 20 conflict may have been inaccurate.“The media is requested to refrain from overplaying or exaggerating reports which are factually incorrect,” an Indian Army spokesperson said on Monday, without referencing any specific details reported about the incident.“There have been minor frictions between the frontline forces of the two countries,” China’s state-run Global Times reported on Monday, acknowledging China’s January 20 face-off with India. The newspaper likewise dismissed Indian media reports alleging injuries sustained on both sides as “fake news.”The January 20 confrontation occurred four days before Indian and Chinese army commanders met in the northwestern Indian state of Ladakh to discuss solutions to their ongoing border standoff, which has remained unresolved since last May. The January 24 meeting marked the ninth round of official military talks to address the stalemate. The summit lasted nearly 16 hours, according to WION News, during which “the two sides held detailed deliberations on disengagement of troops from all friction points in eastern Ladakh.”New Delhi is expected to release further details of the dialogue to the public once the Indian Army commanders brief the Indian Prime Minister’s office about the meeting.China acknowledged on Monday that its PLA commanders met with their Indian Army counterparts on January 24 to discuss the border standoff.“I can confirm to you that a new round of talks was indeed held between China and India. Following our agreement, both sides will release the information as early as possible,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regularly scheduled press conference on January 25.Indian and Chinese border troops previously clashed in the Naku La area of North Sikkim on May 9, 2020, and on the intervening night of May 5 and 6, 2020. The two incidents caused “injuries to several soldiers on both sides,” the Hindu reported at the time, citing Indian Army sources.Indian and Chinese border regiments engaged in hand-to-hand combat in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 in a clash that killed 20 Indian soldiers and an estimated 40 Chinese troops. The incident was the deadliest border conflict between India and China in 45 years and sparked the ongoing standoff between the two Asian neighbors, though tensions between the two nations in the Himalayas had preceded the skirmish.AsiaNational SecuritybordersChinaHimalayasIndiapeople's liberation armyTibet.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
582,"A lawyer working for dissident Alexei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) claims Russian police forcibly removed him from the country, binding him with handcuffs and tossing a sack over his head before driving him across the border and handing him over to Belarusian authorities, Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty (RFERL) reported Tuesday.In a YouTube video, posted Monday, Uladzlen Los described the incident in detail, stating Russian police had barred him from entering Russia for five years and that Belarusian authorities declined to arrest him upon his repatriation. Los is a citizen of Belarus.The video is age-restricted and only available on YouTube, ostensibly to comply with the website’s “community guidelines.”It is a crime in Russia to incite minors to “illegal” political activity and the state’s censor, Roskomnadzor, has intensified its efforts to censor such content online, demanding on January 22 that TikTok drop videos encouraging protests for Navalny’s release.Uladzlen stated that police previously ordered him to leave the country by January 25. In the interim, the Belarusian lawyer received a three-day jail sentence for allegedly disobeying a police order. He, along with several other Navalny associates, entered police custody on various charges amid the large scale protests demanding Navalny’s release.Russian authorities arrested Navalny upon his arrival in the country after recuperating in Germany from an alleged assassination attempt involving the nerve agent Novichok, nearly synonymous with political assassinations, most notably the botched Kremlin hit on former intelligence operative Sergei Skripal.Navalny accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating the assassination attempt. Putin has adamantly denied any involvement. In December, Putin stated that, had he ordered his agents to kill Navalny, “they would have finished it.”While in custody, Navalny filmed a video urging his supporters to take the streets. Thousands responded to his call this weekend in several large Russian cities, including Moscow. The police crackdown escalated in response; authorities documented over 3,700 arrests at the protests, many of them over alleged violations of Russia’s anti-coronavirus social distancing measures.In a Tuesday press conference, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov discussed the protests and the unusually high number of arrests, blaming the developments on the protesters’ actions.“The level of violence among the participants of these actions was rather unprecedented. They behaved extremely aggressively,” Peskov said, according to state media outlet Tass.He then emphasized that the alleged protester violence “once again proves that the warnings regarding the danger of taking part in unsanctioned rallies are justified, as these aggressive so-called peaceful protesters are the ones provoking this violence, no one else.”AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAlexei NavalnyBelarus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
583,"China, a nation credibly accused of genocide of its ethnic minorities, used its state media apparatus on Monday to announce the collapse of American “values” at the hands of a growing pro-immigrant, “pluralistic” point of view.China has for decades treated its ethnic minorities and immigrants poorly. It is currently believed to be imprisoning as many as 2 million members of its Uyghur ethnic minority, and other Muslim members of groups like the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, in concentration camps in western Xinjiang province. Survivors say they are forced to abandon their Muslim faith, worship dictator Xi Jinping, and are subject to torture, rape, and forced sterilization, the latter a hallmark of genocide.Outside of Xinjiang, the Chinese Communist Party aroused global disgust last year with its extensive discrimination against African immigrants in Guangzhou, a regional capital that typically attracts many African transplants. At the height of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Chinese landlords began evicting black tenants, restaurants hung signs stating they would not serve black customers, and hotels rejected black people looking for a place to stay, resulting in the release of harrowing video of dozens of Africans sleeping on the streets of Guangzhou with nowhere to go.In this context, China’s People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, lamented that America had become too welcoming to other cultures and that this had destroyed its “values.”“The U.S. society has lost its values. With differing self and national identities, it is difficult to form a ‘spiritual synergy’ that unites the whole society to cope with challenges,” the author of the piece, professor Li Haidong, wrote. “The U.S., once a ‘melting pot’ of different immigrant groups and one that recognizes the dominance of white people and Christianity, is now filled with a pluralistic culture that emphasizes immigrants’ own language, religion, and customs.”Li wrote that the United States was catapulting into the status of a failed state because it treasured its tradition of teaching citizens to “value diversity and harmonious co-existence.” That motto, Li claimed, was creating “an increasingly sharp confrontation between values due to the split of different races.”Li disparaged former President Donald Trump as a supporter of “white supremacy” in the same article that he argued respect for immigrants was incompatible with social cohesion.“Trump, who advocates white supremacy and the dominance of Christianity, has constantly intensified conflicts between white people and other racial groups in areas of immigration and racial policies,” Li wrote, without offering any evidence. The author went on to argue that any attempt by President Joe Biden to impose the “pluralistic values” that Li claimed were dooming the country would “inevitably be blocked,” and that this was bad for the United States, although he blamed those values for the demise of the country in the same article.The Chinese Communist Party presides over a Han supremacist government that has increasingly moved to eradicate ethnic and linguistic minorities, imposing the northeast Han language, Mandarin, in regions where languages like Uyghur, Tibetan, and Mongolian are the norm. The Uyghur people have endured the most intense persecution of the state, relegated by the millions to concentration camps in their native Xinjiang region. Women who have escaped the camps, many of them not Uyghur but Kazakh or other ethnic minorities with ties to other states, have testified to being sterilized against their will, having their children killed, or enduring unwanted abortions.The Chinese government openly admits to reducing the Uyghur population by force – an act that fits the legal definition of genocide – and has boasted that the Party liberated Uyghur women from being “baby-making machines.” Among the acts mentioned in the legal definition of genocide is “imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.”In response to being accused of committing genocide against the Uyghur people, the Chinese government has claimed that “the U.S. is the country that commits the genocide of American Indians, discriminates against minority races, and severely violates workers’ human rights,” without addressing China’s own behavior.China also treats ethnic and racial minorities from outside its borders cruelly. In April 2020, at the height of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in southern China, African immigrants in southern Guangzhou began reporting of abrupt evictions, being banned from local businesses, and severe discrimination from authorities, including being put in “quarantine” even after testing negative for Chinese coronavirus. Some African residents were evicted, then denied entry to any hotel in the city despite having money to pay for a room, leaving many to sleep on the street – creating a hazardous situation for the spread of coronavirus.Some restaurants – most famously, the American chain McDonald’s – posted signs on their windows indicating they would not serve black customers, prompting international outrage.“We have pictures showing how some people were locked down in their apartments without food. You can’t go out on the street if you are black,” a spokeswoman for an association of Nigerians living in China protested at the time.Reports at the time indicated that Communist Party officials had told locals the coronavirus cases in the city had come from abroad, triggering discrimination against foreigners. But black residents of Guangzhou said they noticed only black people were being targeted for discrimination; non-black foreigners could live their lives in peace.A group of ambassadors in China from African countries wrote a letter to the Communist Party demanding “the cessation of forceful testing, quarantine and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans,” but Beijing did not appear to take any significant steps to reduce discrimination. The Global Times, a state propaganda outlet, blamed “cultural differences, different understanding of the pandemic, lack of knowledge about China’s policies, language barriers, and misleading hype by some Western media outlets” for the scandal, urging black people to “readjust their way of thinking.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter. AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaChinese Communist PartycommunismDonald TrumpGenocideImmigrantsJoe BidenracismUnited States.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
584,"Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro thanked the Communist Party of China on Monday for their “sensibility” towards Brazil, announcing that his government would import 5,400 liters of ingredients to make “Coronavac,” a Chinese coronavirus candidate by the Chinese firm Sinovac.The Chinese government would also send Brazil ingredients to produce the Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, Bolsonaro announced.The statement of appreciation from the Brazilian president came as something of a surprise after he spent the summer insisting to the Brazilian public that he would not allow any Chinese-made vaccine or vaccine candidate into the country, going so far as to cancel an order of Coronavac made by his health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, in October. Bolsonaro asserted that he had canceled the order – which Pazuello later clarified was not binding – because he did not want the Brazilian people to be “guinea pigs” for China.Sinovac had already been testing Coronavac on Brazilians for months through its partnership with the Instituto Butantan, which had come to an agreement with Sinovac to organize human trials. The Butantan testing revealed that Coronavac was only about 50 percent effective in preventing Chinese coronavirus cases, far below the success rate of approved vaccines from American pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna.Bolsonaro appears to have dropped his resistance to Coronavac after its dispiriting results were published.“The Chinese embassy informed us this morning that the export of 5,400 liters of ingredients for the Coronavac vaccine, [which was] already approved, is already on the way to [Brazil] [and] will arrive in the next few days,” Bolsonaro announced on Monday. “As well as the ingredients for the Astra-Zeneca vaccine which is being accelerated.”The announcement, made on Twitter, appears to indicate that Brazil will manufacture its own products with the guidance of the Chinese vaccine candidate developers.“I appreciate the sensibility of the Chinese government, as well as the effort of the ministers of [the Foreign Ministry], [Foreign Minister] Ernesto Araujo, [Health Minister] Eduardo Pazuello, and [Agriculture Minister] Tereza Cristina [Corrêa da Costa Dias],” Bolsonaro added.– Agradeço a sensibilidade do Governo chinês, bem como o empenho dos Ministros @ItamaratyGovBr @ernestofaraujo , @minsaude Eduardo Pazuello e @Mapa_Brasil @TerezaCrisMS .— Jair M. Bolsonaro (@jairbolsonaro) January 25, 2021Bolsonaro did not clarify the quantities of alleged ingredients for the AstraZeneca vaccine would arrive in Brazil from China. Reuters estimated that the amount of Coronavac ingredient stock would make for about 8.5 million doses of the vaccine candidate.Terça Livre, a conservative Brazilian outlet, noted that Bolsonaro also shared a photo of himself alongside Chinese dictator Xi Jinping in sharing his statement on Telegram.The Brazilian president, who has vocally stated that he will personally not take any Chinese coronavirus vaccine given that he has already overcome a coronavirus infection, said on Tuesday that the vaccine was indispensable to ensure that Brazil’s “economy does not stop working,” the Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported. Bolsonaro had previously promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial medication, instead of any forthcoming vaccines; no vaccine had been approved against the Chinese coronavirus at the time of Bolsonaro’s most vocal hydroxychloroquine advocacy.“Soon we will be among the top spots,” Bolsonaro said on Tuesday, referring to the percentage of the population vaccinated, “to give people more comfort [and] security for all and so that our economy does not stop working.”Bolsonaro emphasized during remarks Tuesday that the private sector had a role in purchasing and distributing vaccines.“Last week, we were approached by a representative of businessmen and we signed a letter of intent in favor of this, so that 33 million doses of the Oxford (vaccine) would come from the United Kingdom to Brazil, at no cost to the government,” Bolsonaro said. He claimed that the government would have access to about half of those doses and the businesses owned by the purchasers would distribute the other half among their employees.As recently as October, Bolsonaro overruled Pazuello and canceled the importing of 46 million doses of Coronavac.“The Brazilian people will not be anyone’s guinea pig,” he said, while human trials were underway at the Instituto Butantan. “My decision is to not purchase such a vaccine.”Bolsonaro has not publicly clarified his change in disposition, though the Coronavac doses he approved will be produced in Brazil, not in China.
Bolsonaro’s opposition to Coronavac inspired at least one major protest in Sao Paulo, where the Instituto Butantan is located and where the governor, Joao Doria, has promoted making coronavirus vaccines mandatory. Hundreds of Brazilians assembled in Sao Paulo in November holding up signs inspired by Bolsonaro, boasting slogans like “my body, my choice” and “I am not a guinea pig.”Bolsonaro campaigned against increased Chinese economic influence in Brazil in 2018 and has since claimed that free states have an “obligation” to fight communism, yet under Bolsonaro trade with China has greatly expanded. China is Brazil’s largest trade partner and has made headway in the Brazilian market following Bolsonaro’s visit to Beijing in October 2019. On that occasion, Bolsonaro met with Xi and signed eight trade agreements.“Brazil needs China, and China needs Brazil,” Bolsonaro said at the time, describing his nominally conservative administration and the genocidal communist dictatorship as “completely aligned, in a way that reaches beyond our commercial and business relationship.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter. AsiaLatin AmericaNational SecurityBrazilChinacommunismCoronavaccoronavirusJair BolsonaroSinovacvaccinesXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
585,"China is working to reinforce and build new border walls along its boundaries with Vietnam and Myanmar, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on Sunday.China is in the process of extending “a 4.5-meter-high iron fence, topped with barbed wire, along the Beilun River,” which runs along its border with Vietnam, the outlet noted. “Built between 2012 and 2017, the $29 million project … stretches 12 kilometers [7.5 miles] and is there to curb the smuggling of goods, drugs and people,” ABC wrote on January 24, citing a report by China’s state press agency Xinhua. Similarly, China reportedly completed construction of a 410-mile-long fence along a section of its border with Myanmar in December, according to ABC.China aims to extend the wall along the entire extent of its border with Myanmar (about 1,243 miles) by the end of 2021 as part of a “second phase” of the project, Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported on December 14. A third phase will be completed by October 2022 and will include the installation of “high-voltage power grids … on the [border’s] key smuggling sections. Skynet camera systems and infrared alarms will be installed in all places,” according to the report.China cited the spread of coronavirus into the country via illegal border crossings from Myanmar as a reason for its recent efforts to increase border controls with the country in late November. According to RFA’s December report on the Myanmar border wall, however, the Chinese government has reinforced the barrier, at least in part, “to prevent the exodus of its citizens to … Myanmar.” As for its border wall with Vietnam, China’s reinforcement of the barrier coincides with a recent upsurge in the number of Chinese migrant workers illegally crossing into Vietnam searching for work.Vietnam repatriated 29 illegal migrants from China in December, ABC noted on Sunday, citing local Vietnamese media.The Vietnam Public Security Border Bureau said last fall that it arrested “more than 100 stowaways from Guangxi, China, in the area near the Chinese border.”“The migrants had lost jobs in factories in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, and had been hoping to find work in Vietnam,” RFA reported on October 29, citing Vietnamese state media.“In one case, border patrols in the northern Vietnamese province of Lao Cai found 76 smuggled migrants from China, while a further 25 Chinese nationals were found by police in Ha Giang province,” the broadcaster revealed.“On October 20, video footage of around 1,000 Chinese migrant workers gathering near the border checkpoint in Guangxi, readying themselves to seek work in Vietnam, was posted to social media,” according to RFA.China’s Yunnan province borders Myanmar, Vietnam, and Laos.

586,"Communist-run media in North Korea — the only legal means of accessing information in the country — mentioned the fact that the United States has a new president for the first time in an article published Saturday, referring to President Joe Biden’s certification as the election winner in passing.The mention occurred in DPRK Today, a less visible government outlet than top newspaper Rodong Sinmun or the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), in reference to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, according to the South Korean news service Yonhap. No other North Korean news outlets have mentioned that Biden is the president of the United States at press time, meaning North Korean citizens have no legal means of knowing that information.During the presidency of Barack Obama, which saw more North Korean nuclear weapons tests than any other presidency, and during Biden’s presidential campaign, state media insulted Biden with particular vigor. One especially offensive column in KCNA, typically the closest North Korea has to a hard news service, in 2019 referred to Biden as a “rabid dog” and urged his killing “as quickly as possible” with a stick.“The U.S. Congress failed to declare Biden as the president on this day [January 6] and had to confirm Biden as the winner the following day,” Yonhap quoted DPRK Today as saying, detailing the events following the Capitol riot.“This marks the first time a North Korean media outlet has mentioned Biden’s victory since he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 7 (Washington time),” Yonhap noted. “North Korean media outlets had remained mum on the issue even when its closest ally Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of congratulations to Biden on Nov. 25.”The South Korean outlet noted that North Korea often takes days to announce a changing of the guard in Washington, and often in passing in articles about other topics. North Korea opened the year with its eighth-ever Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) Congress, which took up most of the attention of state media. The Party Congress is typically a chance for dictator Kim Jong-un to set the nation’s agenda for the next five years, promote or demote top officials as he wishes, and receive effusive praise for his alleged success as leader.January’s event was somewhat different in that Kim opened it by acknowledging his government’s failures.“Though the period of implementing the Five-Year Strategy for the National Economic Development ended last year, almost all sectors fell a long way short of the set objectives,” Kim said in his opening remarks. Kim nonetheless ended the Congress by declaring success and debuting what North Korean state media called the “world’s most powerful weapon” at a crowded parade in Pyongyang, which outside observers identified as a submarine-launched ballistic missile.North Korea has for years boasted of its illegal nuclear weapons program, claiming to have not just the active warheads but the missiles necessary to attack the United States. Kim typically refers to nuclear weapons in public remarks as a “war deterrent” and argues that they are necessary to prevent a full-scale assault of the country by America. North Korea and America — and China and South Korea, respectively — have technically been at war since 1950.North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, four of them under Obama. Pyongyang’s last nuclear test occurred in September 2017, leading to President Donald Trump imposing unprecedentedly strict sanctions on the country. Trump’s administration also convinced the United Nations, notably including top North Korean ally China, to approve sanctions through the Security Council. Kim has not tested a nuclear weapon since.Entering the White House, Biden and his diplomatic team have hinted at returning to Obama-era North Korea policies, which resulted in two-thirds of North Korea’s nuclear tests taking place during that time. South Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo noted on the eve of Biden’s inauguration that he had tapped several “seasoned Obama-era officials” to lead his diplomatic team, hinting at a reversal in policy. High atop the list is Wendy Sherman, a Clinton-era diplomat who Biden has reportedly sought to appoint deputy secretary of state. While Sherman’s chief policy failure was her role as lead negotiator in the talks that led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, Sherman also played a role in North Korea negotiations under President Bill Clinton.“The return of veteran Obama administration officials signals a distancing from Trump’s personal diplomatic approach to the North, reified in his two unprecedented summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,” JoongAng Ilbo noted.Trump focused on isolating Kim Jong-un from his regime in his diplomacy, meeting with Kim on multiple occasions and maintaining direct contact outside of communications between low-level officials. Trump became the first president in the history of the United States to meet a North Korean dictator in 2018, engaging in direct talks with Kim in Singapore. A second meeting occurred a year later, but Trump abruptly walked out, claiming Kim’s team was too intransigent about lifting sanctions without any significant reduction in nuclear development on Pyongyang’s party.Leftist South Korean President Moon Jae-in has encouraged Biden to follow Trump’s lead in the aftermath of the Singapore meeting, which resulted in a vaguely worded joint statement vowing further diplomacy from the two heads of state.“The inauguration of the new Biden administration could be the impetus for a fresh start for both North-U.S. and inter-Korean dialogue,” Moon said shortly before Biden’s inauguration, referring to the Singapore Declaration as “a very important declaration in terms of denuclearization and establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.”A significant obstacle to such talks may be North Korean state media’s distaste for Biden personally.“Rabid dogs like Baiden [sic] can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about. They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late,” KCNA suggested in 2019.“He is actually somewhat better than that,” Trump said of Biden in response to the attack.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsCapitol riotcommunismDonald TrumpJoe BidenKim Jong-unNorth KoreaSouth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
587,"Family members of jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong have sold their Hong Kong home and moved to Australia, the local newspaper Sing Tao Daily reported on Tuesday.The newspaper reported that Wong’s mother and younger brother “had left Hong Kong for Australia a few days ago.” Wong’s father allegedly sold the family’s apartment in the Hong Kong district of South Horizons at a price ten percent below market value, according to the report. Wong’s father refused to verify the developments when contacted by the Hong Kong newspaper.“The exodus, if confirmed, marks the highest-profile flight [from Hong Kong] of an activist’s family to date,” Coconuts Hong Kong noted on Tuesday.Hong Kong police arrested Wong, 24, on January 8 for allegedly violating the city’s national security law, which Beijing imposed on the formerly semi-autonomous city in May 2020 to quash a year-long pro-democracy protest movement. Wong was already in prison serving a 13.5-month sentence for his involvement in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protest movement over the past two years when he was “transferred from prison to a detention center” on January 8 and charged with “subverting state power,” Hong Kong police confirmed. Wong was sentenced to over a year in prison on December 2.Australia offered thousands of Hongkongers “safe haven visas,” or pathways to permanent residency, last summer in response to the city’s national security law, which stripped Hong Kong of its limited civil liberties. Wong told the Australian Financial Review in July 2020 that he welcomed the country’s offer.“Providing a lifeboat for Hong Kong people is a good move. When even countries that did not directly sign the Sino-British joint declaration provide assistance to Hong Kong people it shows how the Western world has no trust in Beijing,” Wong told the newspaper. The 1985 Sino-British joint declaration between Great Britain and China established the sovereign and administrative arrangement of Hong Kong upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997.Another Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, Lam Cheuk-ting, also sold his Hong Kong home at a price below market value last week, according to Sing Tao Daily‘s January 19 report. Lam told Sing Tao that he sold his home to free up funds for multiple lawsuits he is currently involved in — including one he filed against the Hong Kong police in 2019 over his alleged involvement in a mob attack on pro-democracy protesters earlier that year. Lam said he has no plans to leave Hong Kong, pointing out that authorities have seized his passport so that he cannot flee Hong Kong while he remains out on bail following his arrest late last month. Hong Kong police arrested Lam on December 28 for allegedly “disclosing the personal information of individuals being investigated by police” in connection with the July 2019 mob attack.AsiaNational SecurityAustraliaChinacommunismHong KongJoshua Wong.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
588,"Leftist South Korean President Moon Jae-in told reporters Monday that he hoped the administration of President-elect Joe Biden would continue the work President Donald Trump began in meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.Trump met with Kim twice — the first American head of state to meet a North Korean communist dictator — in Singapore in 2018 and in Hanoi, Vietnam, a year later. The first summit resulted in the signing of what is known as the “Singapore Declaration,” a joint statement in which both sides agreed to take unspecified measures to diffuse tensions. North Korea also agreed to return the remains of American soldiers killed during the active hostilities of the Korean War, which began in 1950 and technically continues today.The Hanoi summit ended abruptly as Trump walked out on Kim, claiming his negotiators were too intransigent on Pyongyang’s illegal nuclear weapons program.Moon has met with Kim on three occasions, all in 2018. In the last summit in September of that year, Moon visited Pyongyang, an unprecedented move, and received a personal tour of Mount Paektu, a volcano historically symbolic to the Korean people, from Kim himself.In his remarks Monday, Moon appeared to lament that Trump’s meetings with Kim had not continued and hoped Biden would return to Trump’s original policy, although North Korea has referred to the former vice president as a “rabid dog” who “must be beaten to death with a stick as quickly as possible.”“The inauguration of the new Biden administration could be the impetus for a fresh start for both North-U.S. and inter-Korean dialogue,” Moon told reporters, according to Korea’s JoongAng Ilbo. He referred specifically to the Singapore Declaration as “a very important declaration in terms of denuclearization and establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula” and reportedly hoped Biden would expand upon its signing.The Singapore Declaration, signed in June 2018, committed Trump and Kim to “establish new U.S. — DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the population of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.” It also required the parties to “join their efforts” to build a “peace regime” in Korea and required North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”The two parties never added any specific requirements to their general call for peace. The issue of denuclearization also stalled because North Korea insisted on defining “denuclearization” not as an end to North Korea’s illegal nuclear weapons program, but as the removal of the U.S. military presence in Korea entirely, as America is a nuclear power. Trump administration officials later admitted they had never managed to draft a mutually agreed-upon definition of “denuclearization.”North Korea has conducted six nuclear weapons tests. Four of them occurred under President Barack Obama — and Vice President Joe Biden — when Washington took a more conciliatory approach towards North Korea. The sixth and last nuclear weapons test occurred under Trump in 2017. The Trump administration managed to convince the U.N. Security Council, including North Korea’s top ally China, to impose unprecedentedly strict sanctions on North Korea, resulting in an end to the nuclear tests.In early January, at the opening of the congress of Kim Jong-un’s Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK), the dictator acknowledged that attempts at building North Korea’s economy in the past five years had been a catastrophic failure, resulting in the party falling short in “almost all sectors” of its goals.During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden falsely claimed that Trump had weakened sanctions on North Korea.During his remarks Monday, Moon also suggested that Biden should consider a proposal to formally end the Korean War. While no active hostilities have occurred since 1953, the warring parties — South Korea and America on one side, China and North Korea on the other — never signed a peace treaty and neither side surrendered.Moon also spoke glowingly of Biden, stating that he was “well-versed in inter-Korean affairs to the point where he has supported President Kim Dae-jung’s Sunshine Policy in the past.”South Korean President Kim (no relation) established the “Sunshine Policy,” which sought to develop friendly ties with North Korea despite the fact that the Koreas remain technically at war, during his tenure in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The result of the policy was several summits between Kim and then-North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s development of an illegal nuclear weapons program, and the South Korean taxpayer footing a bill of hundreds of millions of dollars to the North.“I believe our government holds in common various principles with the new Biden administration, such as multilateralism and alliance values, and that we are on the same wavelength in some aspects,” Moon said Monday.Moon has publicly supported Biden since his election and was the first world leader to speak to the president-elect after his win in November. The South Korean leader said at the time that he was seeking to meet Biden in person “at an early date after Biden’s inauguration,” his office said.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticscommunismDonald TrumpJoe BidenKim Jong-unMoon Jae-inNorth Koreanuclear weaponsSouth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
589,"Dozens of protesters demonstrated on Monday outside of a Moscow police station demanding the release of prominent Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, whom authorities arrested at a Moscow airport upon his return to the country and placed on trial for violating the terms of a suspended prison sentence.Navalny arrived in Russia on Monday and was promptly arrested by Russian authorities at the airport. He had previously announced a return to his home country. The Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) declared last week that Navalny would face arrest for violating the terms of his sentence by making known his permanent address to authorities.The FSIN previously warned Navalny to repatriate earlier, demanding in December that he do so or face his prison sentence, the suspension of which expired on December 30.Authorities reportedly established a “makeshift court” in the police station holding Navalny. The court agreed to allow prosecutors to hold Navalny in custody for nearly one month. Navalny defense attorney Vadim Kobzev told state media outlet Tass that “The Khimki Court ruled that Navalny is under arrest until February 15.”Navalny’s supporters demonstrated outside of the station in what was reportedly weather of -4 degrees Fahrenheit, demanding his immediate release. The protesters reportedly engaged in solo picketing, an increasingly common form of protest designed to circumvent the tough penalties on mass demonstrations, the BBC reported. The outlet described the protesters as “mostly students, young professionals and NGO activists.”In a video filmed inside the station and posted to social media, Navalny urged his supporters to take the streets. “Do not be silent. Resist. Take to the streets. No one but ourselves will protect us, and there are so many of us that if we want to achieve something, we will achieve it,” he said. In a second video, he labeled the proceedings inside the police station as a “mockery of justice.”The Russian dissident’s return to the country came after spending several months in Germany recuperating from an alleged poisoning attempt involving the deadly nerve agent Novichok, infamous for its use in political assassinations, most notably the botched Kremlin hit on former intelligence operative Sergei Skripal.The details around the alleged assassination attempt remain unclear. Navalny has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering his death, which Putin has denied. In December, he stated that, had he told his agents to kill him, “they would have finished it.”The Russian government has attacked Navalny through the legal system in the past. In 2018, the Russian Supreme Court affirmed a fraud conviction against him and his brother, Oleg, backing a 2014 court ruling that the pair laundered $500,000 from French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. The brothers received three-and-a-half-year prison sentences, but the more prominent Navalny received a suspension which expired December 30, 2020.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) weighed in on the case multiple times, making favorable rulings for Navalny, though the external body could not ease Navalny’s legal woes, with his prison sentence lingering as a pretense for his arrest.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsAlexei NavalnyVladimir Putin.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
590,"The government of Pakistan recently threatened two American Muslims with prison sentences of up to ten years if they did not take down a U.S.-based “blasphemous” website — a threat one of those targeted told Breitbart News on Tuesday represented “an unprecedented and entirely new frontier of digital policing that Pakistan is trying to impose.”The website in question — TrueIslam.com — is the online home of the American Ahmadiyya Muslim community, run by an American group, hosted in the United States, and represented by American citizens. Ahmadi Muslims differ from Sunni and Shia Muslims in believing that the promised Messiah of Islam arrived on earth in the form of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was born in India in 1835. The Ahmadiyya consider their current leader, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the “Present Khalifa of Islam.” Ahmadi Muslims emphasize in their worship “commitment to peace, their law-abiding nature and determination to create a harmonious society for all people, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity or faith,” TrueIslam.com details.The attempt to silence “blasphemy” in America follows repeated vows from Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan that he would endeavor to criminalize speech that offends Muslims globally, including using Pakistan’s platform on the U.N. Human Rights Council to enact global laws to silence enemies of Khan’s interpretation of Sunni Islam anywhere on the planet. The U.N. General Assembly approved a resolution introduced by Pakistan in December against alleged “Islamophobia” calling for the silencing of speech offensive to Muslims.Blasphemy against Islam is a crime in the Pakistani penal code. Blasphemy against Mohammed, the prophet of Islam, or the Quran in particular, is punishable by death.Despite the Khan government’s aggressive protests against “Islamophobia,” Pakistani law explicitly practices Islamophobia against Ahmadi Muslims. The Sunni government considers the community “imposters.” Pakistani citizens are forced to renounce Ahmadi Islam publicly for legal documents such as passports. It is illegal for Ahmadis to identify as Muslim in any way, and protections for Muslims in Pakistan’s Islamic legal code do not apply to them.The Pakistan Telecommunication Authorities (PTA), the nation’s government media watchdog, sent a message to Ahmadiyya Muslim Community USA’s spokesmen, Amjad Mahmood Khan and Harris Zafar, last week demanding they unpublish TrueIslam.com or face criminal prosecution in Pakistan. The message accused the American citizens of violating Pakistan’s blasphemy law, which prohibits Ahmadis from identifying as Muslim, and threatened over $3 million in fines and a prison sentence of up to ten years for each if they did not take it down. As all individuals involved are Americans and the alleged infractions did not occur in Pakistan, the move represents an attempt to enforce Pakistani law on American soil.“This is an unprecedented and entirely new frontier of digital policing that Pakistan is trying to impose across international boundaries,” Harris Zakar, national spokesman for the American Ahmadiyya Muslim community and one of the two Americans threatened in the PTA missive, told Breitbart News. “This overreaching censorship effort seeking to criminalize online speech speaks volumes to how far Pakistan’s authoritarian government is willing to go to target and persecute a religious community that it has persecuted for decades.”Zakar described the attempt to enforce Pakistani law as “clearly frivolous” but warned that, despite the fact that “there is no direct personal consequence for Amjad and myself other than the fact that this impedes our ability to travel to Pakistan … if this attempt by Pakistan is not confronted, then it does set a dangerous precedent of what kind of digital policing will be allowed from an authoritarian government.”Zakar also rejected the accusation that Ahmadiyya Islam, and the website for American Ahmadis, is somehow blasphemous against Islam.“Of course it is absurd to allege that a community of devout Muslims who adhere to 100% of the Quran and the teachings from the life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) can be in any way blasphemous,” Zakar said. “Ahmadi Muslims cherish, love, and honor Islam with their adherance to its true and authentic teachings, which completely disagrees with the hardline and extremist mindset that has caused so much trouble in the Muslim world.”“The specific website Pakistan seeks to ban — TrueIslam.com — encapsulates the wonderful work a faithful group of American Muslims does to live up to the ideals of Islam,” he explained, “highlighting: our work for racial justice, our work to continue to honor the lives lost on 9/11, to always call for a separation of religion and state, the 9 fundamental principles to achieving world peace, etc.”The PTA targeted the American Ahmadiyya community shortly after a vague attempt to threaten Wikipedia and Google out of hosting content about the existence of Ahmadi Muslims. In December, the Pakistani government agency published letters it claimed were sent to representatives of both companies ordering them to unpublish “deceitful information,” by which it meant content on Ahmadi Muslims. Neither company has removed the content in question at press time.Pakistan has for decades been an inhospitable environment, at best, for religious minorities, particularly Ahmadi Muslims and Christians. Under Prime Minister Khan, however, attacks on minorities have increased significantly, in part emboldened by Khan’s vow to turn the silencing of speech he considers “blasphemy” to the international stage.“Pakistan will spearhead a campaign for an international declaration against the defamation of religions,” Khan promised in 2018. The campaign, he detailed, would “prevent people using freedom of speech as a cover for hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims around the world. Pakistan will spearhead the signing of this convention and make using freedom of speech to commit blasphemy a crime.”During his 2020 U.N. General Assembly speech, Khan condemned European countries for allowing citizens to express themselves freely, specifically noting the existence of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, which has suffered violent jihadist attacks over its cartoons of Mohammed.“Muslims continue to be targeted with impunity in many countries … incidents in Europe, including republication of blasphemous sketches by Charlie Hebdo, are recent examples,” Khan said. “We stress that willful provocations and incitement to hate and violence must be universally outlawed.”“Blasphemy in the garb of freedom of expression is intolerable,” Khan repeated in November.According to the international advocacy group Human Rights Watch, 2020 was an especially violent year for Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan.“Since July 2020, there have been at least five apparently targeted killings of members of the Ahmadiyya community. In only two of the cases have the police taken a suspect into custody,” the organization noted. “Pakistani authorities have long downplayed, and at times even encouraged, violence against Ahmadis, whose rights to freedom of religion and belief are not respected under Pakistani law.”In July of that year, a Pakistani court allowed an assassin to kill an Ahmadi American citizen, Tahir Naseem, before a judge during a trial in which he was accused of “blasphemy” for being Ahmadi. The killer mentioned Naseem’s faith as the reason he chose to kill him.AsiaFaithNational SecurityAhmadi MuslimsAhmadiyya MuslimImran KhanIslamPakistanradical islam.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
591,"Monthly suicide rates in Japan increased by 16 percent from July to October 2020 compared to the same period the previous year, Japanese researchers have found. The three-month interval coincided with Japan’s second wave of Chinese coronavirus outbreaks, Reuters reported Sunday.Published by researchers at Tokyo’s Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology and Hong Kong University in the scientific journal Nature Human Behavior on January 15, the study found a larger increase in the suicide rates “among females (37 percent) and children and adolescents (49 percent).”Friday’s findings contrast starkly with suicide data from Japan’s first coronavirus wave – February to June 2020 – when the country recorded a 14 percent decline in the number of suicides nationwide. Some observers credited the drop to increased government subsidies during periods of lockdown, as well as decreased working hours and school closures. Japanese researchers suggested that the conditions may have reduced daily stress for the nation’s traditionally overworked citizens.Scientists based the January 15 suicide study on Japanese health ministry data from November 2016 to October 2020.“Unlike normal economic circumstances, this pandemic disproportionately affects the psychological health of children, adolescents and females (especially housewives),” the study’s authors wrote.The 37-percent increase in female suicides was “about five times the increase among men – as the prolonged pandemic hurt industries where women predominate, increasing the burden on working mothers, while domestic violence increased,” the researchers noted.Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide on January 7 declared a limited state of emergency for Tokyo and three of its surrounding prefectures after health authorities recorded a surge in the number of new daily coronavirus cases throughout the capital region. Suga expanded the state of emergency to seven additional prefectures, including Osaka and Kyoto, on January 13. The lockdown restrictions in the national capital are slated to last until at least February 7 and will shut down or restrict service across greater Tokyo’s 150,000 restaurants and bars.Japan’s administrative and regulatory reform minister, Kono Taro, told Reuters on January 14 that the Japanese federal government “cannot kill the economy” in its efforts to contain Japan’s latest coronavirus resurgence, as this may have a destructive impact on the nation’s collective mental health.“People worry about COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus]. But a lot of people have also committed suicide because they have lost their jobs, they have lost their income and couldn’t see the hope,” Kono told the news agency.“We need to strike the balance between managing COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] and managing the economy,” he added.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthJapanmental healthsuicide.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
592,"A Taiwanese lawmaker has called for an official probe into the sale of Chinese-made karaoke machines sold in Taiwan that play Chinese “propaganda songs,” the Taipei Times reported on Tuesday.Legislator Chen Ting-fei said on Monday “she was approached by a person who had discovered Chinese patriotic songs such as My Motherland — which is commonly referred to as China’s ‘second national anthem’ — in Chinese-made karaoke devices sold in Taiwan,” according to the newspaper.“The machines are popular, as they can connect to the Internet, providing access to thousands of songs,” Chen, a member of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said.The Chinese-made devices often contain songs sung by members of China’s military, or by members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), a Taiwanese retailer told the Taipei Times. The songs may be accompanied by music videos depicting China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers and military weapons.“Most of these devices come equipped with off-the-shelf boxes that connect to servers in China, which is where they get their content,” Chen explained, adding that the CCP could theoretically stream anything it wants through the machines.Beijing plants “pro-unification” songs on the karaoke machines as part of its “united front” tactics, Chen said. She referred to China’s official stance toward Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade territory. Taiwan is a sovereign state with its own constitution, government, and military. Despite this, the CCP has vowed to take the island, located off China’s southeastern coast, by force, if necessary.Chen said on January 18 that she had arranged a meeting with members of Taiwan’s National Communications Commission and the Taiwanese Ministry of Economic Affairs for the end of the month to further discuss the karaoke machine matter.“[Taiwan’s] Mainland Affairs Council also expressed concern over the content on the Chinese-made karaoke machines, saying that they breached the rights of Taiwanese artists, whose work is often used on the devices without their permission,” the Taipei Times noted on Monday. “The council said it had already filed a lawsuit against Taiwanese companies selling the devices in August last year, and had also met with the commission and the ministry to discuss the issue.”Seven brands sell Chinese-made karaoke machines in Taiwan. Domestic Taiwanese companies selling karaoke devices on the island must obtain copyright permission for the songs they wish to play. Home units typically require up to 20,000 copyright requests, while commercial units often call for up to 30,000.“The Chinese Internet-connected devices break Taiwan’s copyright laws, which is why they can claim to have more than 700,000 songs on them, and why companies selling or publicly using them often face lawsuits,” a Taiwanese karaoke machine retailer told the Taipei Times.U.S. Customs officials in the state of Virginia last month seized nearly 5,000 fake karaoke machines from China as they headed to consumers who purchased the devices through Amazon. “Federal officials said the fake machines were seized with the help of online retailers who suspected they were counterfeit,” the Associated Press reported on December 16.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaKaraokeTaiwan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

594,"China has shut down at least 11 regions as of Monday and is facing major coronavirus outbreaks throughout the country, two weeks after the nation hosted a New Year’s Eve party for a crowd of thousands in Wuhan.Wuhan, the capital of central Hubei province where the Chinese coronavirus originated in late 2019, held an open-air New Year’s Eve celebration which thousands attended on December 31 to greet 2021. Chinese state media boasted that those expressing concern about the dramatic images of tightly-packed crowds should “get used to it,” as Wuhan would continue to host large parties and other gatherings.Public health experts have regularly discouraged mass gatherings in light of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, noting they help bolster community spread of the virus. Experts also recommend that those potentially exposed to the virus quarantine for 14 days, the believed maximum incubation period for the virus to show itself via symptoms.The Global Times, a Chinese government newspaper, announced Monday that the Communist Party had shut down movement in at least 11 regions in three provinces — northeastern Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Hebei — insisting that the restrictions were not “lockdowns,” but “de facto” lockdowns. Residents cannot leave those areas and their movement within is strictly limited.The capital of Hebei, Shijiazhuang, is reportedly the most active hotspot, where medical experts had documented 745 coronavirus cases as of Monday, all of them transmitted locally. Authorities there announced last Friday that they would begin building a new quarantine facility with the ability to house 3,000 patients, allegedly in anticipation of high levels of travel — and contagion — during next month’s Lunar New Year holiday.Last year, Wuhan allowed 5 million of its 11 million residents to leave the city during Lunar New Year, effectively spreading the Chinese coronavirus worldwide.Hebei province surrounds the capital region of Beijing.In addition to the three provinces on lockdown, a fourth, Shanxi, banned rural residents from organizing funerals, weddings, and performances last week, and also imposed “strict controls” on the gatherings it would allow. Liaoning, north of Jilin, has also documented a surge. Hong Kong, about 1,600 miles from Jilin, is experiencing a coronavirus case boom that health officials there blamed on ethnic minorities.“They have many family gatherings and like to gather with fellow countrymen. They like to share food, smoke, drink alcohol, and chat together,” Raymond Ho, head of the Centre for Health Protection’s health promotion branch, claimed Monday.In northeast China, officials have targeted two main alleged causes of the outbreaks: one individual who officials claim is a “superspreader,” and frozen food, which scientists doubt has the ability to spread coronavirus.Communist Party media identified the “superspreader” only by the last name “Lin” and claimed he is a “silent,” or asymptomatic, carrier of the Chinese coronavirus. Lin is allegedly from Heilongjiang and brought the outbreak to Jilin while touring clubs of elderly people to promote the sale of linseed oil, a common product in traditional Chinese medicine. The Global Times claimed that the incident shows that asymptomatic cases “could pose an even more dangerous threat for local epidemic control and prevention than those confirmed cases” — speculation unfounded in scientific data. Officials at the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) said in June that asymptomatic spread is “very rare,” then clarified, “we don’t actually have that answer yet.”In the same article, the Global Times later states, “silent infections are less contagious and possess a lower viral load than confirmed cases.”Another culprit identified by the Communist Party is “frozen products,” which they claim come from foreign countries and bring the virus living on their surfaces. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there is “no evidence” linking frozen food packaging to coronavirus spread.Absent from the theories as to what caused China’s most recent outbreak is a party for thousands of tightly-packed people in Wuhan, which followed weeks of what Australia’s The News described as images “showing bars, restaurants and clubs thriving in Wuhan, with no evidence in the city of 11 million residents that the world was currently gripped by a pandemic.” Many of those interviewed attending the event were not Wuhan locals, with some even admitting it was their first time in the city. Presumably, these individuals went home after their attendance at the party.Public experts have routinely and effusively discouraged mass gatherings due to their ability to rapidly spread disease.“In the context of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], mass gatherings are events that could amplify the transmission of the virus and potentially disrupt the host country’s response capacity,” the W.H.O.’s guidelines on mass gatherings read.The head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci, has repeatedly warned Americans to stay home and as far away from other people as possible, going so far as to personally abstain from celebrations for Thanksgiving and Christmas.“More big gatherings like the New Year celebrations, sports events and live concerts will be staged in Wuhan, which was the hardest-hit city in China by COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], during 2021, and the world had better get used to it,” the Global Times asserted on January 3, calling criticism of the mass gatherings “prejudice and hostility.”“When large crowds of Wuhan residents took to streets and launched balloons to celebrate the arrival of 2021 on New Year’s Eve, in sharp contrast with what Western media called a ghost town like Times Square with roads closed but no live audience, some Westerners with jealous eyes were sarcastic about Wuhan,” the Times observed. “Some Wuhan residents reached by the Global Times called the sarcastic comments ‘sour grapes,’ and said that their lives had returned to normal months ago, and more gatherings like the New Year celebration would be held in the city.”AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacommunismcoronavirusNew Years EveWorld Health OrganizationWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
595,"Russian state media monitor Roskomnadzor is pressuring social media outlets, especially TikTok, to restrict online content in support of protests following the arrest of prominent dissident Alexei Navalny, the Moscow Times reported Thursday.TikTok, in particular, has seen an explosion of young Russians posting videos calling for mass protests over Navalny’s arrest. It is a crime in Russia to incite minors to attend “illegal” gatherings, the restrictions on which have become even tougher due to the coronavirus pandemic, Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty (RFERL) noted.In a Wednesday statement, Roskomnadzor announced it had requested that TikTok delete the video content that violates Russian law. The statement, which appeared on Russian social media network VKontakte, outlined the request:“Materials are being spread via TikTok, calling young users of the social network to take part in illegal mass protest events,” it said. “We request that you immediately take comprehensive measures to prevent the distribution of such unlawful information on the TikTok platform.”Videos promoting the mass protests, scheduled for this Saturday, have reportedly amassed over 200 million cumulative views.Apart from efforts at censorship, the Russian state has attempted to discourage protesting through other means. Russian police announced they would seek prosecution of individuals calling people to protest on Thursday, according to Interfax. School teachers and administrators have also reportedly threatened to expel any students caught at the Saturday protests.
Federal authorities arrested Navalny upon his return to the country after spending several months in Germany recuperating from an alleged poisoning attempt involving the deadly nerve agent Novichok, infamous for its use in political assassinations, most notably the botched Kremlin hit on former intelligence operative Sergei Skripal. There is no significant record of the use of Novichok by any actors without ties to the Russian or former Soviet state.Navalny has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering his death, which Putin has denied. In December, he stated that, had he told his agents to kill him, “they would have finished it.”After Navalny’s arrest, supporters gathered outside of the police station, where he faced a makeshift court and questionable legal proceedings likely designed to ensure he remain in custody, to demand his release.In a video filmed inside the station, Navalny urged his supporters to take the streets.“Do not be silent. Resist. Take to the streets. No one but ourselves will protect us, and there are so many of us that if we want to achieve something, we will achieve it,” he said.AsiaNational SecurityTechAlexei NavalnyRussiaTikTok.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
596,"Chinese government media effusively celebrated the departure of outgoing President Donald Trump on Wednesday, describing the anti-communist leader as “negative and destructive” and exclaiming, “good riddance!”The latter arrived via a post on Twitter from the Xinhua news agency, the Chinese Communist Party’s typically drier “hard news” outlet. While the Communist Party bans Chinese citizens from using American social media networks like Twitter, the government’s propagandists have full access to the outlet and regularly use it to post stories favorable to China.The Xinhua post celebrating Trump’s departure was accompanied by a graphic and a link to a Xinhua article published last week that predicted, “the anti-China policy of the current U.S. administration will only end in failure.”Good Riddance, Donald Trump! https://t.co/kYNQ0jTCfH pic.twitter.com/UoDm8RIT6V— China Xinhua News (@XHNews) January 20, 2021The Xinhua article also declared Trump and those who shared his opposition to the Communist Party “weak on the inside” and declared China’s “strength and determination” would secure it a victory in its quest for hegemony — a quest the Foreign Ministry regularly denies exists.As president, Trump made opposition to the Communist Party’s myriad human rights atrocities, its attempts to colonize impoverished states in Latin America and Africa, and its promotion of authoritarianism at international venues like the United Nations the cornerstone of his foreign policy. Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods to weaken the Communist Party’s stranglehold on manufacturing, enhanced ties with states that China targeted under its “Belt and Road” debt trap plan, and withdrew from the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) in response to its poor handling of the Chinese coronavirus, fueled by its close ties to the Communist Party. On his last day in office, Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared that the genocide of Muslims in western China, millions of which have been trapped in concentration camps for years, was a “genocide.”The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to Pompeo by calling him a “clown” on Wednesday and claiming the genocide of Uyghurs and other Muslims in western Xinjiang province was “a conspiracy of evil politicians like Pompeo” and not reality.As a result of Trump’s policies, China’s influence has waned significantly in the past four years and campaigns to defend the Uyghur Muslim people of western China have gained traction. Trump’s policies have also limited the rogue activity of Chinese allies like Iran, Venezuela, North Korea, and Cuba. In contrast, as a candidate, President-elect Joe Biden suggested that he would be less aggressive in combatting Communist Party influence, opting to “gather the rest of the world” rather than unilaterally act to contain Chinese influence.Chinese state media have cautiously expressed hope Biden would return to the Obama-era “status quo” of policies towards China, which allowed the Communist Party to engage in extensive intellectual property theft, espionage, and other concerning behavior.The Global Times, China’s more aggressive opinion propaganda publication, published two articles consolidating alleged responses from Chinese “netizens” to prompts about Trump on Weibo, a Chinese social media outlet. The Communist Party strictly monitors speech on Weibo, WeChat, and other Chinese social media networks to prevent any opinions that differ with that of the Party from appearing online. Given this reality, the Global Times found that Weibo users had reached an “overwhelming consensus … of negativity and mockery” towards Trump.“The most common words and phrases mentioned under the Global Times posts include destruction, dishonest, selfish, populism, McCarthyism, unilateralism, protectionism, anti-globalization, untrustworthy, messy, crazy, arrogant,” the newspaper claimed, “uncertainty, low-credit, funny, laughable, gravedigger of US hegemony, and enemy to pro-US sycophants.”The Global Times also claimed that some Chinese believed Trump to be secretly a Communist Party agent attempting to destroy the United States and referred to him as “Comrade Jianguo,” meaning “build the country.”The Global Times‘ stable of Party-approved “experts” also disparaged Trump, claiming that the president had “brought unprecedented destruction to the legal legitimacy and moral legitimacy of the U.S.” Paramount among Trump’s listed sins is heralding in an era of “grievous levels of individualism” in America.China Daily, another Communist Party newspaper, accused President Trump of a “coup attempt” after the January 6 riot in the U.S. Capitol and accused him of destroying the “foundations of [America’s] democracy.”“What awaits the members of the outgoing administration after all the power plays they engaged in over the past four years will be humbling. But they will not be missed and will receive little sympathy given their inability to pause and reflect on their ideological rigidity and its consequences,” China Daily gloated.Trump departed the White House early Wednesday morning after delivering remarks thanking his supporters for the privilege of serving in the presidency.“I wish the new administration great love and great success. I think they’ll have great success. They have the foundation to something really spectacular,” Trump said in his speech, promising supporters, “we’ll be back in some form.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinacommunismDonald TrumpGlobal TimesJoe BidenXinhua.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Bolton; and White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon.China’s foreign ministry accused the sanctioned individuals of promoting “anti-China” policies over the past four years while serving in Trump’s administration. President Trump’s term in office officially ended January 20 at noon, moments before China announced the sanctions on his policy advisors.“Over the past few years, some anti-China politicians in the United States, out of their selfish political interests and prejudice and hatred against China and showing no regard for the interests of the Chinese and American people, have planned, promoted and executed a series of crazy moves which have gravely interfered in China’s internal affairs, undermined China’s interests, offended the Chinese people, and seriously disrupted China-U.S. relations,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs alleged in its statement Wednesday.“The Chinese government is firmly resolved to defend China’s national sovereignty, security and development interests,” the ministry added.Iran joined China in announcing sanctions against members of the Trump administration Wednesday, including President Donald Trump himself, for allegedly promoting terrorism.Iran is the world’s premier state sponsor of terrorism.“The Iranian Foreign Ministry added a number of American individuals to its sanctions list for committing terrorist crimes, promoting and supporting terrorism, which is a serious threat to regional and international peace and security, and for violating basic rules and fundamental principles of international law, including human rights,” Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement.Tehran sanctioned many of the same U.S. officials whom China targeted on Wednesday, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with the addition of President Trump.“The US officials have been blacklisted for their full support for the Israeli regime’s acts of aggression against the Palestinian people, particularly the regime’s terrorist move in assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh,” Khatibzadeh said, referring to Iran’s claim that Israel assassinated Fakhrizadeh via remote-controlled weapon in November.President Trump’s administration repeatedly sanctioned Iranian government and military officials for supporting “terrorist entities.”AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsChinaDonald TrumpMike PompeoU.S..Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
598,"China’s state-run propaganda outlet Global Times concluded in an opinion column Sunday that the vast majority of Americans assume their state will soon collapse.The article, citing the alleged results of a poll from the Washington rumor publication Axios, referred to America as a “third world failed state” where citizens live in “distress, fear, and horror,” citing tensions prior to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.The article follows weeks of an unprecedented resurgence of the Chinese coronavirus within its native country that has resulted in extensive lockdowns throughout the vast country, from the greater Beijing area to the city where the virus originated, Hubei province capital Wuhan. In articles placed significantly below the column predicting the complete demise of the United States, the Global Times admitted that 11 regions across China are under lockdown and that coronavirus testing experts in Hebei, the province surrounding Beijing, had falsified documentation to fabricate fake negative coronavirus tests.In the aftermath of a riot in the U.S. Capitol building by individuals alleged to support President Donald Trump, the Global Times and other Chinese Communist Party outlets have repeatedly claimed the United States has lost all moral authority as the world’s leading democracy.“The U.S. is falling apart — this is not an alarmist statement made by external observers with prejudice toward the U.S. or ulterior motives to badmouth the country, but the opinion of a majority of the Americans,” the Global Times declared Sunday. Citing, but not linking to, the alleged Axios poll, the article claimed as many as 80 percent of Americans believe the nation “is falling apart.”“Some regard the U.S. as ‘a third world failed state,'” the Global Times declared. “The country that they used to believe was omnipotent has in fact made them fall into distress, fear and horror.”The article went on to call America “a laughing stock [sic] in the international arena.” The column claimed political divisions in the country are “unprecedented” even while noting that, less than 200 years ago, Americans went to war with each other.The Global Times concluded in the piece, as its articles often do, that the lesson to take from Americans’ uncertainty is that China will soon be the world’s dominant power.“In the past few decades, Americans have been playing up the ‘China collapse’ theory. Now, China is believed to lead the global recovery from the pandemic while the U.S. has been mired in crises that many are worrying may lead the country to collapse,” the Times claimed. “Perhaps we should ask scholars who once hyped the ‘China threat’ theory, such as Gordon Chang: Is the U.S. the one falling apart? Is the U.S. collapse theory a subject more worthy of scholars to study?”Prior to the November 2020 presidential election, Chinese media declared that the world had lost its taste for democracy given the “fragile” state of America, which publications like the Global Times blamed on the fact that Americans can express political disagreements freely, causing “division.” The Global Times has explicitly campaigned against the use of elections to reflect the political will of a nation’s people, arguing they cannot “reflect the true essence of democracy.”Chinese media has also referred to America as a “primitive society” and democratic governance as an “outdated fantasy.”China is a totalitarian communist state that has criminalized any dissent from the opinions of the ruling party for generations. Individuals publicly contradicting the government — even on non-political issues like public health — face police persecution and accusations of the crime of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble.”The prediction of demise for America follows a particularly embarrassing week for the Chinese government following the publication of the dismal results of studies on “CoronaVac,” the coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac. Scientists testing the vaccine candidate in Brazil initially claimed that CoronaVac was 78-percent effective in combatting the Chinese coronavirus, significantly less effective than approved vaccines from American companies Pfizer and Moderna. A week later, Brazilian officials revealed that the true effectiveness rating of CoronaVac was only 50.38 percent.The Global Times declared the vaccine “good enough” and began publishing screeds calling for global health authorities to ban the Pfizer vaccine, which is 95-percent effective.Just as the lackluster news on its vaccine candidate offering surfaced, the Chinese government began admitting to growing numbers of cases of coronavirus nationwide, with the most prominent outbreak currently in Hebei province.“As the novel coronavirus sees a resurgence in China, at least 11 regions in three provinces adopted de facto lockdown measures and rolled out massive free nucleic acid tests among populations to curb the spread of the virus,” the Global Times admitted on Sunday, noting that the Communist Party began imposing onerous lockdowns on its citizens but, unlike this time last year, refused to call them “lockdowns.” Many of the most vulnerable regions are in the nation’s northeast, posing a threat to bordering nations Russia and North Korea.In northeast Hebei, authorities admitted Monday that alleged “third-party agencies” working to test citizens in the province had falsified negative tests for individuals who had not receiving any coronavirus test yet, resulting in a province-wide “rescreening” of all testing results.A study published by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in April found that China had under-reported its coronavirus case count by nearly 3 million cases, meaning it had over 100 times more coronavirus cases than it had reported to the world, dramatically hurting international efforts to contain what by then had become a pandemic.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityPoliticsBeijingCapitol riotChinacommunismcoronavirusGlobal TimesU.S. CapitolWuhan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
599,"Government officials in China have sealed off at least 11 regions across three provinces to curb the spread of a Chinese coronavirus “resurgence,” state media reported on Monday.“Northeast China’s Heilongjiang sealed off at least five regions – Zhaodong, Qinggang, Suihua city’s downtown area, Angangxi district in Qiqihar and Hulan district in Harbin. Local residents are required to stay in their homes and vehicles are prohibited on roads. Exit and entry roads are also closed off,” according to the Chinese Communist Party newspaper Global Times. “The cities of Gongzhuling and Tonghua in Northeast China’s Jilin are also in de facto lockdowns.”“[F]our regions in North China’s Hebei Province have also been sealed off – Longyao county, Gu’an county, Nangong and the provincial capital Shijiazhuang,” the newspaper added.Although local governments did not describe the restrictions on movement explicitly as “lockdowns,” the affected regions are “adopting measures similar to lockdowns, which usually mean residents are asked not to go out, vehicles are prohibited on roads and routes into the region are strictly controlled,” the Global Times noted.Provincial health authorities are carrying out mass testing for the Chinese coronavirus in the locked-down areas, as well as other towns. Health officials in the northeastern city of Jilin reported “34 confirmed cases and 80 asymptomatic patients” of the Chinese coronavirus as of Monday, according to the newspaper. The northern province of Hebei, which surrounds the national capital, Beijing, “reported a total of 54 confirmed and six asymptomatic cases” on January 18. “Heilongjiang reported seven confirmed and 81 asymptomatic cases,” as of the same date.“Since Jan. 2, Shijiazhuang has registered 745 locally-transmitted confirmed COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] cases, including one death, and 12 of them have been discharged from hospital after recovery,” China’s state-run press agency, Xinhua, reported on January 18. Shijiazhuang is the capital of Hebei province and was one of the first municipal regions to report a new surge in coronavirus cases this month. Government authorities “sealed off” Shijiazhuang and its surrounding villages starting January 5.News of the widespread lockdowns and testing across China comes amid reports that the federal government is scrambling to build new hospitals designed exclusively for Chinese coronavirus patients.The Chinese government on January 16 claimed to finish construction on a 1,500-room hospital in Nangong, located south of Beijing. The hospital, the Communist Party alleged, was reportedly built in five days and is one of six hospitals being constructed in Nangong. The combined facilities will create 6,500 rooms in the city for coronavirus patients. Roughly 650 people are currently being treated for the Chinese coronavirus in Nangong and Shijiazhuang, according to Xinhua on Saturday. The federal government is currently overseeing the construction of a 3,000-room hospital in Shijiazhuang.China’s National Health Commission said on January 16 that the government is struggling to contain the new coronavirus outbreaks, as they are spreading at an exceptionally high rate.“It is harder to handle,” a Commission statement said. “Community transmission already has happened when the epidemic is found, so it is difficult to prevent,” the national health body added before blaming the surge in infections on imported cases.Despite the fact that the outbreaks began erupting about two weeks after widespread mass events for New Year’s Eve nationwide, Chinese officials have blamed the resurgence on foreigners.“They are all imported from abroad. It was caused by entry personnel or contaminated cold chain imported goods,” the National Health Commission’s statement claimed.The rapid construction of Chinese coronavirus hospitals in recent days echoes China’s efforts early last year at the start of the nation’s coronavirus outbreak in the central city of Wuhan. The Chinese government built and opened a 1,000-bed field hospital within two weeks in early 2020 to treat coronavirus patients in Wuhan after local clinics ran out of beds for the then-soaring number of new cases.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinaChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthlockdownlockdowns.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
600,"Chinese authorities locked down 1.7 million people in Beijing on Tuesday as health officials scrambled to contain the spread of a new Chinese coronavirus resurgence across northern China that now threatens the nation’s capital.“Daxing district in southern Beijing … has been sealed off from the rest of the country after six infections were found there. The total number of cases in Beijing stands at 15,” Bloomberg News reported on January 19. Beijing is home to over 20 million people and serves as China’s political center.“Residents from five Daxing apartment complexes have been barred from leaving their homes from Wednesday [January 20],” Bloomberg relayed, citing local government officials. All kindergarten, primary, and secondary students across the district have been ordered to study at home. Gatherings of 50 or more people are now banned in Daxing, while “weddings should be postponed and funerals simplified,” the district government said, according to Agence France-Presse.Daxing’s government has prohibited all 1.7 million residents of the district, which contains Beijing’s newest international airport, from leaving the national capital “unless they have received special permission from the authorities” and tested negative for the Chinese coronavirus in the past three days, officials said. Beijing’s subway operator has shut down the Tiangong Yuan metro station in Daxing, allegedly located near the residences of the districts’ six coronavirus patients.Beijing’s coronavirus outbreak is part of a greater resurgence of the virus that has swept China since early January, affecting Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, multiple northeastern provinces and Hong Kong. In Shanxi province, located west of Hebei, Jinzhong city announced “strict controls on gatherings” on January 11, “with weddings, funerals, public ceremonies, performances and other events banned after it recorded two asymptomatic [coronavirus] cases, both from Hebei.”Chinese health authorities have detected at least 1,000 new Chinese coronavirus infections nationwide since the start of the new year, according to Bloomberg News on Tuesday. The new wave of cases emerged on January 5, a few days after the central city of Wuhan hosted an outdoor New Year’s Eve celebration attended by thousands of people. Chinese state media hailed the city’s mass gathering as a triumph and alleged proof that Wuhan authorities had successfully stamped out the community’s coronavirus outbreak, which emerged in late 2019. Wuhan’s coronavirus outbreak spread to greater China and precipitated the ongoing global Chinese coronavirus pandemic.China’s National Health Commission claimed last week that the majority of new coronavirus infections in northern China are “imported.”“They are all imported from abroad. It was caused by entry personnel or contaminated cold chain imported goods,” the health body said in a statement.“The family cluster cases in Daxing has sounded the alarm that the epidemic situation is tough and complex,” Xu Hejian, a spokesman for Beijing’s municipal government, told reporters on January 19.“We cannot loosen up on preventing imported cases and a domestic rebound,” he added.The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posited on Tuesday that alleged new strains of the Chinese coronavirus have made it especially difficult for officials to contain the latest outbreak.“With mutated viruses more easily spread, anti-epidemic work becomes more difficult,” the Beijing-based CDC said.AsiaHealthNational SecurityBeijingChinaChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthlockdown.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
601,"A professional impersonator of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un said on Wednesday that police in his hometown of Hong Kong arrested him last fall in what he believes was a targeted attack for his open criticism of the Chinese Communist Party.“I was arrested by the HK [Hong Kong] police at my home on Oct 28th 2020. They had a warrant to search my home because according to them, a BB gun had been posted to my address in April 2020 to which I never actually received,” Howard X revealed in a statement posted to his Facebook page on January 20.“Around 10 policemen came to raid the apartment and the official reason for the arrest was ‘possession of a firearm without license,'” he wrote.While BB guns are legal in Hong Kong, Howard said the police told him that the particular air gun mailed to him “had an energy output beyond what was legally allowed and therefore is considered in the same category as a real firearm.”The impersonator said that after police found “nothing” during their search of his apartment, he was “taken away for processing at the [Hong Kong] airport branch police station.” Law enforcement officials later confiscated Howard’s smartphone, according to his account. The Hong Kong police did not charge Howard with any crimes last fall. Instead, they ordered him to report to the same police station where he was processed on October 28 every six weeks. According to Howard, the law enforcement officials said they may eventually charge him for the alleged illegal firearm possession in the future.Howard said he has made “satirical appearances” at various anti-China protest events in Hong Kong over the past few years. He believes his presence at rallies supporting Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement since the summer of 2019 drew the attention of pro-Chinese government officials in the city and contributed to his arrest. Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong last summer as part of a larger crackdown on the city’s pro-democracy movement. The law stripped the city of its traditional semi-autonomy and precipitated a spate of arrests of the movement’s leading activists.Howard said in his Wednesday statement that the Hong Kong police officers who arrested him “indicated that the order came from another department higher up and stated they were just doing their jobs.” He added that the police referenced two specific appearances he made in support of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters at the city’s IFC mall in 2020.“In my opinion this was an arbitrary arrest for my satirical critique of the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] government in the years past and this arrest is being used as a tool not only to harass but to also take my finger prints (every person who gets arrested have their prints taken),” Howard wrote in his social media statement.“It seems so ridiculous … to have up to ten people to come and search my house for a BB gun … something doesn’t seem right,” Howard told the Hong Kong Free Press on January 20.“I think the situation in Hong Kong for artists who criticize the Chinese Communist Party is they are making sure we are paying a price for our criticism,” he added.Howard visited Vietnam in February 2019 as part of his most high-profile satirical appearance to date. He flew to the country and staged a parody summit as Kim Jong-un in Hanoi timed to coincide with an official North Korea-U.S. summit attended by the real Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. The staged appearance upset Vietnamese government authorities, who deported Howard citing his allegedly “invalid” visa.AsiaNational SecurityChinaHong KongKim Jong-un.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
602,"The communist regime governing North Korea held a military parade Thursday, apparently featuring no social distancing or other anti-coronavirus measures, to celebrate the end of its eighth-ever Workers’ Party Congress.Observers noted the parade appeared to feature a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that had yet to make an appearance in North Korea’s military arsenal. The state newspaper Rodong Sinmun confirmed the SLBM’s appearance and boasted it was the “world’s most powerful weapon.”Dictator Kim Jong-un opened the party congress, in which members of the ruling communist Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) set its future agenda and elect party leaders, on a negative note, announcing that North Korea had failed in “almost all sectors” to achieve its five-year goals. He partially blamed the failures on natural disasters and the hardships of fighting the Chinese coronavirus, which Pyongyang claims it has documented zero cases of in the country.In his departing speech, Kim thanked the party for facing their failures and urged the expansion of the country’s “nuclear war deterrent,” by which he meant the nation’s illegal nuclear weapons program.Following the congress, Rodong Sinmun announced Pyongyang had organized a “splendid” parade to celebrate the nation’s robust military.“The world’s most powerful weapon, submarine-launch ballistic missile, entered the square one after another, powerfully demonstrating the might of the revolutionary armed forces,” the newspaper narrated. Along with the missiles, Rodong Sinmun listed “prototype tanks,” “ultra-modern self-propelled artillery pieces,” and “columns of rockets possessed of powerful striking capability for thoroughly annihilating enemies in a preemptive way outside the territory” as present at the parade.“Other proud-worthy Juche-type weapons rolled past the square one after another, demonstrating to the world how our defence industry built up tremendous might since it started its first step with the production of sub-machine gun after the liberation of the country, while covering the untrodden path of army-building,” Rodong Sinmun stated.The newspaper noted that the parade also featured copious praise for Kim.“Cheers of ‘Hurrah!’ for Kim Jong Un and chanting shouts of ‘Kim Jong Un’ and ‘Devoted Defence’ rocked the heaven and earth and fireworks brightly decorated the nocturnal sky,” Rodong Sinmun narrated. “Children presented fragrant flowers to him and leading officials of the Party, the government and the military.”
North Korea’s defense minister, Kim Jong-gwan, spoke at the parade, not Kim Jong-un.“The armed forces of the Republic will strictly contain any military threats in the region of the Korean peninsula,” Kim Jong-gwan reportedly said, “and preemptively use the strongest offensive power to thoroughly smash the hostile forces if they jeopardize the security of our state even a bit, and firmly defend the security of the country and the people and our socialist system.”The South Korean news service Yonhap noted experts observing North Korean state media footage of the parade identified the SLBM as the most advanced weapon rolled out for the occasion. The military did not trot out any intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which typically surface during periods of high tension between North Korea and the United States, as they pose a greater threat to Washington due to the distance they are believed to be able to cover. ICBMs appeared most recently in a North Korean military parade in October.Kim did mention ongoing tensions with America — the Korean War technically never ended — during the party congress, calling America North Korea’s “foremost principal enemy,” but also striking a conciliatory tone in calling for “expanded” foreign relations in general.Kim reaffirmed the nation’s emphasis on developing nuclear weapons in his speech closing the Party Congress on Thursday.“We must further strengthen the nuclear war deterrent while doing our best to build up the most powerful military strength,” Kim said, according to Rodong Sinmun. “We must continue to give fresh spur to making the People’s Army elite and powerful armed forces, so that it is thoroughly prepared to fulfil [sic] its mission and role as the driving force of national defence in the face of any form of threat and emergency.”Kim demanded that his party leaders make the next five years “an era of drastic change, in the revolution and construction and the important tasks in developing the Party, and made an in-depth discussion of them.” He also thanked them for having, “unlike the previous congresses, reviewed and analyzed its work from a critical viewpoint, not seeing only its merits.”South Korean professor Yang Moo-jin told Yonhap that the SLBM is a show of force in light of the impending inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who North Korean media once said “must be beaten to death as quickly as possible.”“North Korea doesn’t need an SLBM. It is not for the South, it’s for the U.S. In that aspect, it sends a message aimed at pressuring the U.S. ahead of the incoming Biden administration,” Yang speculated. “But the North is not sending a message to the U.S. warning that it will take action. It is sending an unspoken message to force the incoming administration to prioritize North Korea in their policies and to withdraw hostile policy against the North.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecuritycommunismKim Jong-unmilitaryNorth KoreaSouth Korea.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
603,"The Chinese Communist Party is using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to crack down on Christians, even arresting some for attending online services via Zoom, David Curry, the CEO of the Christian charity Open Doors, told Breitbart News in an interview on Wednesday.Open Doors released on Wednesday the 2021 edition of its annual World Watch List – a ranking of the world’s most dangerous places to practice the Christian faith. Open Doors is dedicated to aiding Christians in parts of the world where they face persecution, either from the government or from civil society.In 2021, North Korea ranked the top most dangerous place in the world for Christians for the 20th year in a row due to systematic persecution, including execution, of Christians by the totalitarian communist government, which uses force to command popular worship of the nation’s founder, Kim Il-sung, and his family.China ranked 17 among the world’s persecutors of Christians, lower than several nominal democracies such as India and Nigeria due largely to a lack of civil-society-driven mob attacks on Christian communities. The ranking this year, nonetheless, represented a six-spot rise for China between 2020, when it ranked 23, and 2021.“In just three years, the country has risen 26 places, reflecting a rapidly deteriorating situation for Christians in the country,” Open Doors noted.“China has definitely cracked down on religion. They’re returning what I call the ‘government is God’ philosophy that they had when they were connected with the Soviet Union years ago,” Curry told Breitbart News. “What’s unique about China is that they have the capacity and the will to roll out this very sophisticated surveillance system against Christians. And, of course, with COVID [the Chinese coronavirus], people are forced to watch church online.”Curry explained that the use of online tools to congregate with other Christians has resulted in easier surveillance by the Communist Party, although the pandemic itself may not directly have resulted in increased persecution.“They’re taking advantage of COVID to restrict people’s ability to meet, some of which is, of course, understandable. But we have cases, documented cases, where they’re arresting people who are attending Zoom church, where they’re monitoring church online,” Curry explained. “So China is cracking down. It’s not related to COVID, but they are certainly using COVID as a justification to intensify the persecution.”Among the highest-profile examples of Zoom-related church arrests were a series of raids in April 2020 on members of the Early Rain Covenant Church. Chinese communist authorities arrested members of the church during an Easter Sunday online service.Christianity is technically legal in China. China allows only five legal religions – Christianity, “Catholicism,” Taoism, Buddhism, and Islam – but only allows the practice of each under the auspices of “patriotic,” state-controlled institutions. Chinese Catholics cannot legally be part of the Roman Catholic Church, only of the “Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association.” Similarly, non-Catholic Christians in China can only partake in practices led by the “Three-Self Patriotic Church,” a communist entity. Communism is by definition an atheist political ideology, which has made the vast majority of Christians reject communist-led “Christian” services.Estimates suggest that, including the millions of Chinese Christians not participating in legal Christian activity, China is home to one of the largest Christian populations on earth, consisting of as many as 100 million people.Curry explained to Breitbart News that the crackdown on Christianity in China has occurred in tandem with significant repression of all religions and ethnic minorities, perhaps most intensely the repression of majority-Muslim Uyghur people. As of April 2020, the U.S. government believes that as many as two million Uyghurs and other ethnic minority Muslims are trapped in government-run concentration camps in their native Xinjiang region, in northwest China.“The strategy that they’re rolling out, the way they’re scoring Christian behavior, attendance of church, not allowing young people under the age of 18 to go, monitoring online behavior, they’re just very sophisticated how they’re cracking down on religious practice,” Curry said. “I have to point out, it’s not just against Christians. The Uyghur Muslims – religious and ethnic Muslims in the northwest of the country – have faced enormous hardships and human rights abuses at the hands of China.”Curry also noted that Christians exist “all over the country of China.”“There are Uyghurs who are Christians, as well, so you do have intersections in these communities. But you have a different ethnicity in the northwest of the country separate from the Han Chinese, and the government of China seems to be threatened by that,” he explained, “and they’re using some very unique tactics – maybe not unique, but intense tactics – detention, sterilizations, all on the premise that this is a dangerous terrorist group.”“These are, by and large…the massive majority of the people detained are professionals. These are professors and doctors, but they have an ethnicity and/or religion that China is cracking down on,” he noted.Curry told Breitbart News he hopes President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration will use its position to “build on the progress that has been made” in the Trump era in prioritizing religious freedom in foreign policy.“Essentially, what we’d like to see is that they continue what the State Department has done, bringing together – I think it’s now 32 countries – through a ministerial on religious freedom to set some standards worldwide,” Curry noted, referring to the annual conferences founded by the Trump-era State Department to give foreign ministers a venue to discuss how to bolster religious freedom at home. “But I also think you look first to those people we have international relationships with, like India. If China wants to be part of the international community – that is a big question mark – but if they do, we have to have some standards of human rights that are agreed upon.”“The ability to practice people’s faith peacefully, I think, is pretty fundamental. It’s that ability to choose your own faith, to decide what you think in these partnership arrangements,” he explained.AsiaFaithNational SecurityChinaChristian persecutioncommunismDavid CurryOpen DoorsUyghursXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
604,"The Russian Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) announced Thursday that prominent opposition leader and Putin critic Alexei Navalny will face arrest upon his return to Russia, state media outlet Tass reported Thursday.Navalny, who has been in Germany recuperating from an alleged Kremlin-ordered assassination attempt using the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok, earned a spot on Russia’s federal wanted list after surviving the affair and announcing his intent to return to Russia on January 17, according to Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty (RFERL).The Russian dissident became ill during a flight from Siberia to Moscow on August 2020, falling into a coma which prompted his transport to Germany for treatment, despite objections from the Russian doctors treating him. Navalny has since recovered. German doctors declared there was “unequivocal proof” that his mysterious illness was the result of exposure to Novichok, a Russian nerve agent notorious for its use in political assassinations.The stated rationale for Navalny’s outlawry was his alleged violation of a suspended prison sentence by not making known his permanent address to authorities. The Russian Supreme Court, in 2018, upheld a fraud conviction against Navalny and his brother, Oleg, affirming a 2014 ruling which found the pair had laundered $500,000 from French cosmetics company Yves Rocher. Both received three-and-a-half-year prison sentences, but Navalny obtained a probationary reprieve which expired December 30,202, RFERL stated.Russia attracted international scrutiny for its handling of the case, with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) intervening at multiple stages in the appellate process. Despite generally favorable rulings for Navalny outside of Russia, the prison sentence and conviction remain the pretenses for Navalny’s arrest.
In announcing its intent to arrest Navalny upon his return to Russia, the FSIN told reporters:In light of the fact that the real place of residence of the convicted person has been unknown … since September 24, initial inquiry measures were launched against Navalny A. on November 27, 2020. Convicted Navalny A. was placed on the wanted list on December 29 with an instruction to detain him when his whereabouts are identified.The FSIN previously warned Navalny that his lingering in Germany would force action on their part, demanding in December he return to the country or face the prison sentence, the suspension of which was set to expire at the end of the month.The circumstances of Navalny’s exposure to Novichok and the alleged assassination attempt remain unclear. Navalny himself has publicly accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of ordering his death, an accusation which the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.Russian denials have largely come equipped with spectacular counter-theories explaining how Navalny may have exposed to the deadly nerve agent. Putin reportedly suggested to French President Emmanuel Macron that Navalny may have in fact poisoned himself during a phone call in September. In November, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Navalny was actually poisoned upon his arrival in Germany or while on the plane en route to the Charite clinic where he recovered.In late December, Putin again denied ordering Navalny’s death, stating flatly that, had he told his agents to kill him, “they would have finished it.”AsiaLondon / EuropeNational SecurityAlexei NavalnyRussiaVladimir Putin.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
605,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Wednesday that it would not allow any cotton or tomato products from Xinjiang, China’s westernmost province, into the country due to the high likelihood that they were produced by slave labor.Xinjiang is the homeland of the nation’s Muslim-majority Uyghur ethnic group, which has faced severe repression by the Chinese Communist Party for decades, culminating in the construction of over 1,000 concentration camps to house members of the group. Survivors of the camps — which at their peak populations were believed to have imprisoned as many as 3 million people — say that Communist Party officials force Uyghurs and other ethnic minority people to endure indoctrination, torture, forced sterilization, forced abortions, rape, and slavery at those camps.A study released in March 2020 revealed that forced labor was not limited to Xinjiang. According to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), the Chinese government incentivized companies throughout the nation to use Uyghur slaves, presumably shipped out of the Xinjiang camps, in forced labor for the manufacturing of products sold by dozens of international companies, including brand names like Nike, BMW, and Nintendo. Subsequent reports have revealed that cotton-picking, an extremely arduous undertaking, has become a preferred industry for the Chinese Communist Party to force Uyghurs into.In research published last month, Dr. Adrian Zenz revealed Beijing uses sophisticated “poverty alleviation” mobile applications to target Uyghurs to enslave in cotton fields.CBP had previously limited imports into the United States of Xinjiang cotton products by specific companies believed to benefit from slave labor, but has now expanded that to all Xinjiang cotton. It has not limited shipments from other parts of China, where evidence suggests Uyghurs have been bussed in to engage in forced labor.Over 80 percent of the cotton cultivated in China comes from Xinjiang, representing about a fifth of the cotton produced around the world.“DHS [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] will not tolerate forced labor of any kind in U.S. supply chains,” acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said in a statement Wednesday. “We will continue to protect the American people and investigate credible allegations of forced labor, we will prevent goods made by forced labor from entering our country, and we demand the Chinese close their camps and stop their human rights violations.”The CBP explained that the new order will “direct CBP personnel at all U.S. ports of entry to detain cotton products and tomato products grown or produced by entities operating in Xinjiang.” Extensive evidence exists, CBP noted, that tomato products from Xinjiang are also produced using widespread forced labor.“The agency identified the following forced labor indicators through the course of its investigation: debt bondage, restriction of movement, isolation, intimidation and threats, withholding of wages, and abusive living and working conditions,” CBP explained. It listed the affected products as including, but not limited to, “apparel, textiles, tomato seeds, canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, and other goods made with cotton and tomatoes.”Textile manufacturers have complained in the past that limiting imports from China and forcing them to find options that do not use slave labor would hurt their business.“As a country, we simply do not have the capability or capacity to implement or comply with or enforce a blanket WRO [Withhold Release Order],” Stephen Lamar, head of the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA), told Congress in September 2020, objecting to Congress’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which would ban imports from Xinjiang generally with exceptions only for those who can prove their products were not made with forced labor.While most companies accused of using Xinjiang slave labor — even those reportedly lobbying Congress to let them continue the practice, like Nike and Coca-Cola — do not promote the fact that they do business in the region, some openly boast about it. In the credits at the end of the Disney film Mulan, the corporation thanks Xinjiang police authorities, responsible for running the concentration camps, for their help in filming the movie. Companies like Japan’s Uniqlo advertise that their clothing is superior because it is “made from Xinjiang cotton, famous for its superb quality.”The Chinese Communist Party reacted with ire to the new limitations.“China is firmly opposed to this,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday, in response to a question from a reporter about the CBP move. “‘Forced labor’ is the biggest lie of the century made by persons and agencies in some Western countries including the United States, with an aim to restrict and suppress the relevant Chinese authorities and companies and contain China’s development.”Zhao called concerns about slavery “despicable.”Similarly, Wang Wenbin, a colleague of Zhao’s, complained last year that the CBP’s prior limitations on imports from Xinjiang were a “naked act of bullying” against China.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaEconomyNational SecurityChinacommunismcottonSlaveryU.S. Customs and Border ProtectionUyghurUyghursXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
606,"Government officials in Indonesia reprimanded local celebrity Raffi Ahmad on Thursday after he was photographed socializing at a private party on Wednesday hours after participating in the Indonesian government’s official coronavirus vaccination campaign.Photos of Ahmad at a dinner attended by Indonesian celebrities and government officials on Wednesday night went viral online. The event’s attendees did not appear to wear masks or practice social distancing in the photos. Ahmad was singled out for criticism online despite having received his first dose of the Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate CoronaVac at an official Indonesian government health event hours before he was pictured at the party.“Hello Raffi Ahmad, after getting vaccinated it doesn’t mean that you can go out with many people. You were chosen to get the first batch of the vaccine because you have a lot of followers. For the same reason, please consistently set good examples next. Please you can do better than this. Your followers are counting on you,” Indonesian singer Sherina Munaf wrote on Twitter.The head of Indonesia’s presidential secretariat, Heru Budi Hartono, responded to the controversy on Thursday, saying the president’s office would “advise” Ahmad on the matter.Siti Nadia Tarmizi, a spokesman for the Indonesian government’s coronavirus vaccination campaign, reminded Ahmad and others like him who receive a coronavirus vaccine to continue adhering to health protocols on Thursday.“Yes, we should continue to run the program even though we have been vaccinated, because vaccines alone are not enough to protect us and currently vaccines need time to produce antibodies, okay? So keep on guarding ourselves by complying with the health program and running 3M,” he said, referring to the Indonesian government’s three-point coronavirus health protocol: washing hands with soap, using sanitary masks, and maintaining a physical distance.Ahmad issued a video apology for the incident via Instagram on Thursday.“Last night’s party didn’t take place at a public space, but at the house of my friend’s father. Before we entered the house, we had to go through several health protocols. But when I had a meal when I was inside, [I took off my mask and] then there were people who took photos of me,” he said, according to news outlet Coconuts Jakarta.“I apologize as this incident became big. I remind you guys once again, to everyone, to myself, to obey the 3M protocol (washing hands with soap, using face masks, and maintaining physical distance). I don’t want to disappoint many parties, especially because I got to be the first to be vaccinated,” Ahmad said in the video.The Indonesian government chose Ahmad and a limited number of other high-profile Indonesians to receive one of the first available doses of CoronaVac this week. Jakarta contracted the vaccine candidate from Sinovac Biotech, a Chinese biopharmaceutical company, for its national coronavirus vaccination campaign. Indonesian President Joko Widodo was the first person in Indonesia to receive a dose of CoronaVac on Tuesday in a staged procedure broadcast live on national television.“On Monday, Indonesia gave the Sinovac vaccine its first emergency use approval outside China, as interim data from a late-stage clinical trial conducted in the country showed its efficacy rate at 65.3 percent,” Channel News Asia reported on January 12.Other countries, such as Brazil, have also contracted with Sinovac to incorporate CoronaVac into their coronavirus vaccination campaigns. Sinovac’s Brazilian partners said on January 12 that their final stage clinical trials showed CoronaVac to be 50.38 percent effective against the Chinese coronavirus. This announcement followed a previous claim by the same researchers on January 7 that CoronaVac’s efficacy rate was 78 percent.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinese coronaviruscoronavirushealthIndonesiaSinovac.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
607,"What Happened to China’s Richest Man?What Winston Churchill once said about Russia also applies to China: The country is “a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.”Two important cases illustrate the black-box opaqueness of the People’s Republic of China, reminding us just how little we know about what’s happening in the country whose governing citadel in Beijing is called, literally, the Forbidden City.  The first case is the disappearance of one of the country’s richest ($58 billion at its peak, now much less) man, Jack Ma, the 56-year-old founder of the Alibaba Group, a conglomerate of finance and e-commerce companies. Once a high-profile figure on the world stage, active in both business and philanthropy, Ma hasn’t been seen since October 24.So what’s happened to him? It seems that Ma got crosswise with his country’s financial regulators over a new lending venture, and then he compounded his problems by airing his grievances at a financial forum in Shanghai. His actual words, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, might seem mild to a Western ear: “We shouldn’t use the way to manage a train station to regulate an airport. We cannot regulate the future with yesterday’s means.”  Yet evidently, Chinese authorities heard those words and took umbrage. As the Journal reported, “Regulators regarded the speech as a direct attack against them.” And so the bureaucrats ordered the cancellation of the initial public offering of stock in Ma’s new company—a decision that cost the mogul billions. Indeed, the Journal added, “Chinese leader Xi Jinping personally interven[ed] to scuttle the market listing.” Moreover, the newspaper continued, “Beijing is now looking to shrink Mr. Ma’s technology and financial empire and potentially take a larger stake in his businesses.”So where is Ma, himself, physically, right now?  Nobody seems to know, but on January 5, Bloomberg News reported that he “has been advised not to leave the country.” So we can assume that he’s under some sort of house arrest, or perhaps we should say, mansion arrest.Jack Ma listens as Chinese dictator Xi Jinping speaks at a U.S.-China business roundtable September 23, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. (Elaine Thompson/Getty Images)Bloomberg News added, “These investigations and their outcome will have significant ramifications, not only for Jack Ma, but also for the entire Chinese technology and financial industry.” Indeed, it could be that Ma has gotten caught up in official concern over exotic financial mechanisms, such as cryptocurrencies, in which his companies have been dabbling. These “cryptos,” as they are called, pose an obvious risk of fraud, as well as a less obvious, but more profound, risk of undermining the central bank of China. In the meantime, since he suddenly has time on his hands, Ma might be keeping up with the news in China, such as the January 5 report that Lai Xiaomin, the former chairman of an asset management company, having been convicted of “bribery, corruption and bigamy,” has been sentenced to death. In other words, in China, executions for “capitalist roaders” are still a thing.  Then, on January 7, the Financial Times reported that Chinese authorities have begun to censor reports inside China about the status of Ma and his companies. The FT suggests that this cover-up might be because the government is sensitive to international scrutiny on its handling of Ma. Yet it could also be the case that the state has decided to make Ma a non-person—to cancel him. No wonder Alibaba’s stock price has plummeted.So we can step back and see that China, boasting a $13.6 trillion economy, mostly thanks to capitalism—its economy having grown 6,000 percent in the four decades since it opened up to free enterprise—still retains plenty of deeply communist characteristics. As the Ma case seems to prove, in any showdown between capitalist tycoon and communist apparatchik, the communist will win, because the Chinese Communist Party has the guns.  And the price of communist control, even with a capitalist economy, is fear, even terror. As Ma’s case proves, even the richest Chinese are vulnerable to harsh measures, undertaken under mysterious circumstances, and lacking any sort of due process.  As The Financial Times observed on the 12th, the Ma incident “could become a defining moment for the future of private business in Mr Xi’s China.”  If so, then the definition of private business in China is that if a businessperson gets crosswise with a bureaucrat, that could pose a life-changing risk–and that’s not a good look, either for personal freedom or for a healthy business climate.  Stay tuned for flight of talent and capital out of China.(And yes, Ma could possibly reemerge any time; that’s the thing about black boxes—what’s inside is an unknown unknown. All we do know is that Chinese officialdom has gotten its message across: Ma will either have to toe the line, or leave the country if he can; there’s no room for dissent in today’s China.) Meanwhile, the mass of the unlucky and the persecuted in China—including Christians, the newly subjugated people of Hong Kong, followers of Falun Gong, and Uyghur Muslims, together numbering a hundred million souls or more—suffer greatly. And that leaves the remaining population of China, some 1.2 billion, merely fearful of a midnight visit from the police, as well as all the other restrictions that come from China’s mostly totalitarian system.We can even add that Xi Jinping and the other maximum leaders of China pay a price as well. That is, they live in fear of one another, knowing that they can be purged, imprisoned, and perhaps even killed in the wake of a politburo power play.  This was the scary lot of Russian leaders in the Soviet Union, and the result, history shows, was a regime that grew brittle with personal paranoia and institutional paralysis.  Yes, the Chinese have a vastly stronger economy than the Russians ever had, but if the Chinese terrorize themselves, they could lose their wealth—having already, of course, lost their freedom.  In the meantime, there’s also plenty of reason to believe that China has been terrorizing the rest of the world through reckless handling of viruses—and maybe nastier actions than that.  Where Did Covid Come From? So now we come to the second “riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma”—and that’s the origin of Covid-19, which President Trump has been mostly calling, since March, the “China Virus.”  There’s no doubt that the virus came from China; the main question is whether or not it was from the wild, or from a laboratory, specifically, the Wuhan Institute of Virology. As this author noted in April, leading Republicans, including Sens. Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley, were even then pushing for a full investigation of the virus’s origins. Not surprisingly, the Chinese have stonewalled. As Dr. Anthony Fauci said on January 7, looking back at the beginning of the virus crisis, “Some things were known by the Chinese and they weren’t very transparent about it.” This deliberate blockade led David Relman, a Stanford University microbiologist, to write an opinion piece for the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences expressing his strong suspicious that while the virus might have originated in the wild, it was quite possibly “stored knowingly or unknowingly, propagated and perhaps manipulated genetically to understand its biological properties, and then released accidentally.” In other words, the virus came from a Chinese lab, where it had quite possibly been refined and rendered more dangerous.Inside the P4 laboratory in Wuhan, the Chinese biosafety laboratory accused by senior U.S. officials of being at the origin of Covid-19. Picture taken in 2017. (Johannes EISELE/AFP)Then, on January 2, came a report in the Daily Mail (U.K.), quoting Matthew Pottinger, President Trump’s deputy national security adviser, as saying, “There is a growing body of evidence that the lab is likely the most credible source of the virus.” Pottinger added, “Even establishment figures in Beijing have openly dismissed the wet market story”—that is, the notion the virus came from some random bat or beast.  Two days later, in a lengthy piece in New York magazine, author Nicholson Baker assessed the evidence concerning the virus, exploring how it might have come to be so contagious and deadly. Setting the stage, he observed, “It has been a full year, 80 million people have been infected, and, surprisingly, no public investigation has taken place. We still know very little about the origins of this disease.”Baker sees no evidence that Covid was designed to be a Chinese bioweapon, as has been alleged by some, including Li-Meng Yan, a Chinese virologist now living in exile.  Yet as Baker notes, there’s perhaps a fine line between a virus that’s being “researched” and a virus that’s being weaponized.  As he explains, “gain of function” research is explicitly designed to make the virus more potent; the Obama White House described such gain-of-function efforts as “experiments that may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to influenza, MERS, or SARS viruses such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity and/or transmissibility.”  In other words, to make the virus spreadier and deadlier.  Yet why would anyone want do this nasty work? The ostensible answer is that scientists need to better understand the virus, and yet the potential for mayhem is obvious, opening the door to deliberately lethal uses. As author Baker puts it, “We need to stop hunting for new exotic diseases in the wild, shipping them back to laboratories, and hot-wiring their genomes to prove how dangerous to human life they might become.”We should note that bioweapons are banned by international law, and yet we should also note that the PRC doesn’t seem to be worried about international norms. Thus the grim possibility that new killer bioweapons are upon us.  In the meantime, it’s worth noting that China has been doing everything possible to stall inquiry into its virus activities. It’s been jailing Covid whistleblowers in Wuhan—accusing them of “picking fights and provoking trouble”—and clamping down on virus researchers. WHO to the Rescue? Don’t Hope Too Much!The international body officially tasked with health is the United Nation’s World Health Organization (WHO). Okay, you remember WHO. One sharp critic, Dr. Dena Grayson, recalled, in a January 5 tweet, some of its past follies:One year ago today, @WHO was informed of a “pneumonia of unknown cause” in #Wuhan, #China. “No evidence of significant human-to-human transmission.”“WHO does not recommend any specific measures for travelers.”Indeed, over the summer, WHO seemed notably uncurious about the origins of Covid, and overly eager to blame everyone other than China. This Sino-favoritism provoked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to snap that its chief, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had been “bought” by the Chinese.  Now, in January, WHO is poised to investigate the virus—maybe. Having spent months negotiating permission from China to study the virus in and around Wuhan, WHO was just told that its investigators, after all, will not be allowed into China to investigate. Maybe the Chinese government will change its mind again, and maybe it won’t. And yet given WHO’s recent record, perhaps its thwarted investigation isn’t so much of a loss.However, somebody needs to investigate the virus. And who knows, if we start looking for the virus’s origins in China, maybe we’ll also discover the whereabouts of Jack Ma. Yes, maybe we’ll find some answers, but probably not. Because for now, the dictators in Beijing seem to have both the bug and the billionaire locked down tight.Still, the Chinese communist bosses, wielding their immense power in the Forbidden City, might not be resting so easily. That is, every now and then, they might pause and look over at their comrades—even as the comrades might be staring right back. Non-totalitarians can only imagine what sort of Darkness at Noon fate these totalitarians might have in mind for each other.  In the meantime, we have their virus to worry about.AsiaEconomyHealthChinacommunismcoronavirusJack MaWorld Health OrganizationXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
608,"The South China Morning Post and the Economic Times of India have both recently reported that the Chinese Communist Party has withdrawn as many as 10,000 soldiers from the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the official name for the Chinese border with India.The Morning Post reported, citing unnamed “sources and reports” Tuesday, that the move was allegedly the product of the Chinese military concluding that conflict with India would be unlikely during the winter. The LAC lies in extremely difficult-to-navigate mountainous terrain, prone to intense blizzards and avalanches. Even in the summer months, the snowy geography requires significant military training.The move, if confirmed, follows a turbulent half-year in the Himalayas for both China and India. In June, at the height of summer, a brawl erupted between soldiers from both countries, prompted by Indian troops discovering Chinese soldiers present illegally within India. In response to questioning from the Indian border troops, the Chinese reportedly attacked them with rocks and sticks. The incident resulted in tremendous military embarrassment for China, as the Indian Army reportedly killed twice as many, about 40, Chinese soldiers as they lost.The Chinese Communist Party never issued a death count or identified any of the soldiers killed or injured in the incident. The Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, referred to some of the soldiers involved as “martyrs” months after the clash, confirming at least two deaths occurred.Following that brawl, the Indians and Chinese clashed again in September, after India ended decades of precedent and allowed its troops to carry firearms (the firearms ban was responsible for the use of rudimentary weapons in the initial clash). That month, Indian troops took over a strategic mountaintop over Pangong Tso, a lake in occupied Tibet. China claims the Indians unlawfully occupied the territory but has failed to act to remove them.Now, in the dead of winter, China has reportedly begun to bring troops out of the Himalayas, the first reports of retreat after months of indications that China was significantly increasing its presence there.“The withdrawal started more than two weeks ago. All the troops were pulled back in military vehicles, so the Indian side could see it,” one of the unnamed sources told the Morning Post.The report is consistent with what the Economic Times claimed on January 11.“China has moved back close to 10,000 troops from the Ladakh border as the winter peaked in the region,” the Times reported, referring to India’s Ladakh border region. “However, frontline positions remain fully manned by Indian and Chinese troops along contentious points on the Line of Actual Control. Sources said that PLA [People’s Liberation Army] moved troops deployed in depth [sic] areas by over 100 km into Tibetan territory as scope for any operations have diminished due to the harsh winter and heavy snow.”The Economic Times, like the Morning Post, suggested “the Chinese pull back [sic] was necessary as keeping over 50,000 troops at snowbound high altitudes was untenable. However, the situation along the border remains tense as both sides have kept tanks, artillery guns and armoured personnel carriers ready along the border.”An unnamed official noted that current temperatures in the Himalayan peaks where China is reportedly retreating are under -40º Fahrenheit.The newspaper noted that, prior to the withdrawal, observers estimated about 50,000 Chinese troops and 50,000 Indian troops were facing off in the region. Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh testified at a public hearing in September that China had deployed “a huge number of Army battalions and armaments” to prevent another incident like the one in June, which occurred in India’s Galwan Valley, and that India had responded with “counter-deployments.”“China doesn’t recognize the traditional and customary alignment of the boundary. We consider that this alignment is based on well established geographical principals,” Singh warned at the time. “India and China border issue remains unresolved. Till now, there has been no mutually acceptable solution. China disagrees on the border.”The Galwan Valley clash resulted in the removal of General Zhao Zongqi as head of the People’s Liberation Army Western Theater Command, the top military officials responsible for the territory where the clash occurred. Chinese media tepidly announced his departure, noting his retirement age, though observers believe his involvement in the incident played a role, as those still in dictator Xi Jinping’s good graces can often continue in their jobs over the age of 65.State media did not mention Zhao in its report on his removal from office, instead congratulating successor Zhang Xudong on his new role.The harsh winter conditions have cooled military activity on the LAC, but not fully stopped it. Last week, media from both countries revealed the Indian government had captured a Chinese soldier illegally present on its side of the border, reportedly mulling around the banks of Pangong Tso. In a statement, the Indian army noted that the transgression did not appear to be a threat to India and that the soldier was “being dealt with.” Indian authorities returned him to China this week.Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityChinacommunismGalwan ValleyIndiaLine of Actual ControlPangong Tsopeople's liberation army.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
609,"Rural governments in China are banning funerals and weddings to contain a recent spread of the Chinese coronavirus across northern provinces including Hebei, which surrounds the national capital, Beijing, the South China Morning Post reported Tuesday.Local government authorities sealed off Hebei’s provincial capital, Shijiazhuang, along with the neighboring city of Xingtai, last week to contain a regional surge in new daily coronavirus cases.“Outlying villages around the two cities account for around 70 percent of cases in the latest outbreak,” according to the report.“Over 70 percent of those infected in the city [Shijiazhuang] are farmers, the majority of whom are from middle-aged and elderly groups,” Hebei health official Li Qi said at a January 12 press conference.“Those infected had attended weddings, funerals, or other village activities in recent weeks,” local health authorities revealed.In northern Shanxi province, located west of Hebei, the city of Jinzhong announced “strict controls on gatherings” on January 11, “with weddings, funerals, public ceremonies, performances and other events banned after it recorded two asymptomatic [coronavirus] cases, both from Hebei,” according to the SCMP.“While respiratory infectious diseases are easier to spread in winter, intensive social events such as weddings and funerals in villages accelerated the [Chinese coronavirus] transmissions,” Feng Zijian, deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Xinhua, China’s state news agency, on Monday.Funerals and weddings in rural China can involve hundreds, or even thousands, of guests.“They are an important element of traditional Chinese culture and low attendances involve a huge loss of face for the families,” the SCMP noted on Monday.“Funerals and weddings are just social customs. What the government should do is to improve medical services and awareness in rural areas, instead of simply calling the events to a halt,” a user of the Chinese social media platform Weibo wrote this week of the gathering ban, according to the newspaper.Roughly 600 million people currently reside in China’s rural areas. The state government has seemingly underestimated or even ignored the risk of the Chinese coronavirus spreading to China’s countryside, according to Wu Hao, a member of a specialist team from China’s National Health Commission.“The Hebei outbreak rang an alarm bell,” Wu told Xinhua on Monday, adding that “poor public health awareness, mass gatherings and failures at a grass-roots level were to blame for the outbreaks” in rural China.China’s National Health Commission reported 55 new coronavirus cases on Monday. Of the new infections, 40 were recorded in Hebei province, one was documented in Beijing, and another case was found in northeastern Heilongjiang province, which borders Russia.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinacoronavirusfuneralsrural districtsRural Liferural livingwedding.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
610,"Indonesian President Joko Widodo received his first dose of CoronaVac, a Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine candidate, on live TV this week.The Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech developed CoronaVac. Various countries outside China have contracted with Sinovac to use CoronaVac in their national coronavirus vaccination campaigns, including Indonesia. President Joko Widodo — or “Jokowi,” as he is popularly known — became the first person in Indonesia to receive CoronaVac on Tuesday. A government health official administered Jokowi’s first dose at the presidential palace in Jakarta. The vaccination was broadcast live on national television to launch Indonesia’s coronavirus vaccination campaign, which is expected to be the largest in Southeast Asia and one of the largest in the world.WATCH: Indonesia President Joko Widodo receives the nation's first injection of China's Sinovac shot, kicking off Southeast Asia’s largest Covid vaccination program https://t.co/3obSlX3l6u pic.twitter.com/jNhbmY3YJY— Bloomberg Asia (@BloombergAsia) January 13, 2021“This COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccination is important for us to break the chain of this coronavirus transmission and provide health, safety, and protection for all Indonesians,” Widodo said after the event, according to Channel News Asia (CNA).Indonesia’s mass coronavirus vaccination campaign would also help to boost the country’s economy, he added.A number of presidential cabinet members who attended Jokowi’s vaccination event on Tuesday “will also be inoculated on Wednesday [January 13],” according to CNA.“On Monday, Indonesia gave the Sinovac vaccine its first emergency use approval outside China, as interim data from a late-stage clinical trial conducted in the country showed its efficacy rate at 65.3 percent,” CNA reported on January 12. Brazilian scientists partnered with Sinovac said on January 12 that final data showed CoronaVac was 50.38 percent effective against the Chinese coronavirus in their final stage clinical trials, despite previously claiming on January 7 that the vaccine candidate’s efficacy rate was 78 percent. Sinovac’s CoronaVac requires two doses to be effective. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body’s immune system to the Chinese coronavirus.Indonesia’s health ministry has said it expects to administer CoronaVac to “[n]early 1.5 million medical workers … by February, followed by public servants and the general population within 15 months.”An estimated 1.48 million health workers in Indonesia will receive CoronaVac starting this week, CNA reported on Tuesday. Roughly 17.4 million Indonesian public officers in the “high-risk” health category will be the next demographic to receive CoronaVac after health workers.“More than 560,000 people are expected to be vaccinated in January, while the remaining 900,000 are scheduled to receive the jab in February,” according to the Singapore-based news agency.An estimated “21.5 million people in the elderly group will be vaccinated starting April using vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, followed by workers between 18 and 59 years old,” Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said in the country’s parliament on January 12.Budi said January 3 that Indonesia “needs to vaccinate 181.5 million people, or roughly 67 percent of its population, to reach herd immunity, and requires almost 427 million doses of vaccines, assuming a double-dose regimen and a 15 percent wastage rate.”Indonesia officially documented 858,043 cases and 24,951 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus at press time on Wednesday, making it the worst-hit country by the virus in Southeast Asia.AsiaHealthNational SecurityChinese coronaviruscoronavirusCoronavirus vaccinehealthIndonesiaJoko WidodoSinovac.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
611,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday that the presidency “is not for women” and that he has discouraged his politician daughter, Sara Duterte, from running for president of the Philippines.“My daughter is not running. I have told Inday not to run because I pity (her) knowing she will have to go through what I am going through,” Duterte said at the launch of a highway project on January 14. He referred to Sara by her nickname, Inday.“This is not for women. You know, the emotional set-up of a woman and a man is totally different. You will become a fool here. So … that is the sad story,” Duterte said, as quoted by Reuters.Political observers view Sara Duterte as a frontrunner in the Philippines’ next presidential election in 2022. She currently serves as the mayor of Davao City, located on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao. Sara succeeded her father as mayor of Davao City after he served as the city’s leader off and on for several years from 1988 to 2016 until leaving the post to take the nation’s highest office. Philippine presidents are elected to a single, six-year term, meaning Rodrigo Duterte cannot run for reelection in 2022.According to Reuters on Thursday, Sara “came top in a recent opinion poll that asked the [Philippine] public to choose a preferred candidate from a list of possible contenders for the 2022 elections.”Sara Duterte told Reuters on January 14 that she does not intend to run for president of the Philippines in 2022, adding that she has informed her father of this lack of intention.“I am not being coy nor am I doing a ‘last-minute,’” she said in a text message to the news agency.“If the whole country does not want to believe (this) then I can’t do anything about it. Not everyone wants to be president. I am one of them,” Sara said.“I thank all of them for their trust and confidence in what I can do but my refusal to run for president is not the end of the world,” she added.If Sara Duterte does not run for president in 2022, legendary boxer and Philippine legislator Manny Pacquiao will have an even greater shot at the role. Pacquiao was elected president of the Philippines’ ruling political party, PDP-Laban, last month, reigniting speculation that he may run for president in 2022.The Philippines has had two female presidents since its establishment as a commonwealth in 1935. Corazon Aquino served as president of the Philippines from 1986-1992, followed by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from 2001-2010. Arroyo established herself as an ally of Rodrigo Duterte in 2018 after she was elected the Philippines’ Speaker of the House of Representatives. She retired from the post in 2019.

612,"Christians in India face persecution “in all areas of public and private life,” according to a study by the Christian Aid group Open Doors.In majority Hindu India, “Christians are persecuted in all areas of public and private life, and anti-conversion laws (currently in nine states, with more considering adoption) are abused to harass and intimidate Christians,” according to the organization. Although few people are actually convicted under the anti-conversion laws, related cases “can drag on for years.”According to the U.S.-based Open Doors, “Hindu extremists” in India “believe that all Indians should be Hindus, and that the country should be rid of Christianity and Islam. They use extensive violence to achieve this goal, particularly targeting Christians from a Hindu background.”Indian Christians are often accused of adopting a “foreign faith” and may be blamed for perceived “bad luck” within their majority Hindu communities. The tension has lead to Christians suffering physical attacks and being killed by fellow community members in extreme instances. Hindu converts to Christianity are “under constant pressure from their family and community to return to Hinduism,” according to the study. “If they do not ‘re-convert,’ they may be boycotted by their community, with a devastating effect on their ability to earn income.”The ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the economic and social blacklisting of Christians in India.“Christians are often deliberately overlooked when official COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] food and aid are distributed,” Open Doors revealed.Many Christian converts in India belong to the low-ranking Dalit caste. The marginalization of Dalits within India’s caste system precedes the recent upsurge in Christian oppression, meaning they already struggled to find work and provide their families with basic needs.Open Doors’ latest study of Christian persecution in India echoes a 2017 report on religious freedom in India by the U.S. Commission on Interreligious Freedom (USCIRF).“Conditions for religious minorities [in India] have deteriorated over the last decade due to a multifaceted campaign by Hindu-nationalist groups like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sang (RSS), Sangh Parivar, and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) to alienate non-Hindus or lower-caste Hindus,” USCIRF wrote.“The victims of this campaign include Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains, as well as Dalit Hindus, who belong to the lowest rung in the Hindu caste system. These groups face challenges ranging from acts of violence or intimidation to the loss of political power,” according to the report.An Indian parliament member belonging to India’s ruling, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) presided over a religious ceremony in southwestern India’s Karnataka state on November 29 in which 23 Christians converted to Hinduism. The established ceremonies, in which Christians or Muslims convert to Hinduism, are referred to as ghar wapsi or “homecoming(s)” in Hindi by Indian Hindu nationalists.“These ceremonies are based on the view that all individuals born in India are Hindus by default, even if their communities have practiced other faiths for several generations,” according to the USCIRF.Anant Kumar Hegde, a local BJP leader in Karnataka, presided over the November 29 ghar wapsi in the town of Haliyal Taluk.Roughly 80.5 percent of India’s population of 1.4 billion people adhere to the Hindu faith.

613,"The human rights magazine Bitter Winter reported on Wednesday that the government of Afghanistan deported ten Chinese nationals last week initially accused of engaging in terrorist activity, but later believed to be attempting to create a fake Uyghur terrorist cell to defame the ethnic group.Reports of the arrests in Kabul first surfaced in India’s Hindustan Times and named the alleged leader of the group as Li Yangyang, a Han Chinese name. The Hindustan Times was the first to report, last week, that Kabul had reached a deal with China to return the Chinese citizens implicated to their home country without creating a public scandal.“Last week, a chartered plane left Kabul airport to an unknown destination in China. Aboard were ten Chinese nationals, who had been arrested in Afghanistan on December 10,” Bitter Winter noted on Wednesday, “some in the house of one Li Yangyang, believed to be a high-profile intelligence agent, where weapons, ammunitions, and drugs had also been found.”Afghan authorities had collected evidence linking the group of ten to the Haqqani Network, a deadly jihadist organization with ties to the Taliban. Subsequent evidence seemed to indicate, however, that the group in question was not looking to engage in legitimate jihadist activity but, rather, create a fraudulent jihadist organization presumably manned by ethnic Uyghur people, according to the initial report from the Hindustan Times.The Indian newspaper stated that China attempted to pressure the Afghan government to “hush up the case.” Given the little information from officials in either Afghanistan or China, if the story is true, Beijing may have succeeded. Afghanistan’s First Vice President Amrullah Saleh publicly denied that any arrests of Chinese citizens had occurred at all.“No foreign citizen has been arrested in an effort operation in the Khairkhaneh area. The arrested are the palmadis that are under the scope,” Saleh said in December in a Facebook post. “A number of them have been arrested on suspicion of being involved in kidnapping and assassination.”By the new year, however, the head of Afghanistan’s National Directorate of Security (NDS) admitted that Chinese individuals had been arrested in the country.“Regarding the Chinese network, I can confirm for you that, yes, they have been arrested; however, I can’t go into the details because of the sensitive nature of the case,” Ahmad Zia Saraj affirmed last week, according to Afghanistan’s Tolo news agency.The Bitter Winter details largely regurgitate a Hindustan Times report from last week that claims the Chinese citizens arrested have returned home. Citing “people familiar with the matter,” the Indian newspaper claimed that Afghanistan had demanded a formal apology not to file charges against those arrested. No evidence exists that China provided an apology, but “diplomats and security officials in Kabul … confirmed to Hindustan Times that the 10 had been allowed to board a chartered aircraft that flew them out of the country on Saturday,” January 2, the newspaper claimed. The report asserted that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had personally approved the release.The reports followed the announcement in November by the government of the United States that it would no longer list the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an alleged Uyghur jihadist organization, as a designated foreign terrorist organization. Uyghurs refer to Xinjiang as “East Turkestan,” reflecting their Turkic heritage; “Xinjiang” comes from the Han Mandarin for “frontier land.” While once identified as a legitimate terrorist outfit, the head of ETIM, Hasan Mahsum, died in 2003, and American authorities asserted in explaining their decision, “for more than a decade, there has been no credible evidence that ETIM continues to exist.”China has used the alleged existence of Uyghur jihadist organizations as a reason to implement extreme repressive tactics against the Uyghur ethnic minority. China has accused hundreds of unidentified Uyghurs of joining the Islamic State and claims that the lack of terrorist activity in Xinjiang is the result of its policy of building concentration camps for millions of people belonging to the indigenous population of Xinjiang.As of April 2020, the U.S. government believed that as many as 2 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic minority people were trapped in Xinjiang concentration camps. Survivors of the camps have testified publicly to being tortured and forced into indoctrination classes to renounce their Islamic faith and worship Chinese dictator Xi Jinping. Some say they experienced or witnessed the widespread use of rape, forced abortions, and forced sterilizations; some mothers say Chinese government officials killed their infants in the camps. Others say they were enslaved, forced to engage in labor to manufacture products for the profit of the government.The Chinese Communist Party claims the camps are necessary to fight jihad and those imprisoned there are uneducated people who require “vocational education” to find adequate work. Those who struggle economically, Beijing claims, are more likely to engage in terrorism, so the state invested in developing “vocational centers” to discourage them from embracing “extremism.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.AsiaNational SecurityAfghanistanChinacommunismjihadUyghur.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
614,"Indian government officials expect “several million” people to gather in northern India’s Uttarakhand state over the next several weeks as part of the Hindu Kumbh Mela pilgrimage.Four different cities in India alternate hosting duties for Kumbh Mela. “This year, beginning Thursday [January 14], Haridwar is the host, and several million people were expected to throng the holy city in Uttarakhand over the coming seven weeks,” Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported Wednesday.“The pandemic is a bit of a worry, but we are taking all precautions,” festival organizer Siddharth Chakrapani told AFP, adding that he “expected between 8,00,000 to 10 lakh [1 million] people to attend on Thursday alone.”“I’m sure Maa Ganga will take care of their safety,” he said, referring to the Hindu goddess of the Ganges River, considered sacred in the Hindu religion. Hindus believe that immersing themselves in the waters of the Ganges during Kumbh Mela absolves them of their sins and breaks the cycle of birth and death.“Some 800 hotels and 350 ashrams in Haridwar have been prepared to accommodate approximately 1.25 lakh [125,000] pilgrims on any given day during the Kumbh. While the tourism department was expecting around 10 crore [100 million] pilgrims, restrictions imposed to ensure social distancing has curtailed the figure,” the Indian Express reported Wednesday.“Additionally, a 156-sq km ‘mela area’ [fairground] has also been demarcated in three [Uttarakhand] districts of Haridwar, Dehradun, and Pauri Garhwal, for people associated with hospitality, tourism and civil supply, and adjoining areas of western UP [Uttar Pradesh state], to get business during this time,” according to the newspaper.Uttarakhand Urban Development Minister Madan Kaushik said last month that Kumbh Mela will be held for 48 days instead of the typical three-and-a-half months. However, the Indian Express reported on January 13 that the event will take place from January 14 to April 27.Uttarakhand police said Wednesday that the Indian National Security Guard (NSG) would deploy a special anti-terror squad to Haridwar during Kumbh Mela to protect participants from “anti-national elements” — possibly referring to entities that might target the Hindu festival due to its association with the religion of India’s ruling, Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP promotes the interests of India’s Hindu majority and has recently passed legislation across several states criminalizing forced religious conversion through the guise of marriage, termed “Love Jihad.”“[T]o take action against the anti-national elements, two NSG teams will be deployed during Kumbh Mela. The NSG teams will also train our Anti-Terrorist Squad,” Uttarakhand Police Commissioner Ashok Kumar told reporters on January 13.Known as the “world’s largest human gathering,” Kumbh Mela translates loosely to “festival of the sacred pitcher.”“According to Hindu mythology, gods and demons fought a war over a sacred pitcher containing the nectar of immortality.

615,"LONDON (AP) – Regulators in the UK and four other countries have announced new rules to fast-track the development of modified COVID-19 vaccines to ensure drugmakers can move swiftly to target emerging variants of the disease.Previously authorized vaccines that are modified to combat new variants “will not need a brand new approval or `lengthy’ clinical studies,” Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said Thursday.“The clear goal is that future vaccine modifications that respond to the new variants of coronavirus can be made available in the shortest possible time to UK recipients without compromising at any stage on safety, quality or effectiveness,” Dr June Raine, the head of the agency, said in a briefing for reporters.The new guidance is based on the model already used to modify the seasonal flu vaccine to keep up with annual changes in the virus and was issued jointly by regulators in the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore, and Switzerland. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency have issued similar guidance.Under the new rules, developers will be required to provide “robust evidence” that modified COVID-19 vaccines produce a strong immune response to the variant, as well as data showing they are safe and meet quality standards.This means developers will be required to carry out small-scale trials on a few hundred people, rather than the trials in tens of thousands of individuals that were required for initial approval, said Dr Christian Schneider, the MHRA’s chief scientific officer.‘Every Vaccine is Welcome’: Merkel Looks to Russian Jab Amid EU Vax Blunders https://t.co/aMXLiIieR0— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 3, 2021“I’d like to emphasize that to date we don’t have evidence that the vaccines in use in the UK are significantly lacking in effectiveness,” Raine said.The announcement comes amid concerns that the virus that causes COVID-19 may mutate to create new variants that are resistant to existing vaccines. The UK has banned direct flights from 33 countries in an effort to prevent variants first discovered in Brazil and South Africa from becoming established in Britain.Vaccine makers have already been developing booster shots to target the new variants.Moderna said Feb. 24 that it had shipped a variant-specific vaccine candidate to the U.S. National Institutes of Health for review.The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 115 million people around the world and killed at least 2.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.EU Regulator Begins Rolling Review of Russian Vaccine https://t.co/qRBjXKN4OX— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2021HealthLondon / EuropeScienceAustraliaBritainCanadacoronavirusCOVID-19Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory AgencypandemicSingaporeSwitzerlandUnited KingdomvaccinationvaccinesWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
616,"Priti Patel’s Home Office has reportedly failed to launch a single deportation flight for illegal migrants since the United Kingdom officially left the European Union’s institutions at the beginning of the year.So far this year, a record 587 boat migrants have been brought ashore by the authorities, with 66 illegals landing on Tuesday. This is over double the number that landed during the same time period last year, which stood at 246, according to the BBC.Following Brexit, the United Kingdom amended its immigration laws, meaning that migrants can no longer claim asylum if they were either intercepted at sea or are found to have passed through a safe third country prior to coming to Britain.Despite this, the Home Office under the leadership of Priti Patel has yet to carry out any flights to deport the hundreds of migrants that have landed this year, The Telegraph reports.The EU’s Dublin agreement on the return of migrants expired following the end of the 2020 “transition” period in which the UK remained an EU member in all but name. Since then, the government has failed to come to an agreement with the European Union over the return of failed asylum seekers or illegal migrants, and is still not turning them back on its own initiative.The Telegraph claimed that the negotiations are currently ongoing, but there has been no indication that a deal is imminent.If an agreement were to be reached, it is still unclear as to how effective it would be, as many migrants destroy their personal documents prior to attempting to reach Britain illegally, also making it difficult to persuade their native country to take them back.The Boris Johnson administration also has expressed no intention of leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, upheld by the European Court of Human Rights which still has jurisdiction in Britain.This prohibits sending migrants back to their countries if they are likely to suffer from torture or other inhumane treatment, even if they are terrorists, sexual predators, or otherwise present a danger to the public.UK Deportations of Foreign Criminals Fell 79 per cent Last Year, Despite Patel’s Promises to ‘Get Tough’ https://t.co/5PazItcV8R— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 19, 2021“Despite Government efforts, such as they are, the situation gets worse. Indeed, it’s a mess.

The French too must deal more effectively with the problem at their end and stop escorting illegal immigrants into British waters.”A Home Office spokesman simply repeated that with Brexit, the United Kingdom is no longer bound by the “EU’s Dublin Regulation which was rigid, inflexible and often abused by meritless claims that would effectively time out the process.”“The UK will continue to seek to return people who have no right to be here and arrive in the UK through illegally-facilitated crossings,” the spokesman added, failing to acknowledge the fact that this is not actually happening.Report: Glasgow Stabber 'Very Hungry' Sudanese Man, Migrants Unhappy with 'Culturally Inappropriate' Spaghetti, Mac and Cheese Meals at Hotel https://t.co/uFjJ9zGfJh— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 27, 2020The report also revealed that the former military barracks turned migrant camp in Folkestone, Kent, has cost the British taxpayer nearly £1 million to police since opening in September of last year.Amid record-breaking illegal boat migration last year, the Home Office began housing migrants, some of whom were lethally violent, in hotels across the country.As the waves of illegal migrants continued to pour into the country, the government began using former military bases, such as the Napier Barracks in Kent, to accommodate the overflowing migrant population.The government’s policing minister, Kit Malthouse, granted Kent Police some £850,000 to cover the costs of policing the asylum seekers in the camp.Migrants in the camp have staged several protests and hunger strikes since their arrival, necessitating a police presence to monitor the situation.In January, a fire broke out in the camp, with 14 of the migrants being arrested in connection to the suspected arson attack.Illegal Migrants Unhappy with Free Accommodation in 'Racist' UK Want to Return to EU https://t.co/xBqAni6Zct— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaImmigrationLondon / EuropeAlp Mehmetasylum seekersBoat MigrantsChannel CrisisChannel MigrantsdiversityEnglish ChannelEurope Migrant CrisisFolkestonehome officeIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationIllegal MigrantsMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant Campmigrant campsMigrant CrisisMigrant Hotelsmigration watchMigration Watch UKMulticulturalismNigel Faragepriti patelSocial CohesionUK Border ForceUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

In addition, the police wanted him to make a testimony in Swedish.”“Although Mr Bugnyár speaks Swedish, he would not have felt comfortable communicating in Swedish in a criminal case, so he asked for an interpreter on the telephone.

I left without a prescription, and he didn’t ask me for my health card or payment,” she said.Just hours later, the woman told her parents about the incident and filed a complaint. Dr Almosawy, who has practised medicine in Bourges for 46 years, has no criminal record but has had one similar prior complaint, though it was dismissed.London: NHS Migrant Doctor Gets ‘Life’ Sentence After 90 Sexual Assault Convictions https://t.co/AF5crejqQn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2020“All she’s talking about is bullshit!” Almosawy said, and claimed the entire case was a racist conspiracy against him from the Board of the Order of Physicians.

619,"The British government is reportedly planning to make vaccines for the Chinese coronavirus mandatory for healthcare workers, in a move described by unions as “sinister”.Amid reports of vaccine refusal among some segments of Britain’s socialised healthcare system, the National Health Service (NHS), the government is said to be considering forced inoculations for healthcare staff.The government is currently reviewing plans that would see healthcare workers forced to take the vaccine or face exclusion from vaccine passport eligibility, the Daily Mail reported.“It is extraordinary that so many people in the health sector appear to have turned down the vaccine,’ a Cabinet source told the paper.A government spokesman added: “While it is for Government and parliament to decide which groups of people are required to get the vaccine, the NHS national medical director and chief nurse agree with Chris Whitty, with the chairman of the BMA and other professional leaders that NHS staff have a duty to be vaccinated unless they have a valid clinical reason not to do so.”These NHS staff were told the swine flu vaccine was safe, and now they're suffering the consequences https://t.co/9ayUUnQRDS pic.twitter.com/x3G5T28XlE— BuzzFeed UK (@BuzzFeedUK) February 24, 2018Though the government is said to be reticent to fire healthcare workers who refuse the jab, they may instead opt to demote the staff to non-front line positions.The plans have sparked widespread backlash, considering the fact that the government has consistently claimed that vaccinations in Britain will be voluntary.The general secretary of Unison, a leading NHS union, Christina McAnea said: “Forced vaccinations are the wrong way to go, and send out a sinister and worrying message.”“Encouragement and persuasion rather than threats and bullying are key to a successful programme, as ministers themselves have repeatedly indicated. Mandatory jabs are counterproductive and likely to make those who are hesitant even more so. This will do nothing to help health and care sectors that are already chronically understaffed,” she added.COVID-1984: European Union Officially Announces Vaccine Passport Scheme, UK May Join https://t.co/sZTVKW4Gn4— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021The government has also previously denied that it would roll out a vaccine passport for people domestically, for example to go to the pub or the supermarket.However, a review of how to implement such a scheme is currently being undertaken by Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who expressly shot down the idea in December. The forced vaccination scheme for healthcare workers is reportedly being considered as a part of the review.On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “It is clear that we will need to provide people with the ability to certify whether they have had the jab. And we will need to absolutely take into consideration those who have a certified clinical reason why they can’t have the jab.”Some 200,000 NHS and care home employees are believed to have refused to take the vaccine across the country.While this means that over 90 per cent of all healthcare workers have had the injection, the number in certain localities is much lower, particularly in London where nearly a quarter of NHS workers have turned down the jab, despite having priority access.The government has reportedly been concerned with a hesitancy among so-called BAME (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic) groups to take the vaccine.A review carried out last month at the Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London found that only a quarter of black and Filipino staff had taken the vaccine,  as compared to 80 per cent of staff as a whole.Quarter of London NHS Staff Have Refused to Take Coronavirus Vaccines https://t.co/x6wn48zJ7J— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropePoliticscoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineCOVID-19National Health ServiceNHSNursesUnited KingdomVaccinevaccine passportVaccine Passportsvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

622,"Australia’s finance minister has suggested that a “desperate” European Union is “tear[ing] up the rule book” after the European Commission backed Italy’s request to block a shipment of coronavirus vaccines.Media reported on Thursday that the European Commission, the bloc’s powerful unelected executive arm, headed by former German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen, backed Rome’s request to ban the shipment of 250,000 doses from its Anagni plant because of the “continuing shortage of vaccines in the EU and in Italy and delays in supplies from AstraZeneca to the EU and Italy,” according to the Italian foreign ministry. The seized doses are expected to be redistributed across the EU27.The Australian government signalled on Friday that it would not affect the country’s overall rollout, as it had doses expected from other plants. The country’s finance minister, Simon Birmingham, appeared to give a veiled criticism of the EU, however, telling Sky News Australia: “The world is in unchartered territory at present — it’s unsurprising that some countries would tear up the rule book.“This is a demonstration of really how well Australia continues to do compared to the desperation of other countries.”Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, struck a generous note in which he appeared to sympathise with the plight of the Europeans, who under the leadership of von der Leyen and the bloated bureaucracy of the EU have experienced severe delays in their vaccine programme. While the nearby Brexit Britain has given doses to some 30 per cent of its population, the EU has barely managed eight per cent on average.Farage: ‘Nasty, Vindictive’ EU Threats on Vaccines Shows UK Was Right to Vote Leave https://t.co/MbxRxsJ0v8— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 27, 2021Prime Minister Morrison said: “This particular shipment was not one we’d counted on for the rollout, and so we will continue unabated.”“In Italy, people are dying at the rate of 300 a day. And so I can certainly understand the high level of anxiety that would exist in Italy and in many countries across Europe,” Morrison said.“They are in an unbridled crisis situation. That is not the situation in Australia,” he added.Others were far more openly critical of Brussels, including Matthew Lesh of British think tank the Adam Smith Institute, who called the situation “a very clear demonstration of closed, self-interested and nationalistic behaviour. The world should not tolerate this bullying.“Australia isn’t responsible for the European Union’s failure to secure enough doses or vaccinate across her population — Australia’s most vulnerable shouldn’t have to bear the consequences.”The bloc introduced export controls on Chinese coronavirus vaccines following initial delays at AstraZeneca’s European plants in January.While the Commission initially attempted to blame the drugs maker for the delays — even demanding British-made vaccines be sent to Europe to make up the shortfall — it was revealed by the company’s CEO that European plants were behind because the EU delayed in signing a contract with AstraZeneca, some three months after the United Kingdom.That was said to have impacted the development of laboratory processes in Europe, meaning a shortfall in the initial batch expected by Brussels.Britain took a gamble by investing in vaccines early which paid off, meaning that at one point during last month, more people in the United Kingdom had had a dose of the vaccine than in the whole European Union combined.Farage: “If this crisis has taught us anything, it is that the best decisions are taken by national governments acting in their national interest.

They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face.

The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
626,"A parent has described to a major British newspaper the prospect of a “mask apartheid” when schools reopen next week, after some educators have determined that while they cannot legally force children to wear masks, they will be segregated from their peers.The Conservative Party government has recommended that secondary school pupils (aged 11 to 18) wear masks in areas of schools where they are not able to socially distance, such as in classrooms and other confined spaces where children cannot keep two metres (six feet) apart.However, despite face coverings for pupils not being mandatory, parents have told The Telegraph that they have been notified if their children do not wear them, they will be forced to sit at the back of the class and even be segregated from their friends at lunch.One school, The Stonehenge School in Amesbury, Wiltshire, also appeared to emotionally blackmail parents and children by saying that “their peers may not wish to sit with or work with them” if pupils aren’t wearing masks. Non-compliant children at The Stonehenge School would also be “asked to sit near open doors or windows”.Sources speaking to the newspaper outlined that other punishments include children being forced to go through a separate entrance and being barred from group class activities such as PE and drama and after-school clubs.The Department for Education has said that children must not be “denied education” if they refuse to wear masks; however, some schools have allegedly threatened to send pupils home to get a mask or even expel mask refusers, on the grounds that uncovered children “risk” the safety of staff members.“The most worrying thing I find about the whole last year is the enthusiasm with which people have embraced the diminution of their civil liberties and their ordinary lives.""  https://t.co/cI6hPvc7er— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2021One parent told The Telegraph that the plans represented a “mask apartheid”, explaining: “If you start treating children differently, it will impact on their ability to learn. The Government needs to be very clear that no pupils should be discriminated against in this way.”Allyson Pollock, Clinical Professor of Public Health at Newcastle University, said there is “no evidence” that wearing masks in class stops transmission and criticised the “coercion” of children. She also warned of the “other harms are emerging as a result – psychological trauma, isolation, segregation stigmatising children”, condemning schools for institutionalising “a form of abuse and harassment and intimidation of children and parents”.Baronness Fox of Buckley, who has condemned the government for recommending masks in classrooms, said of the report that the proposed measures were  “creating totally unnecessary and divisive stress for all. No attempt to even justify them via evidence/efficacy — just a defensive emphasis [the guidance] will be reviewed at Easter. In the meantime, classrooms are not safer, but more alienating.”The report follows another by the same publication which revealed claims that schools are “blackmailing” parents into consenting to have their children tested for coronavirus in the next few weeks, allegedly being told they would be banned from the classroom otherwise.The Telegraph obtained a copy of the letter sent to parents of children at Hornchurch High School in Havering, in which headteacher Val Mason wrote: “If you do not provide consent your child will not be permitted to return to face-to-face lessons. They will instead be required to complete their work remotely whilst being accommodated on the school site in a separate space.”A parent told the newspaper: “This is coercion bordering on blackmail.

627,"LONDON (AP) – The Vaxi Taxi was a godsend for Leslie Reid.The 48-year-old stagehand wanted to get a COVID-19 shot, but he was worried about riding public transport to the vaccination centre because his immune system had been weakened by a bout with flesh-eating bacteria that almost cost him his arm.So Reid jumped at the opportunity when his doctor called and offered him the shot, together with door-to-door transportation.“I was one of the fortunate ones,”  he said after being inoculated inside a black van cab at a community vaccination event in north London. “I’m sure there are plenty more vulnerable people than me that should have gotten this. What can I say? I’m very glad.”The “Vaxi Taxi” that ferried Reid to his appointment and whisked him home again is just one initiative doctors and community organizers are promoting as they try to make sure everyone gets inoculated. While Britain has engineered one of the world’s most successful coronavirus vaccination programs, delivering at least one dose to more than 30per cent of its population, minority groups and deprived communities are lagging behind.A recent survey commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care found that just 72.5 per cent of black people in England either have received or would accept the vaccine. That compares with 87.6 per cent for Asians and 92.6 per cent for whites.‘Institutional Racism’ to Blame for Vaccine Scepticism Among Ethnic Minorities, Claim UK Health Experts https://t.co/a3gtM1mQP3— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 20, 2021That disparity is the product of a variety of issues ranging from concerns about vaccine safety and alleged past discrimination in Britain’s healthcare system to simple ones like transportation.But community leaders are trying home-grown solutions to fill the gap.Dr Sharon Raymond is one of the activists trying to remove vaccination barriers. The GP and head of the Covid Crisis Rescue Foundation helped organize Sunday’s pop-up vaccination event at Cambridge Gardens, a triangle of grass and trees in a northwest London neighbourhood where half the residents are from ethnic minorities.Her aim was to create an inviting space where people would feel comfortable coming forward to ask questions and discuss their concerns.“It brings it to a place that’s familiar. It becomes much more accessible,” Raymond said. “That’s why this model of bringing the vaccination out to communities in familiar places in an unthreatening way, I think, is the way forward.”So on a chilly, late winter afternoon people got their shots under a heated, bright yellow tent festooned with balloons. Neighbours munched on sandwiches, sipped drinks and stopped to talk to the doctors, nurses and firefighters on hand.Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi praised such local initiatives, describing them as part of a national strategy that aimed to organize uptake down to the postal code. He told The Associated Press that data is showing that people want access to the vaccine at a time of their choice and in a place they trust.“We demonstrated our ability to organize and deploy at scale in the Olympics,” he said with enthusiasm. “This is even bigger. This is the largest vaccination program in the history of the [National Health Service], in the history of United Kingdom. But I do think it’s suited to our DNA on these isles.”And for those who needed a little help to get to the park earlier this week, there was the Vaxi Taxi. People didn’t even need to leave the back seat in order to receive their inoculation if they didn’t want to.Raymond, who has crowd-funded many of her initiatives, hopes to get more support to get iconic black cabs rolling out to help across the capital. Since they have screens, they provide a shield for those inside, are accessible for the disabled and, with few tourists these days, there are plenty of cabbies willing to take part.“This is my vision of London,” Raymond said. “The black cab saves the day!”Sadiq Khan Demands Minorities Get Preferential Access to Coronavirus Vaccines https://t.co/uKn6Pp9YbN— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 19, 2020HealthLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritaincoronavirusCOVID-19LondonpandemicUnited KingdomvaccinationVaccinationsVaccinevaccinesWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
628,"Actor Laurence Fox is standing for election as Mayor of London. Quite what chance he’ll have against the brutal election machine of incumbent Sadiq Khan is hard to say. But even if Fox doesn’t succeed it will have been worth it just for this brilliant, inspirational campaign video.Reclaim London. Reclaim your freedom. pic.twitter.com/6p6Sj92A5p— Laurence Fox (@LozzaFox) March 6, 2021All right, so Fox is an actor – best known, before the world of Luvviedom cancelled him for WrongSpeak, for his role as DS Hathaway in the long-running detective series Lewis – and can convincingly recite a script in one take while walking at the same time. But while the style is a lot more polished than you’d get from almost any politician, what really sets this video apart is the content.Right. Here we go.It’s been a strange twelve months in which we’ve give up so many of our personal freedoms in the name of the common good. Now whether you agree or disagree with how things have been handled the one thing that we can agree on is that we find ourselves here now, today. Not tomorrow and not yesterday, thank God, today. So what are you going to do?Well, I am going to stand to be Mayor of this beautiful city that stands at the heart of this warm, welcoming and tolerant nation. Why? Well, I want to reclaim your freedom. I want to reclaim your freedom to work when you want to work, where you want to work and how you want to work and remove all the obstacles that stand between you and  rebuilding after these lockdowns. And I want to reclaim your freedom to move. To be with whoever you want to be with and when you want to be with them. Your fundamental human need to be together.In sickness and in health. And to never take that freedom away again. Nobody should say their last goodbyes to anybody on an iPad ever again.And importantly I want to reclaim your freedom to speak, to be yourself, to be part of the national conversation, to cherish your history rather than rewrite it. And to teach our children to be confident, not ashamed of who they are or where they’ve come from.London is one of the most diverse cities on earth. Millions of unique and individual voices, a celebration of collaboration. And it is only by working together that we will shape a better tomorrow. So in the coming weeks, I will reveal a common sense plan to get London moving again and restore your freedoms.It’s your life, your freedom. Reclaim it.Sure, some of the fluffy stuff about diversity and tolerance is the usual political pabulum.But the absolute key moment for me is that killer line:Nobody should say their last goodbyes to anybody on an iPad ever again.It’s powerful, it’s angry and it’s true. How many elderly people in the last nightmarish twelve months have died miserable and alone, forbidden from spending their final year in the company of those they love?Almost nothing, it seems to me, embodies the callousness and cruelty of Boris Johnson’s dreadful government quite so much as this: the fact that it has legitimised – indeed legally enforced, even to the point of police brutality – the kind of behaviour which for most of the history of the human race would have been unthinkable. Family have been forbidden from seeing family; friends from seeing friends; the dying from being consoled in their last moments.“On some fond breast the parting soul relies”, wrote Thomas Gray, in his Elegy, Written in a Country Churchyard.For many, it’s the greatest poem ever written because it goes to the heart of so much of the meaning of life and death and the fragility and poignancy of existence.Of course the dying need the comfort of the living. How could anyone allow it to be otherwise?Yet the likes of Mad ‘Messiah Complex’ Matt Hancock, Priapic Malthusian Boris Johnson, and Michael ‘Conscience? What Conscience?’ Gove have driven in a bulldozer right over all that. Almost everything that makes life worth living they have conspired to destroy in the space of a year – insisting all the while that they’re doing it for our own good and for that of “Our NHS” (which apparently we all love more than life itself).And where have been the politicians to call all this out? I would be a lot more impressed with Nigel Farage — who today has announced his retirement from politics — if he’d spoken up against this arbitrary tyranny more often than he did, rather than clapping for the NHS and praising the sinister and despicable Tony Blair and his vaccine programme.So far as I can see, about the only ones speaking out on this issue are the lonely brave Conservative Sir Charles Walker MP, Fox’s fellow mayoral candidate David Kurten (interviewed here), and now Fox himself.I know why, too. There is massive pressure from forces you might call the Deep State – from the corrupt and useless mainstream media, from Big Tech, from Big Pharma from the World Economic Forum, from higher regions of finance, etc – for more lockdowns, more enforced mask-wearing, more restrictions on freedom of movement. Politicians who refuse to push this totalitarian agenda soon find themselves isolated and denied media support and airtime.Fox is a brave, decent man and I wish him all the best.

629,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece will introduce an increase in military service for conscripts serving in the army from nine to 12 months, starting in May, as part of a program to boost the armed forces amid tension with regional rival Turkey.The decision made public Friday will bring army service in line with the length of conscription to the navy and air force.The nine-month term will only remain for army conscripts who volunteer to join special forces services or serve in border areas for their entire term in uniform.Report: Armed Turkish Soldiers Prowling Greek Border in Civilian Dress https://t.co/wAXjaHbjMJ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 31, 2020Greece last year began a major military modernization program that will include the upgrade of its ageing F-16 fighter jet fleet as well as the purchase of new-generation, French-built Rafale jets and a planned frigate order that has drawn keen interest from competing U.S. and European arms makers.Greece and neighbouring Turkey are at odds over sea boundaries and mineral rights in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean, causing a tense naval buildup in the region last year.WATCH: Scenes Resembling First World War as ‘Battle of Evros’ Between Greeks, Migrants, Turks Continues https://t.co/4KFpev54y4— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 25, 2020Israel / Middle EastLondon / EuropePoliticsConscriptionEUEuropean UnionGreeceIslamismislamistsNational ServiceRecep Tayyip ErdoganTurkeyTurkish AggressionTurkish Expansionism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
630,"The Italian migrant transport NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans has been accused of taking €125,000 to transport illegal aliens, with new claims alleging the group initially asked for as much as €270,000.The claims revolve around a ship belonging to the Danish company Maersk which picked up 27 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea in August of last year. The NGO is accused of negotiating a payment to transfer the migrants to its transport vessel, the Mare Jonio, weeks later, on September 11th.In November, Maersk reportedly transferred €125,000 ($151, 000/£108,000) to Idra Social Shipping, the company that owns the Mare Jonio. It is claimed that the money was negotiated before the NGO picking up the migrants and that initially the group had asked for €275,000 ($331,000/£237,000), Il Giornale reports.While neither Maersk nor Idra Social Shipping denies the cash transfer took place, both claim that the money was agreed upon weeks after the migrant transfer and not before.Head of Migrant Transport NGO Under Investigation for People Trafficking https://t.co/ULkq8SXvV7— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 4, 2019Idra Social Shipping stated that the money was agreed to recognise the costs incurred by the Mare Jonio during its mission in the Mediterranean.Italian prosecutors, meanwhile, say that the NGO was looking to profit from picking up the migrants and released information that Beppe Caccia, a board member of the NGO, had been on the phone to a Danish number four times from September 8th to the 10th.The case is not the first time Mediterranea Saving Humans has come under investigation from Italian authorities in recent years. In April of 2019, police interrogated co-founder Luca Casarini regarding allegations that the group helped facilitate illegal migration.Other NGOs picking up migrants in the Mediterranean have also been accused of directly working with traffickers to get migrants to Europe.For example, the German Joint Analysis and Strategy Centre for Illegal Migration (Gasim) stated last July that people-smugglers actively tracked the location of NGO ships off the Libyan coast, saying: “According to refugees and migrants, smugglers used the tracking function on various websites to determine the location of NGO ships and contacted them in individual cases using a satellite phone.”German Authorities Claim People Smugglers Tracking NGO Ships and Directing Migrants to Them https://t.co/Y6tCtwEiUO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 10, 2020CrimeImmigrationLondon / EuropeBoat MigrantsEurope Migrant CrisisHuman TraffickingItalyleft-wing NGOsMass MigrationMediterranea Saving HumansMediterranean migrant routeMigrant BoatsMigrant CrisisNGOsopen borders NGOsPeople smugglers.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
631,"Carbon dioxide emissions need to fall by the equivalent of a lockdown every two years to save the planet, climate scientists have claimed.The claim derives from a paper in the journal Nature Climate Change titled ‘Fossil CO2 emissions in the post-COVID-19 era’.According to the abstract:Five years after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, growth in global CO2emissions has begun to falter. The pervasive disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have radically altered the trajectory of global CO2 emissions. Contradictory effects of the post-COVID-19 investments in fossil fuel-based infrastructure and the recent strengthening of climate targets must be addressed with new policy choices to sustain a decline in global emissions in the post-COVID-19 era.In short, the nations of the world will need to do much, much more if they are to meet the CO2emissions reduction targets set out by the Paris Climate Agreement. This is predicated on the idea that by keeping global industrial CO2emissions below a certain level, mankind will somehow tweak the global temperature control knob to such effect that planetary warming will be kept within a supposedly safe range of “1.5 °C to well below 2 °C.”And in order to achieve this, the report’s lead author Corinne Le Quéré says, there must be the equivalent of a global lockdown every two years.She told the Guardian:We need a cut in emissions of about the size of the fall [from the lockdowns] every two years, but by completely different methods.The lockdown has caused massive disruption to the global economy. According to Bloomberg:Emissions from energy fell by about 2 billion metric tons, or 5.8 per cent in 2020, from the prior year. Such a plunge “is without precedent in human history — broadly speaking, this is the equivalent of removing all of the European Union’s emissions from the global total,” the authors wrote.This was achieved, inter alia, by a huge drop in the air travel which up until 2020 most people had accepted as one of the many perks of Western civilisation. According to the same Bloomberg article, 35 per cent of that drop in energy emissions came from the grounding of most of the world’s aircraft.Perhaps this is why Le Quéré is vague about describing what “completely different methods” might achieve the same effect as lockdown. Whatever they are, they will need to be pretty dramatic — and almost certainly unpopular with people who quite enjoy the trappings of 21st-century life and would rather not be compelled to go back to the Dark Ages. EnvironmentLondon / EuropePoliticsClimate ChangeCorinne Le QuéréGlobal WarminglockdownNature Climate Changepandemictwo years.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
632,"The Turin branch of the leftist ANPI group in Italy has demanded a plaque to the communist-led foibe massacres victims be removed from a memorial garden, calling it “abusive.”The current plaque replaced an older plaque at the garden on the outskirts of Turin. It states: “Garden for victims of Foibe murdered only because they are Italian in Istria, Fiume, and Dalmatia by the communist partisans of Tito. In the vandalism of a few, in the indifference of others, Turin Remembers.”The prior plaque, which had been destroyed several times by vandals, did not mention communism or former Yugoslav communist leader Josip Broz Tito, who led the Partisan movement which perpetrated the foibe massacres.According to a report from the newspaper Il Giornale, the National Association of Partisans in Italy (ANPI) wrote to the local municipality demanding the removal of the new plaque and the restoration of the old one, claiming the new one was abusive.The ANPI also called for an investigation into who put up the new plaque and whether they had the authority to change its language.Italian Far-Left Group Promises ‘Civil Resistance’ Against Salvini Migrant Decree https://t.co/gkgLf5rrOK— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 2, 2018 The foibe massacres took place in former Yugoslavia during and after the Second World War. They saw communist partisans kill as many as 15,000 ethnic Italians, with many thrown alive into natural sinkholes known in Italian as “foibe.”By 1947 as many as 300,000 Italians had been forced to leave the area in former Yugoslavia. While some of the massacres victims were sympathisers of Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, many were just ordinary civilians. In 2004, the government of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi made February 10th a national day of remembrance of the massacres’ victims. Maurizio Marrone, a member of the national conservative Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, reacted with anger over the proposal to remove the Turin plaque, saying: “I wonder if it is not what is written on that plaque that gives so much annoyance.

633,"Iranian military veteran Fariboz Rakei has received a short prison sentence for leading a boatload of migrants, including a seven-year-old child, on a perilous journey across the English Channel.The 49-year-old is one of ten people who have been convicted for offences related to people-smuggling migrants in the Channel so far this year, and has received the longest sentence yet — of just four-and-a-half years.This is despite the fact he is a so-called “boomerang migrant”, having already been deported from Britain to Germany as recently as 2019 following a previous illegal channel crossing, according to KentOnline.Criminals in Britain who receive non-“life” sentences are almost always automatically released early on licence halfway or, more rarely, two-thirds of the way through their terms, too, so the headline figure of four-and-a-half years is not likely to reflect the amount of time he Rakei will actually serve in prison.An Iranian man who risked his own life and those of 12 others – including a seven-year-old boy – by steering an overcrowded boat across the Channel has been jailed for four and a half years. pic.twitter.com/yuQM4Ebl9O— Simon Jones (@SimonJonesNews) March 6, 2021“Steering a vessel like this, for any duration of its journey across the Channel, is a criminal offence that puts lives in danger,” commented the so-called Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, Dan O’Mahoney, who has presided over an increase in illegal boat migrants landings since his job was created.“It is all the worse, when one of those lives is only seven-years-old,” he stressed, pointing out that such voyages “are only possible if someone is willing to pilot the vessel and we want to deter people from taking the helm.”“That is why we will continue to pursue those who do so and ensure that their reckless actions have serious consequences,” O’Mahoney added, as if Rakei’s four-and-a-half term was such a “serious consequence”.English Channel Migrant Numbers Almost Double 2020 Levels https://t.co/On0mWk1ytZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 1, 2021“We are working day and night with French counterparts, including through improved intelligence sharing and increased patrols in northern France, to stop these crossings,” claimed Chris Philp, the government minister responsible for immigration compliance at the Priti Patel-led Home Office.“As this case shows, we are also going after the people involved in facilitating this criminal trade,” he continued, glossing over the shortness of the Iranian’s sentence.“People-smugglers are endangering life. These crossings are not only illegal, but also unnecessary, as France is a safe country with a well-functioning asylum system,” he added.“Furthermore, we are changing our asylum system to make it fair to those who play by the rules, but firm on those who seek to abuse it,” he claimed, years after the crisis in the Channel was first declared a “major incident”.So far this year, Boris Johnson’s government has failed to deport a single illegal boat migrant, despite repeated promises that robust action would finally be taken with the end of the EU “transition” period at the beginning of 2021.ZERO Illegal Boat Migrants Deported Since Brexit Despite Record Arrivals: Report https://t.co/2P45KuVw5n— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2021 ImmigrationLaw and OrderLondon / Europeasylum seekersBoat Migrantsborder controlBritish judgesBritish JudiciaryChannel CrisisChannel MigrantsChris PhilpEurope Migrant Crisishome officeHuman TraffickingIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationIranMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant CrisisMigrantsPeople smugglerspriti patelSoft SentencesUK Border Force.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
634,"The Conservative culture minister has told the institutions trusted with preserving Britain’s cultural heritage not to let themselves be “bullied” by “left-wing campaigns”, as convenors of museums and other spaces come under increasing pressure from Black Lives Matter-inspired activists to unperson historical figures.Britain’s statues, street names, and memorials most recently became targets for damage and destruction by cultural Marxist protesters during and in the wake of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations sparked by the death of George Floyd last year in the United States.Coupled with the wanton vandalism, many administrators of the United Kingdom’s local governments have capitulated to the pressure, commissioning audits of the names of streets, buildings, and other furnishings of public spaces in case they were named after historical figures who may have been in any way connected to slavery, colonialism, empire, or were otherwise accused of racism.Amidst the fervour to erase Britain’s history, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned museums and other institutions entrusted with preserving all shades of the country’s records not to be “pushed around” by left-wing activists, according to The Times.Speaking during the History Matters conference organised by the Policy Exchange think tank, Mr Dowden observed that the phenomenon of pressuring institutions was nothing new and had been going on “for years”, adding that some organisations had even experienced “threats of defunding”.“One of the things that prompted me to come into this debate in the first place was talking to some of the institutions who felt like they were being bullied, particularly by left-wing campaigns,” Mr Dowden said.Warning: contains video footage of a Green councillor putting on an American accent and pretending to be Rosa Parks to persuade other local politicians to vote for reparations (yes, really) https://t.co/UxujhFZMSG— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2021Dowden said: “I think the bigger risk now comes from being pushed around by unrepresentative campaign groups, principally from the left, who put bullying pressure on the institutions to rapidly change their approach, to remove our history, to remove statues and so on in a very short-termist way, not taking a rigorous historical approach and that is a danger that needs to be guarded against because it can take generations to build history and heritage and just a few short-term decisions to remove it, and remove it for good.”Dowden gave a sharp warning to museums and other bodies not to “allow yourself to be pushed around by the zeitgeist, take a longer-term view, make sure you do things in a rigorous way, and understand that your principal duty is to preserve and conserve our heritage”.In June, London’s mayor Sadiq Khan tasked the Orwellian-named Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm to review the city’s landmarks. The board caused controversy after one of its members, Toyin Agbetu, was forced to resign over allegations of antisemitism.Mayor Khan appointed Agbetu to the Commission despite the British-Nigerian activist having attempted to approach Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 during a commemoration ceremony marking Britain’s abolition of the slave trade, where he shouted at the monarch, claimed “the British are the Nazis”, and threatened to “punch out” a black security guard, before being escorted from Westminster Abbey.Asked how he would respond if Khan’s Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm called for the removal of statues of Winston Churchill or Horatio Nelson, Mr Dowden said: “I might even go for one of those preposterous politicians’ sayings, that I would happily chain myself to Nelson to stop him being removed.”While Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s response to the vandalism of Churchill’s statue was initially mealy-mouthed — notably when he claimed that the wartime prime minister “sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today” — his government eventually sought a more robust approach to legally protect statues from removal by left-wing municipal governments.BLM-Inspired Review Targets Statues of Queen Victoria, Rabbie Burns, Nelson, and More in Scottish Capital https://t.co/hMw1oSXyjx— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021In October, the Conservative government announced it was giving Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick a veto over local councils and “Marxist militants” from attempting to remove statues or monuments. The power was seen in action last month when Jenrick blocked the removal of the statue celebrating the life of a British war hero General Sir Redvers Buller.Political commentator Calvin Robinson told Breitbart London at the time: “It’s fantastic to see a conservative policy from this Conservative government. Protecting our statues is of the utmost importance. It’s our job as conservatives to do just that, conserve our past, not just for us, but for future generations.”However, the protections have not stopped local politicians from creating their own blacklists of buildings and statues.

635,"GENEVA (AP) – At a time when seemingly everyone in Europe is wearing masks to battle COVID-19, the Swiss go to the polls Sunday to vote on a long-laid proposal to ban face-coverings, both the niqabs and burqas worn by a few Muslim women in the country and the ski masks and bandannas used by protesters.The issue strikes at the intersection of religious freedom, security, the economy and women’s rights.Critics say the proposal “Yes to a ban on covering the face” is an ironic throwback to a time not long ago when violent extremism was a greater concern than global pandemic, and say it would unfairly stigmatize Muslims who wear full face-covering burqas or niqabs, which have open slits for the eyes, in Switzerland.Proponents, including populist, right-wing movements behind the idea, say it’s needed to combat what they consider a sign of the oppression of women and to uphold a basic principle that faces should be shown in a free society like that of the rich Alpine democracy.Strong Majority of Brits Back Burqa Ban  https://t.co/GpHswMNgGc— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 31, 2018The issue is one of three measures on national ballots in the vote culminating Sunday – most voters in Switzerland cast ballots by mail – as part of the latest instalment of regular Swiss referendums that give voters a direct say in policymaking.Other proposals would create an “e-ID” to improve security of online transactions – an idea that has run afoul of privacy advocates – and a free-trade deal with Indonesia, which is opposed by environmentalists who have concerns about palm oil plantations on the archipelago in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.The face-covering measure has come to be known colloquially as the “burqa ban”. It would put Switzerland in line with countries like Belgium and France that have already enacted similar measures. Two Swiss regions also already have such bans.One campaign poster presented by the Swiss People’s Party — a populist, right-wing party that is the leading faction in parliament and has strongly backed the measure — features a caricatured image of the scowling eyes of a woman in a burqa above the words: “Stop Islamic Radicalism.”A coalition of left-leaning parties have put up signs that read: “Absurd. Useless. Islamophobic.”Guilty: Robbers Using Islamic Burqa Disguise ‘Torture and Kill’ Jeweller  https://t.co/6mlEj72gZ5— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 9, 2018 Support appears to have been eroding, but the vote is expected to be tight. An initial poll for public broadcaster SSR by the gfs.bern agency in January found more than half of voters backed the proposal, but a second poll published on Feb. 24 showed the figures had dipped to under half. Some remain undecided.The Swiss government opposes the measure, arguing that it could crimp economic development: Most Muslim women who wear such veils in Switzerland are visitors from well-heeled Persian Gulf states, who are often drawn to bucolic Swiss lakeside cities. The justice minister insists existing laws work just fine.The measure would make it punishable by fines to cover the face in public in places like restaurants, sports stadiums, public transport, or simply walking in the street — though exceptions are made for religious, security, and health reasons, as well as for the Swiss traditional Carnival celebrations.A counter-proposal would require people to show their faces if requested to do so by authorities.It’s another indication how Switzerland is grappling with security issues and cultures and people from abroad. In the past, Swiss voters have approved a ban on the construction of minarets in the Alpine country whose flag carries the cross.Andreas Tunger-Zanetti, a researcher who heads the Centre for Religious Studies at the University of Lucerne, estimates at most a few dozen Muslim women wear full-face coverings in the country of 8.5 million people, and says the issue is really about Switzerland’s take on religion and ability to “cope with diversity.”Austria, France, Denmark, and More: Europe Rejects the Islamic Burqa https://t.co/RZdi5Zsq0o— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 1, 2018ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsBurkaburka banburqaburqa banCommunity CohesionDirect DemocracydiversityFace Veilface veilsIslamMass MigrationMulticulturalismniqabPopulismradical islamreferendumsSocial CohesionSwiss People's PartySwitzerland.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

637,"From Monday, Britons travelling overseas will have to fill out a government form explaining why they are exempt from coronavirus lockdown restrictions and can leave the country. They must present the declaration for inspection when required, and if unable to could be fined £200.It is currently illegal to travel abroad for holidays or non-essential purposes, and likely until at least May 17th.Home Secretary Priti Patel announced on January 27th the introduction of the declaration form, and the measures will come into force on Monday, March 8th. Britain’s Department of Transport said on Friday that airline carriers will be checking the forms either at check-in or the departure gate, according to Sky News, and that those without the form or a valid reason listed on it could be denied leave to depart.The three-page declaration form for international travel, found on the government website, states that “you must complete this form to confirm that you are outside of your home to travel abroad for a legally permitted reason.”“Legally permitted reasons” for travelling overseas include work, volunteering or educational purposes, medical reasons, on compassionate grounds, and weddings, funerals, and other similar events.Those exempt from filling out the forms for work purposes include bus drivers, aircraft pilots and crew, and those undertaking border security duties.The form explains that “you may be required to present this declaration and asked for any evidence to support your reason for travel at your port of departure”, instructing would-be travellers to keep the form with them as “police may ask to see”.The declaration also warns that giving “false or misleading information” could result in being issued a fine, an order to return home, or even arrest.Aussie Govt: Desperate EU ‘Tearing Up Rule Book’ by Blocking Vaccine Shipment https://t.co/zso9WNBcEg— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2021A Department for Transport spokeswoman told the Daily Mail that “officers will be conducting spot checks and have the power to ask travellers to produce a completed form,” adding: “It will be an offence to fail to produce a completed form and individuals could face a £200 fine.”The British government has already put 33 countries on a red list, meaning that travellers from those nations must be quarantined for ten days in a hotel room — something it steadfastly refused to do in the early stages of the pandemic.Whether coming from a red list nation or not, all travellers coming to Britain must prove a negative coronavirus test no more than 72 hours before entry. If not coming from a red-list country, they must still self-isolate at home or a hotel for ten days, and take two coronavirus tests on days two and eight after arrival.Other governments have also been working on covid-related documentation for international travel, specifically the ‘vaccine passport’, which proves vaccination against the Chinese virus.The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, announced on Monday that it was working on producing a vaccine passport, dubbing it the “Digital Green Pass”, which the Eurocrat said would “gradually enable [EU citizens] to move safely in the European Union or abroad – for work or tourism”.Number 10 Downing Street indicated that it was talking with the EU about the vaccine passports, with a spokesman saying, according to The Telegraph: “We have said that we are looking at the issue of vaccine passports. As you can expect, DfT (the Department for Transport) will work and do speak to countries across the world in terms of how they may look to introduce passports.”“Of course you can expect us to speak to the EU and other countries on how they may implement any similar sorts of policies,” he added.The majority of Germans have said that the European Union has mishandled the rollout of vaccines — a shock result for citizens from the historically pro-EU country. https://t.co/77Me3SB3z4— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownpandemictravelUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
638,"MILAN (AP) — The virus swept through a nursery school and an adjacent elementary school in the Milan suburb of Bollate with amazing speed. In a matter of just days, 45 children and 14 staff members had tested positive.Genetic analysis confirmed what officials already suspected: The highly contagious virus variant first identified in England was racing through the community, a densely packed city of nearly 40,000 with a chemical plant and Pirelli bicycle tire factory a 15-minute drive from the heart of Milan.“This is the demonstration that the virus has a sort of intelligence, even if it is a single-cell organism. We can put up all the barriers in the world and imagine that they work, but in the end, it adapts and penetrates them,” lamented Bollate Mayor Francesco Vassallo.Bollate was the first city in Lombardy, the northern region that has been the epicentre in each of Italy’s three surges, to be sealed off from neighbours because of mutant versions that the World Health Organization says are now powering another uptick in infections across Europe. The variants also include versions first identified in South Africa and Brazil.Europe recorded 1 million new COVID-19 cases last week, an increase of 9 per cent from the previous week and a reversal that ended a six-week decline, WHO said Thursday.“The spread of the variants is driving the increase, but not only,” said Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, citing “also the opening of society, when it is not done in a safe and a controlled manner.”Aussie Govt: Desperate EU ‘Tearing Up Rule Book’ by Blocking Vaccine Shipment https://t.co/zso9WNBcEg— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2021The so-called UK variant is spreading significantly in 27 European countries monitored by WHO and is dominant in at least 10 by the agency’s count: Britain, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Israel, Spain, and Portugal.It is up to 50 per cent more transmissible than the virus that surged last spring and again in the fall, making it more adept at thwarting measures that were previously effective, WHO experts warned.“That is why health systems are struggling more now,” Kluge said. “It really is at a tipping point. We have to hold the fort and be very vigilant.”In Lombardy, which bore the brunt of Italy’s spring surge, intensive care wards are again filling up as more than two-thirds of new positive tests are of the UK variant, health officials said this week.After putting two provinces and some 50 towns on a modified lockdown, Lombardy’s regional governor announced tightened restrictions on Friday and closed classrooms for all age groups. Cases in Milan schools alone surged 33 per cent in a week, the head of the provincial health system said.The situation is dire in the Czech Republic, which registered a record-breaking total of nearly 8,500 patients in the hospital with COVID-19 this week. Poland is opening temporary hospitals and imposing a partial lockdown as the variant has grown from 10 per cent of all infections in February to 25 per cent now.Kluge cited Britain’s experience as cause for optimism, noting that well-considered restrictions and the introduction of the vaccine have helped tamp down the variants there and in Israel. The vaccine rollout in the European Union, by comparison, is lagging, mostly because of supply problems.In Britain, the emergence of the more transmissible strain sent cases soaring in December and triggered a national lockdown in January. Cases have since plummeted, from about 60,000 a day at the peak in early January to about 7,000 a day.Still, a study shows the rate of decline slowing, and the government says it will tread cautiously with plans to ease the lockdown. That process begins Monday with the reopening of schools. Infection rates are highest in people ages 13 to 17, and officials will watch closely to see whether the return to class brings a spike in infections.While the UK variant is dominant in France, forcing lockdowns in the French Riviera city of Nice and the northern port of Dunkirk, the variant first detected in South Africa has emerged as the most prevalent in the Moselle region, which borders German and Luxembourg. It represents 55 per cent of the virus circulating there.The South Africa variant also is predominant in a district of Austria that extends from Italy to Germany, with Austrian officials announcing plans to vaccinate most of the 84,000 residents to curb its spread. Austria is also requiring motorists along the Brenner highway, a major north-south trucking route, to produce negative test results.The South Africa variant, now present in 26 European countries, is a source of particular concern because of doubts over whether the current vaccines are fully effective against it. The Brazilian variant, which appears capable of reinfecting people, has been detected in 15 European countries.WHO and its partners are working to strengthen the genetic surveillance needed to track variants across the continent.The mayor of Bollate has appealed to the regional governor to vaccinate all 40,000 residents immediately, though he expects to be told the supply is too tight at the moment.Bollate has recorded 3,000 positive cases and 134 deaths — mostly among the elderly — since Italy was stricken a year ago. It took the brunt in November and December, in the fall resurgence, and was caught completely off guard when the variant arrived, racing through school-age children before hitting families at home.“People are starting to get tired that after a year there is no light at the end of the tunnel,” Vassallo said.German Vice-Chancellor Reportedly Slams 'Really S***' EU Vaccine Programme https://t.co/GVv3CedxOR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021  HealthLondon / EuropeSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19EUEuropean UnionpandemicvaccinationVaccinationsVaccinevaccinesWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
639,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
640,"The number of foreign criminals living free in communities throughout the United Kingdom has hit a record high, with over 10,000 criminals roaming the streets despite being eligible for deportation.Home Office figures revealed that some 10,373 foreign criminals have been released from prison yet have so far skirted deportation — meaning the number of foreign national offenders living in British communities has hit the highest level in recorded history.While the pandemic has made deportations more difficult, the drop in deportations predates the coronavirus. The number of foreign national offenders remaining in the country has dramatically risen since 2012 when, officially, fewer than 4,000 were living in Britain.In the year leading up to September, only 3,374 criminals were kicked out of the country, representing a drop of a third over the previous year period, The Times reports.Last year, nearly 2,600 foreign criminals were released from prison rather than being deported, meaning that on average seven foreign criminals were set free onto British streets per day.There are also currently around 9,000 foreign national offenders currently imprisoned in the country, accounting for over a tenth of the total prison population.David Spencer, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, told the Daily Mail: “It is an outrage that so many convicted foreign criminals have been left free to roam our streets.”“The Home Secretary [Priti Patel] needs to ensure that, where possible, all foreign criminals are returned to their home country once they have served their time,” he added.The failure to deport foreign criminals has come at a cost in blood. Last year, for example, Libyan national Khairi Saadallah stabbed three men to death in a radical Islamic terror attack just sixteen days after being released from prison.British Govt Failed to Deport 45 Convicted Terrorists After Release From Prison: Report https://t.co/s6p3V4MzeY— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 17, 2020The Home Office has consistently blamed the failure to deport more criminals and illegal aliens on the efforts of “do-gooding” celebrities, protesters, and “activist lawyers”, who have sought to block return flights.In December, 23 criminals were taken off a flight to Jamaica, after human rights lawyers argued that the criminals may be victims of modern slavery. The move came amidst pressure from left-wing politicians, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and over 80 black celebrities and businessmen, including supermodel Naomi Campbell.Home Secretary Priti Patel is reportedly considering to make it easier to deport foreign criminals who are serving shorter prison sentences, by dropping the deportation threshold from twelve-month prison sentences to six.The upcoming Sovereign Borders Bill will also seek to place limits on the ability of foreign criminals to launch last-minute human rights challenges to their deportation.However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shown no interest in leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, upheld by the European Court of Human Rights which still has jurisdiction in Britain despite Brexit.The Convention prohibits the United Kingdom from shipping back criminal migrants to their native countries if it is believed that they will face inhumane treatment in their homeland — no matter whether they present a danger to the public.In February, a British judge stopped the deportation of a double rapist, who posed a “high risk of serious harm” to the public, as it was determined that he would not receive adequate mental healthcare in his home country of Somalia.In June of last year, a Scottish judge also blocked the removal of a Taliban fighter after the terrorist claimed to be suffering Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of fighting for the Islamist terrorist group, and that he would not receive the same quality of taxpayer-funded care in Afghanistan as in Scotland.Judges Block Deportation of Knife Killer Migrant on ‘Human Rights’ Grounds https://t.co/xVLlkMSk8y— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 23, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaCrimeImmigrationLondon / Europeasylum seekersBoris JohnsonBritish Criminal Justice SystemBritish judgesCommunity Cohesioncriminal justice systemdeportationsdiversityEurope Migrant Crisisforeign criminalsForeign National Offendershome officeIllegal AliensImmigrantsJudgesMass MigrationMigrant CrisisMigrantsMulticulturalismpriti patelpublic safetySocial CohesionUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
641,"A review of statues, place names, and other memorials inspired by Black Lives Matter in Edinburgh, Scotland, has figures including Queen Victoria, Admiral Nelson, and even Scotland’s national poet, Robert ‘Rabbie’ Burns, in its sights, according to reports.The Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group, commissioned by the Scottish capital’s municipal government — a coalition between the left-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) and the left-wing Labour Party — has even named Bute House, the official residence of SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, as a site of “historic racial injustice”, according to the Telegraph, because its builders inherited some wealth from Caribbean plantations.Burns, famous around the world as the Bard of Ayrshire, with a statue adorning Central Park in Manhattan, New York, was targeted by the review despite supporting the abolition of slavery because he once “accepted a job working on a Jamaican plantation in a role he described as a ‘Negro driver’” — although he never actually followed through on the job.David Hume, an icon of the Scottish Enlightenment and something of a progressive thinker for his day, has also been singled out for occasionally expressing views that would be considered insensitive by the standards of 2021 — over three centuries on from the year of his birth.

There would be exceptions at religious sites and for security or health reasons, such as the face masks people are wearing now to protect against COVID-19, as well as for traditional Carnival celebrations. Authorities would have two years to draw up detailed legislation.The Swiss government opposes the measure and says that people covering their faces is a “marginal” issue.

To protect the UK, we need a truly diverse workforce that reflects the society we serve,” pronounced the not-a-job-advert, a reproduction of which was published by MailOnline.“This includes diversity in every sense of the word: those with different backgrounds, ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, ways of thinking and those with disabilities or neurodiverse conditions.“We therefore welcome and encourage applications from everyone, including those from groups that are under-represented in our workforce,” the advert adds — before concluding in bold, once again, that it is “only open to those from an ethnic minority background or women from any ethnic background” — so not, in fact, “everyone”.“Following a Registration of Interest period of several weeks, we will open this role for applications. At this stage, applications from candidates of all ethnicities and genders will be welcome,” the advert added.The scheme outraged Philip Davies, a backbench MP on the right of the governing Conservative (Tory) party: “It should be illegal and everybody, apart from obviously the morons at GCHQ, knows white working-class boys are the one category with the worst outcomes in the UK,” he told MailOnline.“Are they really saying they want to give preferential treatment to a black old Etonian or a female public schoolgirl over a white working-class boy?

645,"The grave of Scottish Enlightenment philosopher Adam Smith has become the latest target of a Black Lives Matter-inspired review of sites supposedly linked to “slavery and colonialism” by Edinburgh Council.Adam Smith, known as the “father of capitalism” for his seminal works on economic theory, including The Wealth of Nations, has drawn the ire of the Scottish capital’s local government, a coalition between the left-wing Labour Party and the left-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP).In the wake of Black Lives Matter protests spreading to the United Kingdom after the death of George Floyd in America, the city council launched a review of historical monuments, place names, and other memorials for “removal or re-interpretation” over alleged links to “racism and oppression”.On Saturday, The Telegraph reported that Smith’s grave in Edinburgh’s Canongate Kirkyard, as well as his statue on the Royal Mile, have been added to the list of sites tied to “historical racial injustice”, despite the fact that the 17th-century Enlightenment thinker expressed opposition to the use of slave labour.Documents seen by the paper said that Smith was included in the woke review because he “argued that slavery was ubiquitous and inevitable but that it was not as profitable as free labour”.However, nearly fifty years before the abolition of slavery, Smith wrote in is 1759 work The Theory of Moral Sentiments in regards to the African slave trade: “Fortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when she subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the jails of Europe”.The father of economics also argued that slave owners should be held in moral “contempt” by their slaves as well as that the economic system of slavery was less efficient than a system of voluntary exchange of capital and labour.Responding to the latest attacks on British heritage, Robert Poll of the Save Our Statues campaign told Breitbart London: “Edinburgh’s statue review is out of control — severely lacking in due process, balance and expertise — and a sad illustration of what happens when we rush to hand over editorial control of our history to activists.“Smith was a titan of Scotland’s Enlightenment and that his views can be so quickly and wrongly reinterpreted shows the risk currently hanging over our history.”BLM-Inspired Review Targets Statues of Queen Victoria, Rabbie Burns, Nelson, and More in Scottish Capital https://t.co/hMw1oSXyjx— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021Historian Sir Tom Devine also argued against the historical inaccuracy of linking Smith with the injustices of the slave trade.“I strongly take the view that the ‎Edinburgh City Council wording is ludicrously biased and distorted by giving the impression that Adam Smith accepted slavery as a fact of life, and so was not reprehensible,” Sir Tom said.“It is abundantly clear from his Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue and Arms, several years before abolitionism took off, that he believed slavery to be evil and inhumane,” he added.Sir Tom said that while he would be in favour of using “rigorous and impartial historical evidence” to give context to monuments, he noted that: “Edinburgh City Council does not have an acceptable track record in this regard.”The council’s review has also been revealed to have targeted the statue honouring the Battle of Waterloo hero and prime minister the Duke of Wellington, accusing him of having “supported West India interests” and being pro-slavery — despite his government using the Royal Navy to help stamp out the trade after abolition.The review has previously been reported to be targeting monuments celebrating Queen Victoria and Admiral Nelson, as well as Scotland’s national poet, Robert ‘Rabbie’ Burns.Last year, Edinburgh University removed the name of 18th century Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume from one of its buildings over his now politically incorrect opinions.In February, the country’s oldest museum, the University of Glasgow’s Hunterian Museum, announced the creation of a “curator of discomfort” to address historical and modern “white supremacy”.UK’s Natural History Museum to Review ‘Offensive’ Charles Darwin Exhibits, Bowing to BLM Pressure https://t.co/SaChhCuVFM— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 8, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeAdam SmithAdmiral Lord NelsonBlack Lives MatterBritainBritish cultureBritish HistoryCommunity CohesionDavid HumeedinburghEdinburgh CouncilHeritageHistoryIconoclasmlabourLabour Partyleft-wing academicsMulticulturalismQueen VictoriaRobert BurnsscotlandScottish HistoryScottish National PartyScottish National Party (SNP)SJWsSNPSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorsstatue warsstatuesUKBLMUnited KingdomWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

647,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces opposition from amongst his own Conservative MPs over the government’s recommendation that children wear masks in classrooms if they cannot socially distance, with leading backbencher Sir Graham Brady warning it will cause psychological damage and disrupt learning.British children are set to return to school on Monday, with secondary school pupils (aged 11 to 18) recommended to wear masks where social distancing is not possible, including possibly in the classroom. Secondary school children will also be asked to take three ‘lateral flow’ tests at school and two every week at home, involving swabbing the back of the throat and also the inside of the nose.The Telegraph reported on Thursday that 32 Conservative MPs are calling for the mask recommendations in classrooms to be dropped after the Easter holidays. In a letter written by MPs to the Prime Minister, the lawmakers said that it was “just not good enough” to impose the measures on millions of children.The letter was signed by Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, which consists of all backbench Conservative MPs (those who hold no governmental roles). It was also signed by members of the lockdown sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG), including Brexiteer Steve Baker.Sir Graham told The Telegraph that “requiring children to wear masks in the classroom will damage their education and inhibit their communication with teachers and with their peers.”Children Without Masks Will Be Segregated, Use Separate Entrances: Report https://t.co/dP38sde5x4— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 4, 2021“The psychological damage being done to young people who need to see each others’ faces to communicate with each other is immense,” the senior backbencher said.“By the time schools come back after Easter we should be able to look forward to a very low risk environment and a sensible reduction in Covid measures,” he added.Department for Education (DfE) officials have said that “no pupil should be denied education on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering”.However, reports have claimed that some schools allegedly threatened to order children who do not wear masks to go home and get one.One London school allegedly told parents that “students who repeatedly come into school without a face mask may be asked to return home to retrieve one”, while another city school said maskless children must “wait outside” until a mask is brought to them, or they will likewise have to go home to get one.Parents have also allegedly been told that their children could be asked to use separate entrances and be segregated from their friends at lunch, as well as be barred from group activities like drama, sports, or after-school clubs if they do not wear a mask.Majority of Britons Said They Would MISS Lockdown https://t.co/n0jjcQjOhS— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2021 EducationLondon / EuropeScience1922 CommitteeChildrencoronavirusCOVID-19Graham BradymaskspandemicschoolsUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
648,"BRUSSELS (AP) – Europe’s vaccine solidarity got a shot in the arm Friday as France rallied to support Italy, saying it could follow suit in blocking exports of coronavirus vaccines outside the European Union if necessary to enforce its own contracts with drugs manufacturers.The European Union defended the Italian authorities’ decision to stop a large shipment of doses destined for Australia as part of a longstanding feud with drug manufacturer AstraZeneca.The EU’s executive Commission said the decision was not targeting Australia but had been taken to ensure that AstraZeneca delivers the number of doses it committed to dispatch to EU countries.“The fact is that the European Union is a major exporter of vaccine doses,” EU Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer said Friday.Faced with a shortages of doses during the early stages of the vaccine campaign that started in late December, the EU announced the export control system for COVID-19 vaccines in late January, in a bid to force companies to respect their contractual obligations to the bloc first.Since the mechanism entered into force on Jan. 30, the Commission said that 174 authorizations of vaccine exports to 30 different countries outside the EU have been approved.EU Blocks Vaccine Shipment to Australia: Report https://t.co/qrkYFrLTT3— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2021But the EU has been particularly upset by AstraZeneca because the company is delivering far fewer doses to the bloc than it had promised. Of the initial order for 80 million doses to the EU in the first quarter this year, the company will be struggling to deliver half that quantity.“We believe that this vaccine is an important element of our portfolio and we therefore are expecting the delivery of the agreed doses,” Mamer said. “We are working with the companies in order to ensure that they deliver the doses that are foreseen for the European Union. For all those companies that are doing that, there are no problem with exports.”As serum supplies remain scarce in the 27-nation region amid delays in deliveries and production issues, European countries have shown signs of divisions recently, with several countries expressing their frustration over the slow rollout of doses and looking for extra supply of vaccines outside of the joint procurement set up by the EU,But Italy’s decision to block the shipment of more than 250,000 AstraZeneca doses destined for Australia closed ranks between member states. French health minister Olivier Veran said he “understood” the Italian’s government decision and indicated France “could do the same.”“Believe me, the more doses I have, the happier I am as health minister,” Veran said in an interview with BFMTV channel, adding that France and its European partners are determined to have their contracts with drugmakers enforced.The EU thought it had made excellent preparations for the rollout of vaccines to its 450 million people. It has signed deals for six different vaccines. In total, it has ordered up to 400 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and sealed agreements with other companies for more than 2 billion shots.But only 33 million doses have been given so far, and only 11 million Europeans have been fully vaccinated. Despite the current difficulties, the EU’s goal remains to vaccinate 70% of the adult population in the bloc by the end of summer.The Italian’s government move marked the first use of the export control system, It frustrated the Australian government, which is seeking assurances from the EU’s executive arm that future shipments of vaccines will not be blocked,“The world is in uncharted territory at present, it’s unsurprising that some countries would tear up the rule book,” Australian Finance Minister Simon Birmingham told Sky News Australia on Friday. Birmingham acknowledged, however, that Australia received 300,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last week, and “that will see our current distribution plan work.”Australia’s immunization program began last month and the government expects the vaccine will be made available to anyone who wants it by October. The country has secured 53.8 million doses of the vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, 50 million of which will be made in Australia in a partnership with Melbourne-based biopharmaceutical company CSL.Aussie Govt: Desperate EU ‘Tearing Up Rule Book’ by Blocking Vaccine Shipment https://t.co/zso9WNBcEg— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 5, 2021HealthLondon / EuropePoliticsAstraZenecaAustraliaBritish CommonwealthcoronavirusCOVID-19Emmanuel MacronEUEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionFranceItalyMacronpandemicvaccinationVaccinevaccinesWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
649,"The city council of Bristol has approved a motion calling for reparations for slavery as an act of “atonement” for the British port city’s role in the slave trade.The Labour Party-run council passed the motion by a margin of 47 votes to 12 on Tuesday following a zoom meeting of the councillors. The council agreed to implement “community wealth creation strategies” and to write to the British Parliament demanding the establishment of a commission to determine “how reparations may be delivered”.In a peculiar act of so-called cultural appropriation, Cleo Lake — the Green Party councillor who led the motion — called upon the other members to support reparations by “representing” as US civil rights leader Rosa Parks in a mock American accent.“I believe we are here on this Earth to live, grow, and to do what we can to make the world a better place for all people to enjoy,” she said in a put-on accent while quoting Ms Parks.In a statement, the Bristol city council said that racial injustice today is a byproduct of “economic injustice or domination of the global economy established in the seventeenth century,” and therefore “efforts need to be made to expedite the atonement process, and work needs to be done to achieve holistic reparations.”The left-wing council went on to say that “reparative justice should be driven by Afrikan Heritage Communities experiences, voices and perspectives to ensure that advocacy messages not only reflect but also respond to the real needs of the community in order to recognise inequalities.”WATCH: ‘Reparationist’ Calls for Creation of ‘Pan-African Superstate’ at Extinction Rebellion Rally https://t.co/BOvvlPTgl6— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 5, 2020In response to the reparations push, Robert Poll of the Save Our Statues campaign told Breitbart London: “This is straight from the Critical Race Theory playbook, perpetuating a simplistic and divisive victim/aggressor narrative. It’s a misrepresentation both of history and of the people of Bristol. Nobody today is guilty. Nobody today is a victim.”A senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think tank, Calvin Robinson, added that Bristol has become “the first city in the UK to go entirely woke.”“There’s a clear misunderstanding amongst Bristol politicians. People are struggling because of a whole host of socio-economic issues; an attempt to put the blame on race is narrow-minded and short-sighted. They’d do far better to look at the class disparity in the city,” Robinson told Breitbart London.“The idea of reparations in the 21st century to somehow make-up for atrocities of the 16th/17th century is beyond ridiculous. Whose money are they suggesting we use to pay reparations, and who are they suggesting reparations are paid to?” he questioned.Mr Robinson who has himself been the target of left-wing racism and even called a “race traitor” for being a black man espousing conservative views, noted that “there is no such thing as government money” and reparations would, in fact, be paid by the British taxpayer.“The idea that I am somehow owed monetary compensation for something my ancestors may or may not have experienced is lunacy. Would all brown people by eligible? The way our tax system works, that would mean relatively poor black people would be paying reparations to rich black people, it’s nonsensical,” he proclaimed.Mr Robinson said that the reparations push from the Bristol council is just another attempt at “virtue signalling from the woke elites,” adding: “The British Government apologised for its hand in the slave trade, it is our job as a Christian nation to accept that apology and move on. Let’s look forward, not backwards.”Black Lives Matter Figure Replaces Toppled Colston Statue in Bristol https://t.co/SZjHfdekg6— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 16, 2020Bristol was one of the United Kingdom’s top slave port cities during the 1700s. The city has in recent decades become a hotbed of left-wing activism, with Black Lives Matter vandals toppling the statue of British philanthropist and parliamentarian Sir Edward Colston last June for his role in the slave trade.While Great Britain did play a role in the slave trade, it became the first country in the world to abolish slavery.Following the passage of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the Royal Navy embarked on a campaign to end the practice, capturing an estimated 1,600 slave trade ships, and freeing some 150,000 African slaves in the process.Between 1830 and 1865 some 1,587 British sailors lost their lives in their fight against slavery.Calvin Robinson questioned whether the Bristol city council would recognise Britain’s efforts to stamp out the slave trade, proposing a statue in honour of William Grenville, who introduced the Slave Trade Act of 1807.WATCH: XR and BLM Activists Demand Reparations During ‘Walk of Shame’ Protest in the City of London https://t.co/APj5JOdNGf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 7, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeBlack Lives Matter UKBristolBritish HistoryCalvin RobinsonEdward ColstonLabour PartyreparationsSave Our StatuesSlave TradeSlaverySlavery ReparationsUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
650,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak has said the furlough scheme was extended because “things might change”, suggesting that Britain might not see the full lifting of coronavirus restrictions by June 21st.On Wednesday, Mr Sunak announced an extension of the furlough scheme beyond the end of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “roadmap” for taking the country out of lockdown.Asked on Thursday why the salary compensation scheme was renewed three months beyond the prospective end of lockdown, Sunak told Good Morning Britain: “We did that for a couple of reasons. I wanted people to have the reassurance that we were going long, beyond the end of the roadmap, because, of course, things might change.“We wanted to accommodate even the most cautious view of exiting the restrictions.“Now, hopefully, that won’t happen, and we’re making great progress and thanks to everyone involved in the vaccination drive for making that possible.”The finance minister added: “But it is also important to remember that, just because the restrictions end, businesses will still need to take time to recover.“Things will take a bit of time to get back to the way they were, so I think it is important to provide that extra cushion.”Majority of Britons Said They Would MISS Lockdown https://t.co/n0jjcQjOhS— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2021Last week, the prime minister outlined five key dates for the staged lifting of restrictions, starting with schools opening on March 8th, along with two people from different households being allowed to socialise, and a full lifting of all measures by June 21st.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said recently that he was confident of the June lifting and was “optimistic for a great British summer”.He added: “I’m now more optimistic about having a great British summer than I have been at any time, thanks to the speed and the effectiveness of the vaccine rollout.”There have been concerns raised in recent months of when England’s third lockdown would be lifted. When Prime Minister Johnson announced the shutdown on January 4th, he did not give an end date, with successive remarks putting the possible release of society later and later in the year.Last month, Chancellor Sunak even reportedly said that he was “concerned” that public health officials and government scientific advisors were “moving the goalposts” of the Johnson administration’s COVID-19 response tactics in order to justify keeping the country under lockdown.“The most worrying thing I find about the whole last year is the enthusiasm with which people have embraced the diminution of their civil liberties and their ordinary lives.""  https://t.co/cI6hPvc7er— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2021London / EuropePoliticsScienceChancellor of the ExchequercoronavirusCOVID-19furloughfurloughed workerslockdownpandemicRishi SunakUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
651,"Global industrial carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 suffered their biggest drop since the Second World War but then bounced back in the final month, according to the latest data from the International Energy Agency.This ought to be good news — a sign of the global economy’s resilience despite the various Covid clampdowns which caused CO2 emissions in the U.S. and the EU to plummet in March, April and May 2020 by 10 per cent. Emissions from energy fell by about two billion metric tons, a plunge which the IEA’s authors say is ‘without precedent in human history’ and is the rough equivalent of ‘removing all of the European Union’s emissions from the global total’.But the IEA is spinning it as a bad thing: a sign that we are not doing enough to cut our ‘carbon’ emissions. Note, for example, the tone of this tweet from the IEA’s Executive Director Fatih Birol.This morning we released the latest IEA data on global CO2 emissions trends.Don't miss this thread from our Executive Director @fbirol running through the key findings 👇 https://t.co/NMyztKppNF— International Energy Agency (@IEA) March 2, 2021Many countries talk a good game on their intentions to reduce carbon emissions. But according to the United Nations, few are prepared to put their money where their mouth is.The Times (of London) reports that in the run-up to the COP26 climate summit, hosted this year by the United Kingdom, only the UK and the European Union have submitted CO2-reduction plans.Only two of the world’s 18 largest greenhouse gas emitters — the UK and the European Union — have so far submitted plans for the COP26 summit that lay out extensive commitments and policies to reduce emissions. Other big emitters are either yet to submit updated strategies or have drafted plans that are too weak to achieve the 2015 Paris climate target of limiting global temperature rise to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.“This report shows that current levels of climate ambition are very far from putting us on a pathway that will meet our Paris agreement goals,” Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN climate change body, said. “While we acknowledge the recent political shift in momentum towards stronger climate action, decisions to accelerate and broaden climate action everywhere must be taken now.”Later in the article, Alok Sharma — the UK minister acting as COP26 president — describes this as ‘an urgent call to action.’ Well of course he would. This is what they always say in the run-up to COP meetings: that more needs to be done and the case for reducing CO2 emissions is stronger than ever before.In reality, as before, some countries — such as Boris Johnson’s green-obsessed UK  administration — will commit unilateral suicide by promising CO2 reductions their economies can ill afford. Others are likely to be more circumspect about hobbling their economic growth in the name of green virtue signalling. The Times goes on to report for example that ‘Japan, South Korea, Russia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Australia [have] submitted plans that failed to improve on their 2015 targets.’One thing is for certain — while Western nations such as the UK and, likely, President Biden’s USA submit their economies to ruinous ‘decarbonisation’ programmes, the new generation of world economic leaders such as China, India and Brazil will continue to prioritise growth over greenery.This chart makes a point that the West should heed:Major economies led the rebound in CO2 emissions, with China, India & Brazil all above 2019 levels by the end of 2020 and the US approaching them.Emissions growth was propelled by the global economic recovery & a lack of clean energy policies ➡️ https://t.co/3KVyguWgnJ pic.twitter.com/toOmSPN5Ox— International Energy Agency (@IEA) March 2, 2021By the end of 2020, China, Brazil and India were all back in business – producing CO2 emissions (a useful metric for economic growth since it is a by-product of every industrial process) in excess of those they had emitted the previous year.The U.S., on the other hand, was still catching up.London / Europecarbon dioxideCO2COP26Covideconomic growthInternational Energy Agency.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
652,"Priti Patel’s Home Office has reportedly failed to launch a single deportation flight for illegal migrants since the United Kingdom officially left the European Union’s institutions at the beginning of the year.So far this year, a record 587 boat migrants have been brought ashore by the authorities, with 66 illegals landing on Tuesday. This is over double the number that landed during the same time period last year, which stood at 246, according to the BBC.Following Brexit, the United Kingdom amended its immigration laws, meaning that migrants can no longer claim asylum if they were either intercepted at sea or are found to have passed through a safe third country prior to coming to Britain.Despite this, the Home Office under the leadership of Priti Patel has yet to carry out any flights to deport the hundreds of migrants that have landed this year, The Telegraph reports.The EU’s Dublin agreement on the return of migrants expired following the end of the 2020 “transition” period in which the UK remained an EU member in all but name. Since then, the government has failed to come to an agreement with the European Union over the return of failed asylum seekers or illegal migrants, and is still not turning them back on its own initiative.The Telegraph claimed that the negotiations are currently ongoing, but there has been no indication that a deal is imminent.If an agreement were to be reached, it is still unclear as to how effective it would be, as many migrants destroy their personal documents prior to attempting to reach Britain illegally, also making it difficult to persuade their native country to take them back.The Boris Johnson administration also has expressed no intention of leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, upheld by the European Court of Human Rights which still has jurisdiction in Britain.This prohibits sending migrants back to their countries if they are likely to suffer from torture or other inhumane treatment, even if they are terrorists, sexual predators, or otherwise present a danger to the public.UK Deportations of Foreign Criminals Fell 79 per cent Last Year, Despite Patel’s Promises to ‘Get Tough’ https://t.co/5PazItcV8R— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 19, 2021“Despite Government efforts, such as they are, the situation gets worse.

The French too must deal more effectively with the problem at their end and stop escorting illegal immigrants into British waters.”A Home Office spokesman simply repeated that with Brexit, the United Kingdom is no longer bound by the “EU’s Dublin Regulation which was rigid, inflexible and often abused by meritless claims that would effectively time out the process.”“The UK will continue to seek to return people who have no right to be here and arrive in the UK through illegally-facilitated crossings,” the spokesman added, failing to acknowledge the fact that this is not actually happening.Report: Glasgow Stabber 'Very Hungry' Sudanese Man, Migrants Unhappy with 'Culturally Inappropriate' Spaghetti, Mac and Cheese Meals at Hotel https://t.co/uFjJ9zGfJh— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 27, 2020The report also revealed that the former military barracks turned migrant camp in Folkestone, Kent, has cost the British taxpayer nearly £1 million to police since opening in September of last year.Amid record-breaking illegal boat migration last year, the Home Office began housing migrants, some of whom were lethally violent, in hotels across the country.As the waves of illegal migrants continued to pour into the country, the government began using former military bases, such as the Napier Barracks in Kent, to accommodate the overflowing migrant population.The government’s policing minister, Kit Malthouse, granted Kent Police some £850,000 to cover the costs of policing the asylum seekers in the camp.Migrants in the camp have staged several protests and hunger strikes since their arrival, necessitating a police presence to monitor the situation.In January, a fire broke out in the camp, with 14 of the migrants being arrested in connection to the suspected arson attack.Illegal Migrants Unhappy with Free Accommodation in 'Racist' UK Want to Return to EU https://t.co/xBqAni6Zct— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaImmigrationLondon / EuropeAlp Mehmetasylum seekersBoat MigrantsChannel CrisisChannel MigrantsdiversityEnglish ChannelEurope Migrant CrisisFolkestonehome officeIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationIllegal MigrantsMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant Campmigrant campsMigrant CrisisMigrant Hotelsmigration watchMigration Watch UKMulticulturalismNigel Faragepriti patelSocial CohesionUK Border ForceUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
653,"We had expected Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak to deliver the Magic Money Tree but what he has actually delivered is a Cloud Cuckoo Land budget. Really, you don’t need to be a Goldman-Sachs-trained economist to realise that the numbers just don’t add up and that this is a stop-gap, smoke-and-mirrors exercise to fool us into imagining that the UK economy is not on the brink of total disaster.Sure, during his lonely speech, delivered to an almost empty chamber, Sunak dropped some heavy hints that all was not well.Sunak said: “It is going to be the work of many governments over many decades to [pay the money borrowed] back”, and just a one per cent increase in interest rates and inflation now would increase the cost of the government’s debts by £25 billion at a stroke.But the impression given was that with a bit of tinkering here and there – ‘special economic zones’, ‘bounce back loans’, ‘restart grant’ etc – we will all somehow muddle through.We won’t.The elephants in the room are, of course, the SAGE and NERVTAG (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) committees, which have assumed the role of Britain’s unelected government.As Chancellor, Sunak ought by rights to have a much bigger say in the direction of Britain’s economy than, say, Neil Ferguson (aka Professor Pantsdown) whose heroically pessimistic and discredited Imperial College coronavirus pandemic computer model first got us into this mess; or than, say, Susan Michie, the behavioural expert and Communist mostly cushioned from the effects of her own proposed policies thanks to the £50 million she shared with her siblings in 2019 when they sold a Picasso inherited from their mother.But in fact, as we’ve seen in the last twelve months, it’s these unaccountable scientific advisory groups that have made all the running in dictating Britain’s seemingly endless series of lockdowns.In the early days of the pandemic last year, Sunak was known to be the senior minister most opposed to lockdown and the keenest to get the economy up and running again. Back then, he was overruled by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove and Health Secretary Michael Gove. Now it looks like he has pretty much resigned himself to the inevitable. His announcement that the Furlough payments — i.e. the methadone drip which keeps all the people made unemployed by the lockdown vaguely appeased and semi-content — will be extended into September looks less like the light at the end of the tunnel and more like an oncoming train.More and more states in the U.S. are abandoning mask mandates and opening up for business. Sunak, who was a Fulbright scholar at Stanford, must be looking across the pond with envy. But as just about the only voice of resistance at senior level in the Boris Johnson administration, there’s precious little he can do to avert the inevitable disaster.And it is inevitable.Britain has suffered its biggest economic collapse in over three hundred years — since the Great Frost of 1709 when the Thames froze over. Sure, its economy might have bounced back under a government with any appetite to put people and business and jobs and freedom and education and cultural survival and decency and common sense before the draconian ordinances of an unelected body of activist scientists. Unfortunately, with the hopeless Boris Johnson at the helm, it simply hasn’t got one of those governments.So Sunak had to make the best with the very feeble material he has been given. It helps that he has a tame Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), predicting that the economy will grow this year by 4 per cent, by 7.3 per cent [yeah right] in 2022, then 1.7 per cent, 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in the last three years of the forecast. It also helps that he has a vivid imagination, which allows him to pretend that ‘more than 700,000 people have lost their jobs since last March’ – when he must surely know that the real unemployment figures (which the furlough is concealing) already run into the millions.As for the budget itself — well it’s clear that Sunak has learned a lesson from his most Machiavellian predecessor, the dark lord ‘George’ Gideon Osborne, that if you keep moving those cups round fast enough when you play the shell game no one will be able to spot where you’ve hidden the pea — or indeed have lost the pea altogether because you are totally broke and your creditors took it as collateral.So, for the moment, he hasn’t actually — as was feared — raised income tax directly. He’s just done it indirectly by freezing personal allowances, thus bringing more people into the higher tax brackets within the next few years, especially as Britain heads towards the racing certainty of galloping inflation.As a bread and circuses sop to us proles, he has abandoned a mooted hike in duty on booze, and on fuel too. (Let’s see how long that lasts: Boris’s green government LOATHES car drivers, for a start).And though he has increased Corporation Tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, he has attempted to maintain the illusion that his government is pro-business with another fancy-pants wheeze called a ‘super deduction’ incentive for businesses to invest.The new rule would allow companies to reduce their tax bill by 130 per cent when making capital purchases — as Sunak said, a construction firm buying £100 million of new equipment could reduce its tax liability by £130 million.Maybe this will work. Maybe it won’t. But it certainly won’t impress those of us who believe government’s job is to get out of the way of business rather than try to micromanage it with endless taxes and subsidies, as though the state knows better than entrepreneurs how to do their job.The other major disappointment is that this budget extends the Conservatives’ track record of raising the national tax burden to ever greater heights. Even before the Chinese Coronavirus pandemic, taxes were at their highest levels since the 1960s. This latest budget — according to Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies — takes taxes to ‘their highest sustained level in history.’We might have expected this under the leadership of a neo-Marxist such as former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. I don’t think many of us realised that it would happen under a Prime Minister who once wrote in a column that ‘voting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts and increase your chances of owning a BMW’.

654,"At least eight people are reported injured after an unknown man went on a stabbing rampage in the municipality of Vetlanda before being shot by local police in what officers are calling a suspected terrorist attack.The incident took place just after 3 pm on Wednesday afternoon and saw a man, reportedly in his 20s, attack several people on the Bangårdsgatan road in the centre of the town of Vetlanda.Initial reports claimed that four people had been injured in the incident, which saw the man attack others with a knife, but local police confirmed that a total of eight people had been injured by the attacker, newspaper Aftonbladet reports.Police shot the attacker during the incident but his exact condition remains unclear, with police press spokesman Thomas Agnevik confirming only that the attacker is alive and has been rushed to a local hospital to treat his injuries.Agnevik spoke to broadcaster SVT saying, “His injury situation is unclear, but he is in hospital and was alive when he got there.” He also noted that at least one of the victims of the attack had been seriously injured.A terrorist motive has not been ruled out by the Swedish security police Sapo, whose press officer Karl Melin told the newspaper, “We are cooperating with the police and if it turns out that this is a terrorist crime, we will be more involved. When it comes to suspected terrorist crime, it is normal the security police are the ones who investigate it.”As the location of the attack was near a local train station, authorities have also stopped the local train service.The incident comes just days after chief prosecutor of Sweden’s National Security Case Unit Per Lindqvist warned that the country could become a safe haven for terrorists due to the country’s terror laws, which are much less strict than other European Union member states.Sweden’s last major terror attack, which occurred in Stockholm’s Drottninggatan shopping district in April of 2017, saw failed asylum seeker Rakhmat Akilov murder five people, including 11-year-old Ebba Akerlund, and injuring 14 more when he drove a hijacked truck through a pedestrian area.Law and OrderLondon / EuropeMass StabbingSwedenterrorismTerrorist attackVetlanda.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
655,"The British government is reportedly planning to make vaccines for the Chinese coronavirus mandatory for healthcare workers, in a move described by unions as “sinister”.Amid reports of vaccine refusal among some segments of Britain’s socialised healthcare system, the National Health Service (NHS), the government is said to be considering forced inoculations for healthcare staff.The government is currently reviewing plans that would see healthcare workers forced to take the vaccine or face exclusion from vaccine passport eligibility, the Daily Mail reported.“It is extraordinary that so many people in the health sector appear to have turned down the vaccine,’ a Cabinet source told the paper.A government spokesman added: “While it is for Government and parliament to decide which groups of people are required to get the vaccine, the NHS national medical director and chief nurse agree with Chris Whitty, with the chairman of the BMA and other professional leaders that NHS staff have a duty to be vaccinated unless they have a valid clinical reason not to do so.”These NHS staff were told the swine flu vaccine was safe, and now they're suffering the consequences https://t.co/9ayUUnQRDS pic.twitter.com/x3G5T28XlE— BuzzFeed UK (@BuzzFeedUK) February 24, 2018Though the government is said to be reticent to fire healthcare workers who refuse the jab, they may instead opt to demote the staff to non-front line positions.The plans have sparked widespread backlash, considering the fact that the government has consistently claimed that vaccinations in Britain will be voluntary.The general secretary of Unison, a leading NHS union, Christina McAnea said: “Forced vaccinations are the wrong way to go, and send out a sinister and worrying message.”“Encouragement and persuasion rather than threats and bullying are key to a successful programme, as ministers themselves have repeatedly indicated. Mandatory jabs are counterproductive and likely to make those who are hesitant even more so. This will do nothing to help health and care sectors that are already chronically understaffed,” she added.COVID-1984: European Union Officially Announces Vaccine Passport Scheme, UK May Join https://t.co/sZTVKW4Gn4— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021The government has also previously denied that it would roll out a vaccine passport for people domestically, for example to go to the pub or the supermarket.However, a review of how to implement such a scheme is currently being undertaken by Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who expressly shot down the idea in December. The forced vaccination scheme for healthcare workers is reportedly being considered as a part of the review.On Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: “It is clear that we will need to provide people with the ability to certify whether they have had the jab. And we will need to absolutely take into consideration those who have a certified clinical reason why they can’t have the jab.”Some 200,000 NHS and care home employees are believed to have refused to take the vaccine across the country.While this means that over 90 per cent of all healthcare workers have had the injection, the number in certain localities is much lower, particularly in London where nearly a quarter of NHS workers have turned down the jab, despite having priority access.The government has reportedly been concerned with a hesitancy among so-called BAME (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic) groups to take the vaccine.A review carried out last month at the Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London found that only a quarter of black and Filipino staff had taken the vaccine,  as compared to 80 per cent of staff as a whole.Quarter of London NHS Staff Have Refused to Take Coronavirus Vaccines https://t.co/x6wn48zJ7J— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropePoliticscoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineCOVID-19National Health ServiceNHSNursesUnited KingdomVaccinevaccine passportVaccine Passportsvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
656,"British prime minister Boris Johnson has posted a picture of himself posing with a copy of a Dr Seuss story for World Book Day, amid an ongoing culture war battle over whether the late children’s author should be “cancelled”.“Over the long days of lockdown, reading has provided great relief to so many,” the Prime Minister wrote in a post shared on Facebook-owned Instagram, showing him masked up and reading a copy of The Cat in the Hat to an unmasked girl in school uniform.“On World Book Day and with schools returning in England on Monday, there has never been a better time to pick up a good book and get reading!” he added, tagging the post with the hashtags #WorldBookDay, #reading, and #CatInTheHat.While a seemingly innocuous message, the post comes at a time when Dr Seuss, until recently one of America’s most beloved children’s authors, finds himself at the centre of a posthumous woke firestorm, with U.S. President Joe Biden dropping him from Read Across America Day and his own company announcing it will cease publication of six of his works for their allegedly “racist and insensitive imagery”.A post shared by Boris Johnson (@borisjohnsonuk)Dr Seuss Enterprises that the six books by the author whose legacy they are supposed to preserve “portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong”, and vowed that “Ceasing sales of these books is only part of our commitment and our broader plan to ensure Dr Seuss Enterprises’ catalogue represents and supports all communities and families.”The demonisation of Dr Seuss — real name Theodor Seuss Geisel — is a relatively new development, however, with incumbent vice president Kamala Harris having wished the late writer and illustrator a happy birthday as recently as 2017.Former president Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama also hosted a special Dr Seuss-themed event at the White House in 2009 in partnership with the National Education Association, declaring that his “beloved” books “still inspire children throughout the world to read”.Then-President Obama is also said to have told interns that “pretty much all the stuff you need to know is in Dr Seuss” in 2015, saying in reference to once of his stories: “We’re all the same, so why would we treat somebody differently just because they don’t have a star on their belly?”The general public appear to have retained this positive view of the author despite his “cancellation”, with his books occupying 42 of 50 places on the “movers and shakers” list on Amazon.com as of March 3rd — ironically something of a boost for Dr Seuss Enterprises.Breitbart London has asked the British government to clarify whether the Prime Minister’s choice of a Dr Seuss story for his World Book Day was intended to convey a message with respect to the ongoing controversy.Dr. Seuss is now racist. https://t.co/hO7CKOrMEU— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 2, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeBarack ObamaBritainCancel CultureCommunity CohesionCulture Warculture warsdiversityDr. SeussJoe BidenKamala HarrisMichelle ObamaMulticulturalismpolitical correctnessSJWsSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorsUnited KingdomWokewokenessWokismWorld Book Day.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
657,"Germany’s federal domestic intelligence service has allegedly declared the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party a suspected extremist group, allowing the agency to actively spy on the government’s opposition.The revelations came on Wednesday via alleged sources within the German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) who spoke to German media, rather than through an official announcement from the agency.The sources claim that the BfV has declared the AfD, the official opposition in the German federal parliament, a “suspected case” of far-right extremism and a threat to the democratic order of the country, allowing the agency to secretly deploy undercover moles known as “V-Men” and wiretap the entire party and its members, Die Welt reports.The anti-mass migration populist party has taken the matter to court and the legal case is still ongoing, something the BfV referred to, telling German media: “In view of the ongoing proceedings and out of respect for the court, the BfV does not comment publicly on this matter.”Just Eight Months From Elections, German Populists Face Being Spied on By State Intelligence Agency https://t.co/DAekQsMSXI— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2021Alice Weidel, the AfD group leader in the federal parliament, commented on the report, saying: “The Office for the Protection of the Constitution is purely political on the issue of the AfD.”“This is particularly remarkable given the upcoming state and federal elections this year,” Weidel said, adding: “I am sure that such a classification of the AfD will not stand before the Federal Constitutional Court.”Jörg Meuthen and Tino Chrupalla, the party leaders, said the AfD would take legal action. They also said the BfV had given them no official confirmation.The BfV had previously promised not to spy on the party or make any official announcements on the party’s status while a court case in the Administrative Court of Cologne was still ongoing.AfD deputy leader Markus Frohnmaier went even further than his party colleagues, demanding that if the reports from the sources were true, BfV head Thomas Haldenwang should immediately resign.“The Office for the Protection of the Constitution has promised the courts to remain silent pending a decision in the ongoing proceedings.

659,"MOSCOW (AP) – The European Medicines Agency said it has started a rolling review of Sputnik V, many months after the vaccine was first approved for use in Russia and after dozens of countries around the world have authorized it.In a statement Thursday, the European regulator said the review is based on results from lab studies and research in adults, which suggests the vaccine may help protect against coronavirus.Despite scepticism about Russia’s hasty introduction of the vaccine, which was rolled out before it had completed late-stage trials, the vaccine appears to be safe and effective. According to a study published in the journal Lancet, Sputnik V was about 91 per cent effective in preventing people from becoming severely ill with COVID-19.The EMA has not set a date for when its expert group might meet to assess Sputnik V data to decide if it should be approved across the European Union, but the rolling review process is meant to expedite the authorization process, which can typically take several months.HealthLondon / EuropePoliticsBrusselscoronavirusCOVID-19EUEuropean UnionpandemicRussiaSputnik VvaccinationVaccinevaccinesWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
660,"The French government has announced the official dissolution of the anti-mass migration activist group Generation Identitaire (Generation Identity), after Interior Minister Gerald Darmamin claimed they incite violence.The dissolution decree states that the identitarian group, which became famous following the 2015 migrant crisis for their Greenpeace-esque protests and actions, “should be seen as inciting hate speech discrimination or violence against individuals because of their origin, race and religion.”Darmanin added in the decree that Generation Identitaire “could be seen as having the character of a private militia” and accused the group of having a “military form and organisation” 20 Minutes reports.The decree also notes that the group had received a donation from Christchurch mosque terrorist Brenton Tarrant, who gave the group 2,200 euros in the autumn of 2017, well over a year before his March 2019 attack that claimed the lives of 51 people.French ‘Crimes Against Humanity, Genocide, War Crimes’ Body to Investigate Anti-Migration Protest https://t.co/LFJvRTTP6i— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021Other far-right groups are mentioned, but not specifically named, as having links to Generation Identitaire in the decree, which states it has “links with ultra-right groups… who defend an ideology calling for discrimination, violence or hatred in the name of racialist or supremacist theories.”The group’s dissolution came despite protests from the group last month in Paris, where a demonstration was held by a group of between 1,500 and 2,000 members and supporters.The government decree comes just weeks after it was revealed that France’s Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity, Genocide, and War Crimes (OCLCH) was investigating group members over a protest against illegal migration in the French Pyrenees that took place in January.The French government has also previously taken members of the group to court over border demonstrations.

661,"A parent has described to a major British newspaper the prospect of a “mask apartheid” when schools reopen next week, after some educators have determined that while they cannot legally force children to wear masks, they will be segregated from their peers.The Conservative Party government has recommended that secondary school pupils (aged 11 to 18) wear masks in areas of schools where they are not able to socially distance, such as in classrooms and other confined spaces where children cannot keep two metres (six feet) apart.However, despite face coverings for pupils not being mandatory, parents have told The Telegraph that they have been notified if their children do not wear them, they will be forced to sit at the back of the class and even be segregated from their friends at lunch.One school, The Stonehenge School in Amesbury, Wiltshire, also appeared to emotionally blackmail parents and children by saying that “their peers may not wish to sit with or work with them” if pupils aren’t wearing masks. Non-compliant children at The Stonehenge School would also be “asked to sit near open doors or windows”.Sources speaking to the newspaper outlined that other punishments include children being forced to go through a separate entrance and being barred from group class activities such as PE and drama and after-school clubs.The Department for Education has said that children must not be “denied education” if they refuse to wear masks; however, some schools have allegedly threatened to send pupils home to get a mask or even expel mask refusers, on the grounds that uncovered children “risk” the safety of staff members.“The most worrying thing I find about the whole last year is the enthusiasm with which people have embraced the diminution of their civil liberties and their ordinary lives.""  https://t.co/cI6hPvc7er— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2021One parent told The Telegraph that the plans represented a “mask apartheid”, explaining: “If you start treating children differently, it will impact on their ability to learn. The Government needs to be very clear that no pupils should be discriminated against in this way.”Allyson Pollock, Clinical Professor of Public Health at Newcastle University, said there is “no evidence” that wearing masks in class stops transmission and criticised the “coercion” of children. She also warned of the “other harms are emerging as a result – psychological trauma, isolation, segregation stigmatising children”, condemning schools for institutionalising “a form of abuse and harassment and intimidation of children and parents”.Baronness Fox of Buckley, who has condemned the government for recommending masks in classrooms, said of the report that the proposed measures were  “creating totally unnecessary and divisive stress for all. No attempt to even justify them via evidence/efficacy — just a defensive emphasis [the guidance] will be reviewed at Easter. In the meantime, classrooms are not safer, but more alienating.”The report follows another by the same publication which revealed claims that schools are “blackmailing” parents into consenting to have their children tested for coronavirus in the next few weeks, allegedly being told they would be banned from the classroom otherwise.The Telegraph obtained a copy of the letter sent to parents of children at Hornchurch High School in Havering, in which headteacher Val Mason wrote: “If you do not provide consent your child will not be permitted to return to face-to-face lessons. They will instead be required to complete their work remotely whilst being accommodated on the school site in a separate space.”A parent told the newspaper: “This is coercion bordering on blackmail.

The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
663,"Hundreds of thousands of native British nursing candidates have been rejected over the past decade, while the government made it easier to bring in cheaper nurses from abroad, a report from Migration Watch UK has claimed.The report, which was seen by Breitbart London, said that even during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic last year, over 23,000 British applications for nursing courses were rejected, despite the government offering 1,200 fast-tracked Health and Care Worker visas to foreigners during the same time.Since 2010, over half of the nearly 650,000 UK-based nursing course applications were rejected, with 348,000 applicants in Britain being turned away, Migration Watch UK reported.In recent years, the British government has sought to recruit tens of thousands of foreign nurses under the premise of a “shortage” of NHS staff. In 2016, for example, nurses were placed on the shortage occupation list — making it easier to hire from abroad — despite 36,200 Britain-based applications being rejected during the same year.At the time, Migration Advisory Committee chairman Sir David Metcalfe said: “There is no good reason why the supply of nurses cannot be sourced domestically.”In 2018, the study found 21,000 nursing applications were rejected, even as over 5,100 visas were granted to foreign nurses that year.Since 2012/13, the percentage of non-British nationals joining the NHS has jumped from 16 per cent to 29 per cent.The think tank suggested that the NHS’s desire to hire foreign healthcare workers could be to save costs, as migrant nurses on work permits earn around a fifth less than British nurses.Commenting on the findings, Migration Watch chairman Alp Mehmet said: “It is utterly unacceptable that so many UK-based nursing candidates have been rejected while the NHS has been encouraged from the top to recruit many thousands of nurses from overseas, partly to save costs.“Ministers’ fine words about investing in young British talent are looking ever-more hollow.”‘Give British Workers a Chance!’ Think Tank Bashes Plan to Import Millions of Workers During Economic Crisis https://t.co/mlrb6mZRR9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 1, 2020The think tank said that the government added “insult to injury” by recently announcing the expansion of poor countries from which the NHS can “actively recruit” healthcare workers during a time of high unemployment in the United Kingdom.The expansion saw the addition of over 100 ‘green-lighted’ countries, including both Zimbabwe and South Africa — two countries that are currently experiencing severe shortages of healthcare workers.“The move is immoral because it risks taking much-needed health staff from countries that have much greater needs than the UK even as this country fails to train up enough of its own domestic nurses,” Migration Watch said.The concern in Britain about poaching healthcare workers from the countries that trained them has been longstanding.In 2015, the then-chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, Dr Peter Carter, said: “We cut our training programmes to save money, but we are going off to India, Africa, and the Philippines to recruit nurses they have trained and can ill afford to lose. I don’t feel good about going to a developing country and nicking their nurses.”That year some 37,000 UK-based nursing applications were rejected. Dr Carter said that while some of the rejections “would have been appropriate… I can’t believe the majority of them wouldn’t have been fit.”African Docs: NHS Importing Migrant Medics Hurts Poor Countries https://t.co/dUu4tYoHoJ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 23, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthImmigrationLondon / EuropeAlp MehmetForeign Labourforeign work visasforeign workershealthcaremass immigrationMass Migrationmigrant workersmigrationMigration Watch UKNational Health ServiceNHSNursesSocialised MedicineUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
664,"BRUSSELS (AP) – An inquiry into claims that the European Union’s border and coast guard agency was involved in illegally pushing back migrants has found no link to Frontex in any of the incidents but has been unable to establish what happened in five cases, according to the official report into the allegations.The report is by a special working group set up to investigate media allegations that staff, ships or aircraft working with Frontex took part in or were near more than a dozen pushback incidents at the border between Greece and Turkey last year, mostly in the Aegean Sea. The agency’s management board will discuss it at an extraordinary meeting on Friday.Frontex, which is responsible for patrolling the external borders of the 27-nation EU, has rejected the pushback allegations and said that its own internal inquiry could find no evidence to substantiate the claims. Greece, which is in charge of operations involving Frontex on its territory, has also denied reports of pushbacks by its border officers.Pushbacks are forcibly preventing people from entering a country when they might want to apply for asylum. They are contrary to refugee protection agreements, which say people shouldn’t be returned to a country where their life and safety might be in danger due to their race, religion, nationality or political views. They also contravene EU law and policy.The working group cleared Frontex of any wrongdoing in 8 cases, but said in five cases “it has not been possible to completely resolve the incidents beyond any reasonable doubt,” according to part of the restricted report, dated March 1 and seen by The Associated Press.Investigators could not determine whether the people involved in the five incidents were picked up by Turkish authorities or made it safely onto Greek soil. “There is no indication of anybody injured, reported missing or having died in connection with the respective incidents,” the report said.FLASHBACK: ‘We Are Against Building Walls’ – EU Refused to Fund ‘Pointless’ Greek Border Fence Before Crises https://t.co/DvRQmDrg0V— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 16, 2020Frontex Executive Director Fabrice Leggeri told EU lawmakers Thursday that “I don’t see any substantiated violation of fundamental rights that would be in this report.” He didn’t elaborate on what else was in the document.The probe, by experts from seven European countries and the European Commission, was set up weeks after reports of collective migrant expulsions were revealed in an October joint investigation by media outlets Bellingcat, Lighthouse Reports, Der Spiegel, ARD and TV Asahi.The reports raised troubling questions about the actions of Frontex, whose mandate and budget has been massively boosted since the entry of well over a million people in 2015, most fleeing conflict in Syria, sparked one of the EU’s biggest-ever political disputes over how to manage the influx.Some of the alleged incidents happened in chaotic times in the Aegean around March and April 2020, when Turkey, angered by the EU’s reluctance to support its invasion of northern Syria, allowed thousands of migrants to set out for the Greek border and islands unchecked. The coronavirus was also surging at the time.In one of the alleged “maritime pushback” cases on April 28-29, a group of refugees and migrants was said to have been returned to an unseaworthy life raft without a motor or paddles and towed toward Turkey from near the island of Samos, as a surveillance plane watched from the sky.But the working group could find no evidence that Frontex was involved or had been notified about it. None of the routings of the agency’s aircraft match the report, nor were any of its ships or vehicles in the area referred to in media reports.More broadly, the investigators insist that “serious incident reports” must be quickly drafted after any suspicious incident and fundamental rights officers immediately informed. Frontex was due to have hired 40 fundamental rights officers by this year, but none are in place. Leggeri said Thursday that the first contracts could be offered next month.The investigators recommend that the actions of Frontex planes or ships be recorded on video, and that they remain after any incidents to observe the actions of national police and border agents.EU Migration Commissioner Ylva Johansson welcomed the report, and noted that a “new culture” of sensitivity toward possible misconduct is needed at Frontex, and she criticized the agency for being too slow to respond to the allegations.“This has taken too long,” Johansson told the lawmakers, who are separately investigating the pushback claims. “This time has not been good for the reputation and the trust for the agency.” She rejected accusations that the European Commission itself has been too slow to provide Frontex with legal advice on how to handle boats carrying migrants in the Aegean.Orban: EU’s Permissive Stance on Migration Has ‘Turned the Mediterranean Into a Cemetery’ https://t.co/vkCuEfZNee— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 25, 2021ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsasylum seekersborder controlborder controlsEUEurope Migrant CrisisEuropean UnionFabrice LeggeriFrontexIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationMass MigrationMigrant CrisisMigrantsrefugeesYlva Johansson.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
665,"More than half of Britons have said that they would miss lockdown — despite the country experiencing multiple shutdowns and other restrictions for almost a year, coming at a cost of their civil liberties.In a YouGov daily question poll on Tuesday, a combined 55 per cent of respondents said they would miss lockdown, including 46 per cent who said they would “miss some aspects of lockdown” and almost one-in-ten (nine per cent) claiming they would miss “many” aspects of the strict measures.Just barely over one-third — 39 per cent — of the 3,057 British adults surveyed said they would “not miss any aspects of lockdown” at all.The findings follow other polls that point to Britons supporting — with large pluralities and at times in the majority — the government shutdown, including another recent poll that showed eight in ten (82 per cent of) British adults backing secondary school children (aged 11 to 18) being forced to wear masks at school if they could not socially distance. Others in the past year have shown Britons supporting mandatory coronavirus vaccines in employment contracts, harsher punishments for rule breakers, and mobile phone tracking of people subject to quarantine.Earlier this week, the lockdown sceptic MP Sir Desmond Swayne admitted that he found it “unnerving” the “enthusiasm with which people have embraced the diminution of their civil liberties and their ordinary lives”, hoping that as they see the impact of lockdown on health, society, and education play out, then public opinion might change.“Although, to be fair, we’re told these things by pollsters, but I find it quite difficult finding many of these people who have these views,” the Conservative MP for New Forest West said.UK Govt Scientist Says Britons Should Wear Masks with THREE Layers https://t.co/AijieIj6aX— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021Other lockdown critics have questioned whether the mood painted by pollsters of Britons as passively supporting lockdown was not entirely a reflection of their real-world experiences, with Martin Daubney, journalist and former Brexit Party MEP, remarking of the poll showing overwhelming support for covering children’s faces as “bear[ing] no resemblance to reality”.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced on Wednesday an extension of the government’s furlough package until September 2021 — despite the prime minister last week revealing the lifting of all social restrictions by June 21st.Reclaim party leader and actor Laurence Fox remarked on the scheme, saying: “Furlough until September is like convincing someone to rob their own home. It’s a strategy devoid of hope. It’s bribery, not leadership.”While political commentator and journalist Isabel Oakeshott said: “What’s the point of extending furlough till autumn when we could just open up the economy? We have a world leading vaccination programme. Soon all vulnerable groups will all have had jabs. Why continue to pay people to sit around making banana bread?”In contrast, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced on Tuesday the end of the mask mandate in the U.S. state, and that any business is free to open.“It is time for Texas to be open 100 per cent,” Governor Abbott said. “Everybody that wants a job should be able to get a job.

666,"The majority of Germans have said that the European Union has mishandled the rollout of vaccines — a shock result for citizens from the historically pro-EU country.Polling data released on Wednesday from global communications firm Kekst CNC found that Germans were the most critical of the EU’s performance in procuring vaccines, with 51 per cent saying Brussels had handled the rollout “badly” and just 17 per cent saying the bloc had done “well”.France had a plurality (35 per cent) of respondents say Brussels had done badly, with Kekst CNC remarking across all EU member states polled: “The European Union has seen its ratings fall across these three markets — down seven points in Sweden, down eight points in France, and down fully 24 points in Germany.”Internally, the majority of Germans (53 per cent) thought that their country’s vaccine rollout was too slow, along with France (60 per cent), and Sweden (65 per cent). Amongst European countries, only Britons in the majority thought that the speed of the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in their country was “about right” at a massive 76 per cent.According to Our World in Data, the United Kingdom has given at least one injection to 31 per cent of the population compared to less than 10 per cent in Germany.Most Germans (46 per cent) also thought their country had handled the vaccine rollout “badly”, coming second only to Swedes who had even less confidence (51 per cent) in their country.A seasoned German journalist has said that his home country is currently experiencing “unfamiliar feelings of post-Brexit envy” as “Brexit Britain races ahead” in its vaccine programme. https://t.co/rdLp5V1qt1— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 3, 2021Meanwhile, another poll carried out by the DPA news agency and reported by German broadcaster Deutsche Welle found that most Germans (43 per cent) want a relaxation of Covid restrictions, with 17 per cent calling for a complete end to lockdown.The Kekst CNC findings are largely in line with the flourishing of open criticism of both Germany’s government and the EU in German media. Earlier this week, the United Kingdom correspondent for German daily Die Welt wrote that his fellow countrymen were experiencing “unfamiliar feelings of post-Brexit envy” as “Brexit Britain races ahead” to vaccinate its population. He added that “nobody waxes enthusiastic about the EU any more, and the notion of ever-closer union has evaporated.”The European Commission, headed by Germany’s former defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, came under criticism after her demand to take control of procuring vaccines for the entire bloc resulted in massive delays in vaccine production, while Brexit Britain speeded ahead.Despite von der Leyen initially trying to blame the drugs company AstraZeneca — at one point her office threatened to block the exports of vaccines made under British contract from leaving the EU and even demanded doses made in Britain be sent to Europe to make up for the shortfall — European media has not been shy about laying the blame at von der Leyen and the bloc’s bloated bureaucracy.Peter Tiede from Bild, Europe’s most widely-read publication, had written that the EU had created “the biggest confidence-destroying programme in its history”.“On top of this, Brussels and the governments of the EU states have managed to confirm the old prejudice of a sluggish Europe. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, denies all blame. Whistling loudly in the dark and thus damaging even further any confidence in her ability to run the EU,” the chief political reporter for the German magazine continued.Germany’s Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz has reportedly criticised European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s vaccine programme, calling it “really shit”. https://t.co/K6krcnYBzF— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 6, 2021HealthLondon / EuropePoliticsAngela MerkelBrexitcoronavirusEUEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionGermanylockdownpandemicpollUrsula von der LeyenvaccinationVaccinevaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
667,"A sobbing paramedic who had just escorted a dying 18-year-old to hospital confronted a fireman to demand to know why his colleagues had just “stood around” rather than helping save lives at the Manchester bombing. Fire services had arrived at the scene almost two hours after the Islamist suicide attack because police had failed to inform them and the ambulance service of the incident.The remarks were reported during the most recent sitting of the inquiry into the terror attack on the Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on May 22nd, 2017, committed by Islamist son of Libyan refugees Salman Abedi.The attack had resulted in the deaths of 22 people and the injury of some 800 others, the assault being marked by its brutality as the jihadist intentionally targetted an event full of women, children, and families.The inquiry had heard last week that on the night of the bombing, Manchester police had mistakenly declared Operation Plato, the codename for a terror attack involving a marauding gunman, and had also failed to notify the ambulance and fire services of the incident in order to arrange a coordinated response.Retired duty command support officer Alan Topping told the inquiry panel on Tuesday that he was not aware of the 10:31 p.m. blast until around an hour later, and that upon arriving at Thompson Street fire station at 12:25 a.m., after dealing with a mill fire, he was shocked to find several fire trucks on the forecourt, “with a lot of firefighters hanging around, some lying down”, according to comments reported by the Daily Mail.Mr Topping told the inquiry that while Manchester fire services had specialist teams to deal with serious injury victims, they would have had to have been there “within five to 10 minutes” to have had a meaningful impact on saving lives, but that by the time they had arrived some two hours later, they were “not really going to offer that much help”.Manchester Arena Operators Accused of Putting Profits Above Lives Before Ariana Grande Terror Attack https://t.co/SdquT7eFxK— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 27, 2021Manchester Central Fire Station was less than a mile away from the arena. However, watch manager Andrew Simister revealed on Tuesday that he and his teams were diverted to Philips Park Fire Station, a rendezvous point, and in the opposite direction to the blast. Mr Simister detailed that it was almost an hour until a Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) group manager arrived, who was greeted by enraged firefighters left standing around waiting for instruction. The firefighters were then sent back to Manchester Central, where joining a convoy with other trucks and a “sea of ambulances” they finally made it to the concert hall.The inquiry also heard the remarks of a fireman who had been confronted by a crying paramedic, demanding to know where they had been while people were dying.He said: “She came over crying, pleading with us to go over and help.“Her exact words were, ‘what are you doing just stood around here? There are people dying, we need your help. I have just taken an 18-year-old girl in the back of an ambulance who died en route to hospital and you lot are just stood around.'”Following the terror attack, Topping described how his colleagues were “in tears” for failing to attend the terror attack in time, and acknowledged that some turned their backs on their senior commander during the debrief.Mr Topping said: “I don’t think it was a conscious decision, I think it was just when you’re not being answered, people show emotions differently, people were turning away, they were walking away, people were crying — I have never seen firefighters crying in a debrief, never — that’s the level of emotions what was going on.“Firefighters felt such shame, disappointment, all the words which you could use, to describe why we didn’t attend that incident to help people.“I felt ashamed to be a firefighter and felt like we let the people of Greater Manchester down. We were there to help people and we didn’t do our job.”Manchester Bomber Used Government Benefits to Buy Bomb Parts https://t.co/pSvqJveCFo— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2020So far, the enquiry had revealed a series of failures from police, Arena security, and the intelligence services. Late last year, it was revealed that MI5 knew that Salman Abedi, who was well-known to the service, was interacting with known Islamic extremists in the weeks running up to the attack, including one serving time in prison.Six months before, Greater Manchester Police were made aware of the inefficiencies of their planned responses to terror attacks, but did not act on them. British Transport Police and Community Support Officers had also failed to ensure consistent and adequate coverage of the venue’s environs, meaning that Abedi was able to walk into the Arena carrying a large, suspicious backpack without being stopped or searched.Private security also brushed off the public’s concerns about Abedi, including after he was seen praying erratically in the foyer, with a security guard admitting that he did not question Abedi for his suspicious behaviour because he “was scared of being wrong and being branded a racist”.The inquiry continues.UK: 8-year-old Islamic Terror Bombing Victim Could Have Survived with Better Care https://t.co/LkVeKJ81wm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 18, 2021EntertainmentLaw and OrderLondon / Europe2017 Manchester terror attackAriana GrandeIslamist terrorIslamist terrorismManchester Arenamanchester attackManchester bombingSalman AbediUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
668,"The European Commission has reportedly authorised the Italian government to block a shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines destined for Australia, using for the first time an export control system the EU created if it deemed a drugs company had failed to deliver its orders to the European Union.Two sources speaking to Reuters said on Thursday that the EU’s powerful executive arm had agreed to Italy’s request to deny Swedish-British firm AstraZeneca to ship 250,000 doses of its coronavirus vaccine from its Anagni plant, near the Italian capital of Rome.If correct, the move would be the latest row between the drugs company and the European Union. In January, AstraZeneca told the EU that owing to production issues at its European plants, the first batch would be smaller than expected.The Commission blamed the drugs company and claimed it was favouring Brexit Britain over Europe, while its CEO Pascal Soriot said that British orders would be on time because London had signed an agreement three months ahead of Brussels.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had insisted on taking over vaccine procurement on behalf of the EU27, with reports that the bloc’s bloated bureaucracy led to a delay in signing the contract, which in turn had a knock-on effect on laboratories starting production.Farage: ‘Nasty, Vindictive’ EU Threats on Vaccines Shows UK Was Right to Vote Leave https://t.co/MbxRxsJ0v8— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 27, 2021As the British raced on ahead to vaccinate its citizens, the EU went into a vengeful panic, raiding a plant in Belgium it suspected of having sent EU doses to Britain, threatening to impound vaccines made in Europe under British contract, and even demanding that vaccines made in Britain under order by Johnson’s government be handed over to Europe.The EU made good on one of its threats, authorising the banning of vaccines to non-EU countries if it was deemed a drugs company had not fulfilled European contracts, as was the case on Thursday.Sky News reports claims that the vaccines, rather than going to their intended destination Australia, will be redistributed within the EU. While the United Kingdom has managed to vaccinate nearly one-third (30 per cent) of its population, the EU has managed only around eight per cent on average.While Commission President von der Leyen had sought to blame everyone else apart from herself for Europe’s vaccine debacle, Europe’s media were not reticent about attributing the blame squarely to the EU, with one German editor labelling it the “biggest confidence-destroying programme” in the bloc’s history.A recent poll revealed that a majority of people in Germany — historically, strong supporters of the European Project — thought the EU had handled the vaccine rollout badly.Farage: “If this crisis has taught us anything, it is that the best decisions are taken by national governments acting in their national interest.

669,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate.

670,"The UK government’s total fiscal support for businesses and individuals impacted by the state-mandated coronavirus shutdowns will rise to £407 billion, the Chancellor has said, and years of tax rises are on their way to pay for it.Britain’s Chancellor Rishi Sunak has presented a mixed picture of the health of the country after nearly a full year of on-off lockdown, offering continued government handouts and tax cuts for some, but also withdrawing future tax falls in some areas, and ordering outright tax rises in others.Headline announcements include the extension of the various coronavirus support schemes, including cash support to businesses and furlough payments to laid-off workers until September in some cases, well beyond the projected end of lockdown. This is to cushion the shock of reopening the economy, the Chancellor said.This and other support to businesses will see the government’s debt rise to record levels. The Chancellor will have spent £407 billion over two years on coronavirus support, he said, paid for with £355 billion in new borrowing. This will be the highest level since the Second World War.Decade of Conservative Rule Saw Tax Raised on Britons Over 1,000 Times https://t.co/BBLsSwvNjJ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 28, 2021This extraordinary spending will now have to be paid for, Sunak said, and projected borrowing would continue to rise until 2023, when it would start to fall or else total borrowing would rise to unsustainable levels. Underlining the scale of the problem the government created by electing to shut down the economy last year, Sunak said: “It is going to be the work of many governments over many decades to [pay the money borrowed] back”, and just a one per cent increase in interest rates and inflation now would increase the cost of the government’s debts by £25 billion at a stroke.Balancing his continued big spending on coronavirus bailouts with his intention to get the blossoming national debt under control, Mr Sunak told Parliament: “While it is right to help businesses and people through an acute crisis like this one, in normal times the state should not be borrowing to pay for everyday public spending… in the medium term we can not allow our debt to keep rising, and given how high our debt is now, we should be paying attention to its affordability.”A key victim of the government’s lockdown is one of the Conservative Party’s core vote-winners: its reliability at cutting income taxes for ordinary Britons faster than the value of those wages are eroded away through inflation. The so-called ‘personal allowance’ — a tax-free amount anyone may earn before the state begins to deprive them through income tax — had risen from £6,475 in 2010 to £12,500 by 2020.Yet this campaigning favourite will now be suspended, the annual increases enjoyed by working people over the past decade frozen for the rest of the parliament. While this isn’t a tax rise in the sense the thresholds at which different taxation levels kick-in will be preserved, as wage inflation pushes earnings higher, more and more people will be pushed into higher bands.Businesses will see tax rises more directly, with taxes on profits — known as corporation taxes — rising six per cent to 25 per cent. Sunak defended the change by noting Britain would still have the lowest levels of corporate profit taxes in the G7, but nevertheless, the UK will still lose its competitive advantage over 20 other OECD members with the great leap.Some of this will be offset, the Chancellor said, with a so-called “super deduction” incentive to encourage businesses to invest.

671,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — Hospital officials say three people wounded in an assault by a man using an axe in southern Sweden are in life-threatening condition and police have reduced the overall number of victims to seven.The suspected assailant, a man in his twenties, was shot, arrested and is being treated in a hospital, police said. A press conference was expected later Thursday on the attack.The other victims of Wednesday’s assault in the small town of Vetlanda, 190 kilometres (118 miles) south-east of Gothenburg (Göteborg), Sweden’s second-largest city, include two seriously injured people, two with moderate injuries, and one who is slightly injured, the Jonkoping region said in a statement late Wednesday.The attack took place in the afternoon and police say there are five crime scenes in Vetlanda, a town of 13,000. The man’s motive was not immediately known.Police said the man, who they would not identify in line with Swedish policy, is known to them for petty crimes.

673,"A group of an estimated 100 far-left anarchist extremists formed a checkpoint on the streets of an Athens suburb this week, allegedly checking cars to see if police officers were inside.The anarchists stopped cars in the Athens suburb of Zografou and demanded to see the identification documents of drivers and passengers.According to a report from the newspaper Proto Thema, the far-leftists were from a nearby student dormitory located on Olof Palme street, named after the murdered former prime minister of Sweden.Theodoros Chronopoulos, a spokesman for the Greek police, confirmed the incident, saying that members of the public had complained about being stopped and checked.The checkpoint comes after anarchist extremists clashed with police during a demonstration in Athens to support convicted terrorist Dimitris Koufodinas, who is currently on hunger strike. The far-leftist, who served as the top hitman for the notorious Revolutionary Organization 17 November, is serving 11 life sentences for murders from 1975 to 2000.Since Koufodinas began his hunger strike in January, demanding to be transferred out of a maximum-security prison, there have been several violent incidents supporting the convicted terrorist, including the firebombing of an office of the ruling New Democracy party in an Athens suburb.Last week, dozens of Koufodinas’s supporters were arrested after attempting to occupy the offices of the Greek culture ministry in Athens, with protesters also being subject to 300 euro fines for breaking the country’s Wuhan coronavirus restrictions.A total of 42 far-left militants were arrested after storming the Greek cultural ministry in support of far-left convicted terrorist Dimitris Koufontinas in the latest acts against Greek officials. https://t.co/xvZ869Y7gu— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 1, 2021In February, around 5,000 students in Greece’s second-largest city Thessaloniki gathered outside the city courthouse to protest a new law that would allow police to patrol university grounds and make arrests.While police access to campuses has been restricted for decades, the Greek conservative government argued that the lack of police presence had allowed for violent protests and other criminal behaviour to take place on university grounds.Law and OrderLondon / Europeanarchistsanti-policeAthensfar-left extremismfar-left ideologyGreece.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
674,"Fidesz, the party of Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, has left the European People’s Party (EPP) in the European Parliament after the group voted to allow members to strip the privileges of other members.Prime Minister Orbán wrote a letter to the chairman of the EPP, Manfred Weber of the Angela Merkel aligned CSU party, announcing that Fidesz MEPs would leave the group, accusing the EPP of “trying to mute and disable our democratically elected MEPs” as many were concerned with the Wuhan virus pandemic.Hungarian Family Minister Katalin Novák shared the letter on social media, the message stating that the EPP amendments to the group’s rules are “anti-democratic, unjust, and unacceptable”.“Our MEPs will continue to speak for whom they represent, our voters, and defend the best interest of the Hungarian people, ” Prime Minister Orbán wrote.Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga commented on the move, blaming Weber, who she accused of weakening the group.

We have known for some time that Manfred Weber does not want to lead the group of the European People’s Party along with Christian-Conservative values,” she added.The move to leave the EPP, the largest association in the European Parliament and home of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), comes after years of conflict between so-called “centre-right” members of the group and Fidesz over several issues.In March of 2019, EPP members voted to suspend Fidesz after complaining of anti-EU rhetoric from the party during the European Parliament elections.Members such as the Swedish Moderates and the Swedish Christian Democrats were particularly vocal about suspending the Hungarian conservatives, with Moderate politician Tomas Tobé alleging that the Orbán government was dismantling the rule of law domestically.“I am very critical of the development in Hungary and do not believe that Fidesz should remain in the [EPP] group; it is time for them to leave now,” Tobé said at the time.Exclusive: Brexit Should be a Wake Up Call For Brussels, Says Hungarian MEP https://t.co/semMqj8tnz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 10, 2019In April of 2020, 13 parties in the EPP called for the president of the group, Donald Tusk, to expel Fidesz after claiming the government’s emergency law to combat the spread of the Wuhan virus could be extended “indefinitely”.“The fight against COVID-19 requires extensive measures, however, the virus cannot be used as a pretext to extend the state of emergency indefinitely. We fear that Prime Minister Orbán will use his newly achieved power to further extend the government’s grip on civil society,” the parties said.The European Commission later admitted the Hungarian emergency law did not violate any European Union rules.

675,"The city council of Bristol has approved a motion calling for reparations for slavery as an act of “atonement” for the British port city’s role in the slave trade.The Labour Party-run council passed the motion by a margin of 47 votes to 12 on Tuesday following a zoom meeting of the councillors. The council agreed to implement “community wealth creation strategies” and to write to the British Parliament demanding the establishment of a commission to determine “how reparations may be delivered”.In a peculiar act of so-called cultural appropriation, Cleo Lake — the Green Party councillor who led the motion — called upon the other members to support reparations by “representing” as US civil rights leader Rosa Parks in a mock American accent.“I believe we are here on this Earth to live, grow, and to do what we can to make the world a better place for all people to enjoy,” she said in a put-on accent while quoting Ms Parks.In a statement, the Bristol city council said that racial injustice today is a byproduct of “economic injustice or domination of the global economy established in the seventeenth century,” and therefore “efforts need to be made to expedite the atonement process, and work needs to be done to achieve holistic reparations.”The left-wing council went on to say that “reparative justice should be driven by Afrikan Heritage Communities experiences, voices and perspectives to ensure that advocacy messages not only reflect but also respond to the real needs of the community in order to recognise inequalities.”WATCH: ‘Reparationist’ Calls for Creation of ‘Pan-African Superstate’ at Extinction Rebellion Rally https://t.co/BOvvlPTgl6— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 5, 2020In response to the reparations push, Robert Poll of the Save Our Statues campaign told Breitbart London: “This is straight from the Critical Race Theory playbook, perpetuating a simplistic and divisive victim/aggressor narrative. It’s a misrepresentation both of history and of the people of Bristol. Nobody today is guilty. Nobody today is a victim.”A senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think tank, Calvin Robinson, added that Bristol has become “the first city in the UK to go entirely woke.”“There’s a clear misunderstanding amongst Bristol politicians. People are struggling because of a whole host of socio-economic issues; an attempt to put the blame on race is narrow-minded and short-sighted. They’d do far better to look at the class disparity in the city,” Robinson told Breitbart London.“The idea of reparations in the 21st century to somehow make-up for atrocities of the 16th/17th century is beyond ridiculous. Whose money are they suggesting we use to pay reparations, and who are they suggesting reparations are paid to?” he questioned.Mr Robinson who has himself been the target of left-wing racism and even called a “race traitor” for being a black man espousing conservative views, noted that “there is no such thing as government money” and reparations would, in fact, be paid by the British taxpayer.“The idea that I am somehow owed monetary compensation for something my ancestors may or may not have experienced is lunacy. Would all brown people by eligible? The way our tax system works, that would mean relatively poor black people would be paying reparations to rich black people, it’s nonsensical,” he proclaimed.Mr Robinson said that the reparations push from the Bristol council is just another attempt at “virtue signalling from the woke elites,” adding: “The British Government apologised for its hand in the slave trade, it is our job as a Christian nation to accept that apology and move on. Let’s look forward, not backwards.”Black Lives Matter Figure Replaces Toppled Colston Statue in Bristol https://t.co/SZjHfdekg6— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 16, 2020Bristol was one of the United Kingdom’s top slave port cities during the 1700s. The city has in recent decades become a hotbed of left-wing activism, with Black Lives Matter vandals toppling the statue of British philanthropist and parliamentarian Sir Edward Colston last June for his role in the slave trade.While Great Britain did play a role in the slave trade, it became the first country in the world to abolish slavery.Following the passage of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the Royal Navy embarked on a campaign to end the practice, capturing an estimated 1,600 slave trade ships, and freeing some 150,000 African slaves in the process.Between 1830 and 1865 some 1,587 British sailors lost their lives in their fight against slavery.Calvin Robinson questioned whether the Bristol city council would recognise Britain’s efforts to stamp out the slave trade, proposing a statue in honour of William Grenville, who introduced the Slave Trade Act of 1807.WATCH: XR and BLM Activists Demand Reparations During ‘Walk of Shame’ Protest in the City of London https://t.co/APj5JOdNGf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 7, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeBlack Lives Matter UKBristolBritish HistoryCalvin RobinsonEdward ColstonLabour PartyreparationsSave Our StatuesSlave TradeSlaverySlavery ReparationsUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
676,"Since officially leaving the European Union at the beginning of the year, the number of illegal boat migrants arriving from the continent via the English Channel has continued its record-setting pace, with over 500 illegals being brought ashore in Britain this year.In February, 308 illegal aliens were recorded to have landed on British shores in 18 separate instances, adding to the 223 who were taken ashore in January.As the rough and wintery conditions subsided in recent days, the illegal crossings of the Channel have started to spike, with 87 migrants brought ashore on Saturday, alone.The latest landings mean that there have been 531 migrants officially recorded to have arrived this year, nearly double the number during the same time period last year (279), according to the Daily Mail.Last year, a record 8,410 illegal boat migrants were officially found to have entered the country, up from 1,850 the year before.The true number, however, is likely to have been higher, as the Home Office figures did not tally those believed to be under the age of eighteen in the count. The figures also, of course, do not account for those who arrived clandestinely.On Sunday, BBC reporter Simon Jones disclosed that “the Home Office has tonight refused to say how many migrants – if any – have been returned to EU countries since the start of the year. It says it will write to the Home Affairs Committee with that information.”In 2020, the number of foreign criminals deported by the Home Office fell by 79 per cent, with only 1,128 criminals successfully deported, down from 5,322 the year before.Aside from the failure to deport foreign criminals, the Home Office was revealed in December to have lost track of over 37,000 migrants, who either fled from detention centres of skipped bail over the past three decades.Take Back Control? 2020 Saw the Europe Migrant Crisis Land on British Shores https://t.co/q3AaPkMbFl— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 28, 2020To date, the UK has also failed to secure an agreement with the EU, or indeed any individual member state, on the issue of returning failed asylum seekers.The UK paid out an additional £28 million to France in November to fund extra security patrols along the coast, on top of the tens of millions already sent to the wealthy European Union nation since 2014.However, this has failed to meaningfully stop illegal immigration from pouring across the Channel from France.Despite promises to take back control of the country’s borders following Brexit, the nominally Conservative government has failed to do so and has so far refused to adopt a simple send back the boats approach — as seen to be effective in Australian in the past — rather than taking migrants ashore in the hopes that they will later be deported.The Home Office trotted out its standard refrain in regards to the latest migrant crossings, saying: “People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not risk their lives making these dangerous crossings. We are continuing to pursue the criminals behind these illegal crossings.”Farage: Britain is Paying France to Import COVID by Boat Migrants https://t.co/de4Ca5upI5— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 28, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaImmigrationLondon / Europeasylum seekersBoat MigrantsChannel CrisisChannel MigrantsdiversityEnglish ChannelEurope Migrant Crisishome officeIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationIllegal MigrantsMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant CrisisMulticulturalismpriti patelSocial CohesionUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
677,"Conservative MP Desmond Swayne has said he has found it “unnerving” how Britons have embraced their civil liberties being taken away during lockdowns, expressing hope that public opinion will shift once citizens realise the costs to health, education, and society.“The most worrying thing I find about the whole last year is the enthusiasm with which people have embraced the diminution of their civil liberties and their ordinary lives.“But the counter to that is the huge disruption we’ve had to education, the huge costs that we’re all going to have to pay, and the devastating consequences for mental health.“When all those things impinge on people’s lives, perhaps they will realise the damage that’s been done, and their enthusiasm will diminish,” Sir Desmond told talkRADIO’s Julia Hartley-Brewer on Tuesday.Survey after survey, notably those conducted by YouGov — a British polling firm co-founded in 2000 by Nadhim Zahawi, the current vaccine minister — pointed to Britons backing lockdown. Various reports from the group have shown the public demanding the police exact even harsher punishments on rule-breakers, supporting the idea of the government using phone data to surveil quarantined individuals, and in a plurality agreeing with mandatory ‘jabs for jobs’ employment contracts.Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne tells Julia he is optimistic the ""thirst for lockdown will diminish"" as the measures are eased, but remains concerned over ""the enthusiasm people have embraced the diminution of their civil liberties.""@JuliaHB1 | @DesmondSwayne pic.twitter.com/xL1HKJzRRj— talkRADIO (@talkRADIO) March 2, 2021Mr Swayne, however, claimed that despite the results of the numerous surveys, he has struggled to meet many people in real life who expressed true zeal for the government eroding civil liberties during the pandemic.“One of the things I have found most unnerving is that people have not protested at the way their civil liberties have been taken away, and appear to have given their assent and consent. Although, to be fair, we’re told these things by pollsters, but I find it quite difficult finding many of these people who have these views,” the MP for New Forest West said.Swayne is not alone in his doubts, with former Brexit Party MEP Martin Daubney saying last week that YouGov polling results “bear[] no resemblance to reality” after one found that a massive 82 per cent of Britons back children being forced to wear masks at schools if they were not able to socially distance, remarking: “This level of propaganda would make Putin blush.”Desmond Swayne also said he thought “the popularity of lockdown is based on the perception of the huge threat — in terms of death and in terms of the NHS being overwhelmed. I’m pretty confident that as hospital admissions tumble, and we get back to normality, that thirst for lockdown will diminish significantly.”Another remarkable characteristic that many polls point to is the state of fear Britons exist in over the Chinese coronavirus.'Emotionally Manipulative Propaganda': UK Govt Releases 'Stay Home' Coronavirus Scare Video https://t.co/gY4LmQjiP0— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 23, 2021A September 2020 poll by Orb International found that 83 per cent were frightened of a second wave of the virus “hitting the UK hard”, with 63 per cent backing tighter restrictions and a curfew. An anonymous MP told The Telegraph at the time that the government’s messages had made Britons “fearful”, allegedly to make people consent to “authoritarian” lockdown measures.Inducing fear might have been by government design. An official government briefing document from March 22nd, 2020, on “increasing adherence to social distancing measures” expressed concern that Britons did not feel enough personal fear over the pandemic.Under a heading entitled “persuasion”, the document said: “A substantial number of people still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened… The perceived level
of personal threat needs to be increased among those who are complacent, using hard-hitting emotional messaging.”Swayne’s marked concern over Britons’ apparent widespread acceptance of lockdown comes after author Peter Hitchens condemned fellow journalists and MPs for failing to fight hard enough against infringements on people’s rights.Speaking to talkRADIO on Monday, Mr Hitchens said that not enough people had backed the lockdown, and as such, the lockdown scepticism movement had “lost the contest”.“I don’t think there has been sufficient resistance at a time when it could have been of use. People wake up now and say, ‘oh gosh, this is all a terrible mistake’ — where were they?“Particularly in my own trade, but in general: where were they in the months of March, April, May, and June?“Where were they in parliament and the law when some difference could have been made, and this could have been stopped? They weren’t anywhere to be seen,” Mr Hitchens told host Mike Graham.Peter Hitchens says not enough people resisted lockdown when it counted, admitting the sceptic campaign has “lost the contest”.“I’m not going to pretend you can carry on fighting a battle with nobody behind you.”Watch in full ► https://t.co/QBqkYVeuHr@Iromg | @ClarkeMicah pic.twitter.com/QOH3fUjRuG— talkRADIO (@talkRADIO) March 1, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19Desmond SwaynelockdownMPspandemictalkRadioUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
678,"A convicted Nigerian criminal successfully evaded deportation from the UK after claiming that he is bisexual just hours before he was set to be kicked out of the country.The unnamed man was convicted of fraud in 2015 and was sentenced to five and a half years in prison after arriving in the country as a student in 2006.The Home Office began deportation proceedings against him in 2016, which were delayed by the migrant launching human rights claims in two judicial reviews.His initial asylum claims were shot down by a judge, however, The Sun reported on Sunday that in January of 2019 — just hours before his scheduled deportation — the migrant claimed that he was bisexual and could not live openly without repercussions in Nigeria.The criminal claimed that he had been subject to abuse at university and later in prison as a result of his sexuality. The Nigerian said that he was convinced to disclose his sexuality after discussions with a welfare officer and other detainees.The Home Office claimed that he was lying, as he had never mentioned his sexuality in the years of court appeals, yet an immigration judge granted the Nigerian criminal asylum.Commenting on the case, Conservative MP Nigel Mills said: “It’s the most ridiculous case I have ever heard.”“Every convicted criminal will be trying this now,” Mills warned.UK: ‘Activist Lawyers’ Block Deportation of Every Single Migrant on Planned Removal Flight https://t.co/QOt5PCzfHT— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 28, 2020Judges in the UK have often blocked the deportation of foreign criminals on the grounds that they may receive harsh treatment if returned to their homeland.In February, for example, a judge had blocked the deportation of a double rapist, who posed a “high risk of serious harm” to the public, because he would not be able to receive proper mental healthcare in his native Somalia.Last year, a judge in Scotland also quashed the removal of a Taliban fighter in June, after the terrorist claimed he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of fighting for the Islamist terrorist group and would not receive adequate mental health care in Afganistan.Despite sweeping to victory in the 2019 general election, securing an eighty seat majority, the Conservative government under Prime Minister Boris Johnson has so far failed to introduce any legislative fix to the broken asylum system.On Sunday, a spokesman for Priti Patel’s Home Office said: “Later this year the Government will legislate to fix the broken asylum system to make it firm and fair.”Patel has often espoused tough rhetoric on immigration, however, under her leadership, Home Office deportations fell by 79 per cent last year.Judges Block Deportation of Knife Killer Migrant on ‘Human Rights’ Grounds https://t.co/xVLlkMSk8y— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 23, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaCrimeImmigrationLondon / EuropeBritish deportationsBritish judgesBritish JudiciaryDeportationdeportationsdiversityEurope Migrant Crisisforeign criminalshome officeimmigrationimmigration judgesMulticulturalismNigerian migrantspriti patelUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
679,"Freedom of expression advocate Andrew Doyle has criticised the “regressive” left for branding any speech they don’t like as “hate speech”, also warning that in light of police forces being found to have recorded some 120,000 ‘non-crime hate incidents’, that as history teaches us, “once the police start making lists of people for non-criminal activity, we are in serious danger”.“Without freedom of speech, we don’t have any other liberties at all. I fear that people have lost sight of that,” the comedian behind the perennially offended Social Justice Warrior character Titania McGrath remarked on Monday.Doyle, a Shakespeare scholar who recently published Free Speech And Why It Matters, went on to acknowledge how the battle for free speech has been pitched between the right and the extremist left, despite the fundamental issue of free speech being one which “should be a non-partisan principle”.He went on to tell talkRADIO’s Julia Hartley-Brewer that all of the assaults on the basic right of free speech “is coming from the left, but a particular kind of left: an identity-obsessed social justice left” which will “claim to be on the side of the angels, and they use the language of progressivism to actually mask very regressive ideas.”“And what they’ll say, for instance, is, they’ll carve out exceptions within free speech, and they’ll call it ‘hate’,” he said, before citing the attacks by pro-trans ideology leftist radicals attempting to cancel Harry Potter and Cormoran Strike author JK Rowling — herself a left-winger and feminist — because she seeks to defend women’s legally protected spaces from biological men who claim to be women.“Of course, they’re not using these words accurately. So the people that they call ‘transphobe’, ‘Nazi’, ‘fascist’, ‘hateful’ — in particular — are often nothing of the kind… Nine times out of ten, those phrases are used in such a way that they simply don’t apply in that way.“It’s just a way to say, ‘Actually, we’ll call it “hate speech” because what it really is is speech that we hate.’’’‘Weaponised by Woke Activists’ — UK Police Recorded 120,000 ‘Non-Crime Hate Incidents’ https://t.co/iBVrDACJUm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 15, 2021Last month, figures revealed that between 2014 and 2019, English and Welsh police forces logged 120,000 so-called “non-crime hate incidents”. Police guidelines demand that non-crime hate incidents are recorded whether there is an identifiable victim or not, and “irrespective of whether there is any evidence to identify the hate element”. Hate incidents can also include instances of “unfriendliness, antagonism, resentment and dislike”.While not crimes, such incidents can result in a police record even if there is no conviction, with that non-crime hate incident potentially appearing on Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal background checks for up to six years.Mr Doyle called those figures “very, very frightening” and warned that if people knew their history, “they would know that once the police start making lists of people for non-criminal activity, we are in serious danger”.Last week, Merseyside Police made headlines for parading an electronic billboard reading “being offensive is an offence” during a “hate crime awareness event”. The force later apologised and admitted that “‘being offensive’ is not in itself an offence”.Despite the force walking back the campaign, Mr Doyle noted an issue that the incident revealed. Rather than it being the product of a “rogue officer with a Pharisee’s disposition”, it was clearly the result of careful design and planning, “which must have been approved in advance by numerous members of staff”.“Even if the slogan has now been retracted, the fact that it materialised at all suggests something very sinister about the general mindset of those who are trained to enforce the law,” Doyle wrote in Spiked Online, adding that: “Irrespective of the legality, it is now standard police practice to monitor the speech of citizens.”‘Being Offensive Is an Offence’ — UK Police Mocked for ‘Hate Crime Awareness’ Event https://t.co/l54qjZhuHx— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 22, 2021London / EuropeSocial JusticeAndrew DoyleCancel CultureCensorshipfree speechSocial Justice WarriorTitania McGrath.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
680,"Nearly one-quarter of frontline NHS staff in London have so far refused to take a vaccine for the Chinese coronavirus, figures from the National Health Service have revealed.Throughout the country, some 91 per cent of frontline healthcare workers have taken the coronavirus vaccine.However, in London, only 76 per cent have taken the jab, despite all staff members being offered one, the Sunday Times reported.Accross the city, over 41,000 frontline healthcare workers have not been vaccinated, while nationwide, over 200,000 frontline healthcare workers and care home staff members have not been inoculated against the Chinese virus.The joint chief nurse for the NHS in London, Martin Machray, said that NHS London will be translating videos about the coronavirus vaccine into commonly spoken languages in the capital besides English, in order to combat supposed misinformation spreading among specific groups.“Vaccinating staff is critical to the safe running of health and care settings, so we are working with trusts to ensure that all staff feel confident in taking the vaccine,” Mr Machray said.There have been growing concerns over the slow uptake of the coronavirus vaccines among so-called BAME (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic) communities within the UK, sparking fears that the country may see “pockets of infection” as it tries to lift lockdown restrictions.An analysis of over 19,000 healthcare workers at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust found that as of February 3rd, 64.5 per cent of staff had received a coronavirus vaccine. While the vaccine takeup from white staff members was at 71 per cent, it dropped to 59 per cent for those with South Asian heritage, and lower still at 37 per cent for black staff members.It was also revealed last month that at the Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust in London, only a quarter of black and Filipino staff had taken the vaccine, compared to 80 per cent of the staff as a whole.Sadiq Khan Demands Minorities Get Preferential Access to Coronavirus Vaccines https://t.co/uKn6Pp9YbN— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 19, 2020In January, the government’s top health quango, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), issued a report claiming that “structural and institutional racism and discrimination” played a central role in the hesitancy to take the vaccine among minority groups.The report found that vaccine hesitancy was most prevalent within the black community, at 72 per cent, followed by Pakistani/Bangladeshi at 42.3%.“Trust is also undermined by structural and institutional racism and discrimination. Minority ethnic groups have historically been underrepresented within health research, including vaccines trials, which can influence trust in a particular vaccine being perceived as appropriate and safe, and concerns that immunisation research is not ethnically heterogeneous,” the SAGE report stated.The director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, Dr Habib Naqvi, said that language barriers may be partly to blame, but noted that misinformation spread among certain groups is also a factor.“We need to be clear to our communities that there is no meat or meat products in the vaccine. There is no pork, there is no alcohol and it has been endorsed by religious leaders and religious councils,” Dr Naqvi said.On Sunday, an NHS spokesman said: “While it is for Government and Parliament to decide which groups of people are required to get the vaccine, the NHS national medical director and chief nurse agree with Chris Whitty, with the chair of the BMA and other professional leaders that NHS staff have a duty to be vaccinated unless they have a valid clinical reason not to do so.“Any member of NHS staff who has not yet taken up the offer should speak to their employer about getting vaccinated to protect themselves and others.”Report: National Health Service Will Use 'Sensible' Celebrities to Front Vaccines Campaign https://t.co/U1ED8lPW3i— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 30, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropeBAMEcoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid Vaccineethnic minoritiesLondonNational Health ServiceNHSUnited KingdomVaccinevaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
681,"At least ten former staff members are ready to come forward as claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex bullied and “humiliated” aides are probed.Allegations that Meghan, the former Suits starlet and wife of Prince Harry, inflicted “emotional cruelty and manipulation” on staff are being investigated by Buckingham Palace, after a former aide revealed she had been the subject of a bullying complaint and accused her of driving a number of people out of their jobs.“A group of people are queuing up to be involved. They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face. Our eyes met and she lowered hers, humiliation etched on her features.”Prince William Angered by Meghan and Harry's 'Insulting, Disrespectful, and Petulant' Attitude to Queen https://t.co/kvuRJbdJA9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021Before Meghan and Harry abandoned their duties as working royals — but not their titles — to pursue money-making ventures and activism in the United States, their communications secretary wrote to Prince William’s private secretary said he was “very concerned that the Duchess [of Sussex, Meghan] was able to bully two PAs out of the household in the past year. The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

They went for a walk at the nearest beach after her brother was hospitalised and in a coma. He asked them to stop harassing her. So cuffs on and off to Wrexham police station. #lockdown #COVID19 @northwaleslive pic.twitter.com/fnGUgD10tI— Neil McEvoy MS (@neiljmcevoy) March 1, 2021Radek Kotlarek moved to Wales from London with his family seven years ago for a peaceful life. But his treatment at the weekend by Welsh police, he says, was more redolent of Nazi German or the communist era in his native Poland.He told his story to Breitbart London:My family has been on edge for sometime under lockdown. We have suffered sickness and death among our relatives back in Poland and my children – we have two boys – have been especially affected. So on Sunday, we took our older son, who is 17, for a short walk on his favourite beach, about twenty miles from where we live.After our walk we had an ice cream and in the car park we saw two police officers handing out tickets for breaking Covid legislation. I did not feel we had committed a crime. A female officer explained the rules on taking exercise too far from your home. I tried to explain to her that this break was essential for our mental health. But she didn’t seem very compassionate or understanding.I asked ‘Am I being detained? Because if not I would like to enjoy the rest of my afternoon and you are harassing me.’She asked me to give my name and when I refused – because I had committed no crime – she arrested me.I was handcuffed and taken to a police station in Wrexham. I was locked in an interrogation room. A police sergeant told me he could hold me for 24 hours if I refused to cooperate.I said: ‘I do not consent. I took my family for an icecream.’At this point the police sergeant got really angry and frustrated and bullying. He shouted in my face: ‘I’m in charge and I give the orders.’ Then he told me I was going to be strip searched, which really shocked me.After about 45 minutes two different officers appeared. I said: ‘Please will you loosen my right handcuff because it’s really tight and stopping my circulation?’ They refused. Then I said: ‘I need to use the bathroom.’ They said: ‘Not until we are finished.’I was taken to a custody cell where there was an exposed toilet. I asked for some privacy and some toilet paper. The sergeant said: ‘No shit for him until we are finished.’They asked me what my clothes size was. I told them I was happy in my own clothes.Then they came in with a pair of scissors and said that if I didn’t cooperate they would cut my clothes and forcibly remove them from me.At which point I agreed to do what they said. I stood naked in front of them. Well, not totally naked: first I changed out of my top, then out of my bottoms. But I’d say that standing with your genitalia exposed while two men look at you counts as naked.It’s the sort of thing you might have expected in Nazi Germany – but not in a civilised modern democracy.After three hours I was released with no charges, and no penalty. It had all been for nothing.Kotlarek’s case has been taken up by a member of the Welsh Assembly, Neil McEvoy MS.McEvoy is an anti-lockdown campaigner who has himself had run-ins with the local police, caught on film harassing him after he was distributing political leaflets while campaigning to oust Wales’s hard-left chief minister Mark Drakeford. Drakeford has been responsible for probably the most draconian lockdown regulations in the United Kingdom.McEvoy said of Kotlarek’s case: “It’s outrageous but it’s a sign of the times. The police have become very authoritarian and no more so than in Wales.”North Wales Police have issued a statement on the incident.Following the circulation of a video and many subsequent comments on social media, Chief Superintendent Nigel Harrison said:The person was spoken to at Talacre beach as officers reasonably suspected he had committed an offence, which in this case was a breach in Coronavirus regulations.The man, who is from the seaside town of Rhos on Sea some 22 miles away, was arrested because his details could not be ascertained at the time in order to be reported for the suspected breach.The officers behaved in a calm and reasonable way as I would have expected.As is always the case, if the individual wishes to query or complain about the way they were treated then of course we will review the full circumstances.Kotlarek is now seeking legal advice.He told Breitbart News:It was humiliating. But this isn’t about me or about getting revenge. I just don’t want to live in a society in which the most basic human rights are not respected and where people are treated like animals.HealthLaw and OrderLondon / EuropeArrestedbeachcoronavirusIce CreamRadek KotlarekUnited KingdomWalesWelsh police.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
683,"Scientists from at least thirty-three universities in the United Kingdom have worked with Chinese military researchers on the development of nuclear weapons, an investigation has claimed.Top academics, including those at the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh and Manchester, have reportedly worked alongside researchers at China’s top nuclear weapons research institution, the Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP).According to The Telegraph, academics from at least thirty-three UK universities have published papers alongside Chinese researchers at the CAEP or its subsidiaries. Some of the British scientists are believed to have even accepted positions at the Chinese institution.The CAEP and its underlings have all been placed on America’s sanction list for their role in developing the communist regime’s nuclear arsenal and advanced weapons technologies. The CAEP and its subsidiaries are also all under the supervision of China’s Central Military Council, which is chaired by Chinese dictator Xi Jinping.The report went on to claim that the British taxpayer could be in fact funding Beijing’s weapons programmes, as many of the joint projects between the UK and Chinese researchers have taken advantage of UK government grants and taxpayer-funded facilities.This includes the use of the United Kingdom’s national supercomputer, known as ARCHER, as well as the Diamond Light Source, a £260 million particle accelerator.The report claimed that academics at Edinburgh University, Queen Mary University of London, and Cambridge University have all been tied to a CAEP laboratory that studies “shock wave and detonation physics”.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute said that the CAEP’s four main objectives are to “nuclear weapons; research microwaves and lasers for nuclear fusion ignition and directed-energy weapons; study technologies related to conventional weapons; and deepen military-civil fusion.”The defence think tank went on to claim that the CAEP is looking to expand “its international presence in order to attract leading talent to assist China’s development of nuclear weapons.”Report: UK Likely Funding Chinese Communist Military Through Joint University Projects https://t.co/Sh74XVN5kf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 2, 2020The universities all said that their research was in line with UK law and that the projects were not for military use.However, former Foreign Office official Charles Parton said: “It is an extremely bad idea to cooperate with an institute that develops nuclear weapons.”The chair of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat said: “Some universities’ apparent lack of curiosity about their partners leaves them exposed to accusations of collusion with hostile states, violating human rights, and undermining the security of the UK.“Clearly they need to realise their responsibility but the Government also has an essential role in making sure they’re aware of the consequences arising from these partnerships.”British Universities have come under increasing scrutiny for their ties to the Chinese Communist Party, with MI6 reportedly investigating “some of the most prestigious universities in the country” for potentially violating national security laws through their work with Chinese weapons developers.Some 200 British academics are also reportedly under investigation for allegedly sharing military technology with the communist regime.REVEALED: Cambridge University and the BBC have become the latest British establishment institutions accused of working in step with China. https://t.co/I2f8lNBwwj— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 10, 2021One of the professors named in the latest investigation as being tied to the CAEP was Prof Simon Redfern, the former head of the Earth Science department at Cambridge University, now based in Singapore.In 2016, Redfern took a role as a visiting professor with the CAEP subsidiary dubbed “HPSTAR”, going on to publish 15 papers with the Chinese researchers, while he was still serving on two British government science bodies and receiving public funding for his work.Prof Redfern was also given an award from China’s Thousands Talents plan, a programme which has been tied to the theft of sensitive technologies across the world, most notably in America.Last year, for example, former Harvard Professor Charles Lieber was indicted for failing to disclose his financial relationship with the Wuhan University of Technology as a part of the Thousand Talents scheme.The author of a report from Civitas on the ties between British universities and the Chinese state, Radomir Tylecote, described the latest findings as a “major national scandal” and went on to call for the British government to create an American-style sanction list to bar the partnerships from continuing into the future.Farage: China Launching 'Communist Takeover' as CCP-Linked Firms Buy UK Schools https://t.co/dzEOpXb9Ms— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaAsiaLondon / EuropeNational SecurityBritish universitiescambridge universityCCPChinachinese militaryChinese military technologynuclear weaponstechnology transferThousand TalentsUK educationUnited KingdomUniversity of Edinburghuseful idiotsXi Jinping.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

686,"PRAGUE (AP) – Police and military forces in the Czech Republic set up 500 checkpoints across the country as one of the European Union’s hardest-hit nations marked the first anniversary of its coronavirus outbreak on Monday by significantly limiting free movement.Some 30,000 officers were involved in an unprecedented operation to enforce a tight new restriction that bans people from traveling to other counties unless they go to work or have to take care of relatives.It’s part of a series of measures that took effect Monday as the Central European nation seeks to slow down the spread of a highly contagious virus variant first found in Britain.Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the measure´s goal was to prevent the country’s hospitals from collapsing under the stress of caring for COVID-19 patients.Amid a surge of infections from the U.K. variant, of the 7,049 COVID-19 patients in Czech hospitals on Sunday, 1,507 needed intensive care. Both the numbers are close to the records set earlier last week.Since the Czech Republic registered the first three people infected with coronavirus on March 1 last year, the nation of 10.7 million has see over 1.24 million confirmed cases with 20,469 deaths.The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen from 70.75 new cases per 100,000 people on Feb. 14 to 109.82 per 100,000 people on Sunday, the worst per-capita rate in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University.As of Monday, people in the Czech Republic who go out for exercise should not leave their municipality. Nursery schools and schools for children with disabilities were also closed while only stores selling essential goods remain open.Experts, however, say the measures don´t go far enough to stop the virus.“I consider the most important measures those that haven´t been applied,” biochemist Jan Trnka told the Czech Public radio. “That is to limit contacts at work, especially in the industry.”Only on Monday did the Czech government start to require mass testing of employees on a voluntary basis. That was expected to become mandatory Friday in companies with more than 250 workers.Industry and Trade Minister Karel Havlicek has rejected calls to close at least some plants and factories as “unrealistic.”Meanwhile, the country is speeding up its vaccination program with general practitioners joining inoculation centers. Over 650,000 vaccine doses have been given out. Babis said 1 million vaccine shots were expected to arrive through an EU program in March and another 2.6 million in April.In a sign of solidarity, three states in neighboring Germany have sent the Czech Republic 15,000 dozes of the AstraZeneca vaccine to try to control contagion at the border.Babis and pro-Russian President Milos Zeman also said they would use Russia´s Sputnik V vaccine even if it´s not approved by the European Medicines Agency.HealthLondon / EuropecoronavirusCzech RepublicEuropean Unionlockdown.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
687,"The European Union will introduce legislation to introduce a vaccine passport this month, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced on Monday.In a statement released on social media, von der Leyen said that the vaccine passport will provide proof that a person has been vaccinated, results of tests for those who couldn’t get a vaccine yet, and information related to a successful recovery from the Chinese virus.The vaccine passport has been dubbed the “Digital Green Pass”, presumably after the Israeli scheme of the same name. Greece, which has been one of the main proponents of the scheme, already signed a ‘trial run‘ of a Green Pass system with Israel last month.The EU Commission president claimed that the vaccine passport “will respect data protection, security [and] privacy,” adding: “the Digital Green Pass should facilitate Europeans‘ lives.”“The aim is to gradually enable them to move safely in the European Union or abroad – for work or tourism,” von der Leyen wrote.The introduction of a vaccine passport was signalled last week by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who claimed that “everyone agreed that we need a digital vaccination certificate,” following a virtual EU coronavirus summit on Thursday.Merkel said that such a system could be put in place before the summer holiday season, but cautioned that a vaccine passport should not “mean that only those who have a vaccination passport are allowed to travel.”The move to introduce the legislation has apparently caught some within the bloc off guard, however, with Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sophie Wilmès writing: “For Belgium, there is no question of linking vaccination to the freedom of movement around Europe.“Respect for the principle of non-discrimination is more fundamental than ever since vaccination is not compulsory and access to the vaccine is not yet generalized.”It’s things like this that make me get up in the morning 🌞 I want to thank the tyrants for all their hard work 🙏 #StopVaccinePassports https://t.co/6SYXKl4zm2— Silkie Carlo (@silkiecarlo) March 1, 2021According to The Telegraph,  Downing Street has indicated that Brexit Britain is already set to hold talks with the EU over the passport scheme.“We have said that we are looking at the issue of vaccine passports. As you can expect, DfT (the Department for Transport) will work and do speak to countries across the world in terms of how they may look to introduce passports,” the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.“Of course you can expect us to speak to the EU and other countries on how they may implement any similar sorts of policies,” the spokesman added.After months of denying coronavirus vaccine passports would be deployed domestically, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has begun to signal that it will look to require Britons to carry papers in order to go to the pub or the theatre.Cabinet Minister Michael Gove — who has previously ouright denied that the government would implement such draconian measures — has been tapped by Mr Johnson to research the development of a so-called ‘Covid Status Certification’ vaccine passport.Mr Johnson defended the idea by saying: “I know the fervent libertarians will object but other people will think that there is case for it.”Vaccine Passports Could be Used in Supermarkets Suggests UK Foreign Secretary https://t.co/I6BWrbvLZd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthImmigrationLondon / EuropeBoris JohnsoncoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineCOVID-19Downing StreetEUEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionUnited KingdomUrsula von der LeyenVaccinevaccine passportVaccine Passportsvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
688,"A member of the British government’s scientific advisory panel has implied that the prime minister’s timetable for lifting lockdown could be set back if Britons take advantage of any rare warm Spring weather and undertake allegedly risky business such as going to the beach or meeting up with friends.Professor Calum Semple, who sits on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said people gathering represented a “big worry” for his colleagues and the government, claiming it could undo the progress made by Britons spending a year under lockdown.“Really, we do urge people to take care. We’re just not quite there on the road map — we can’t take a short cut with people’s health,” Professor Semple told Sky News on Sunday.He added that while going outside for “exercise” is still allowed in twos, so-called “clustering”, the outbreaks expert said — depicting “large parties on the beach or parks for picnics”  and other such “inadvertent activities” — could drive up the cases of the virus.Semple said that “it just takes a few families…. and we can kick off outbreaks,” adding: “We’re so close but we could blow it by breaking the rules now.”The SAGE advisor’s claim that Britons were on the brink of causing more clusters of infections come as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that some 20 million Britons had had their first dose of the vaccine against Chinese coronavirus, with new evidence suggesting that even a single dose reduces hospital admission by 90 per cent.220,000+ Brits Sign Petition Against Vaccine Passports, Forcing Debate in Parliament https://t.co/lUKOm2eWfD— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 27, 2021Further, his remarks that “large parties on the beach” could drive outbreaks contradict verbal evidence given to the House of Commons just two weeks ago by Professor Mark Woolhouse, who belongs to a SAGE subgroup, when he said that the “virus is not transmitted well outdoors”. Woolhouse also confirmed that, specifically, there had been no outbreaks linked to crowded beaches during good weather.“Over the summer, we were treated to all this on the television news and pictures of crowded beaches and there was an outcry about this.“There were no outbreaks linked to crowded beaches. There’s never been a Covid-19 outbreak linked to a beach ever anywhere in the world to the best of my knowledge,” said the member of SAGE’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M).Britain’s police were out over the weekend reinforcing effective house arrest messages such as those conveyed by Professor Semple, with South Wales Police pulling over drivers to interrogate them on whether they were travelling to any beauty spots, while Brighton and Hove Police were questioning people sitting on the beach.It is not the first time that scientists influencing the government told Britons to cancel their normal interactions with seasonal changes and events, including in December when citizens were told to postpone Christmas until the Summer or even put off seeing some relatives until even later in 2021 after people had been vaccinated. This latest warning comes months earlier than equivalent messages put out by the government last year, which launched a scare campaign to put people off going outside.Breitbart London reported in April 2020 when the government pre-empted a “mini-heatwave” weekend, telling the public: “this weekend give the beach a miss.

689,"Nearly two-thirds of Austrians believe that the economic consequences of Wuhan coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions will be worse for people’s lives than the virus itself.An Austrian Gallup Institute online survey of 1,000 Austrians found that 65 per cent of respondents agreed with the statement that the economic consequences of the Wuhan coronavirus lockdowns would destroy the lives of people more than the virus, up from 41 per cent the year before.The February 2021 poll also found that Austrians have become less confident in the government’s approach to the pandemic in comparison to governments of other European Union member states, with just 28 per cent saying Austria has done a better job than other EU countries, ORF reported on Monday.According to the broadcaster, Austria has seen far more economic damage due to the pandemic. The country more heavily relies on the tourism sector compared to some other EU members and  a lot of Austrians were spending abroad with the rise of online shopping trends.Police in Austria have banned 15 of 17 planned demonstrations against government coronavirus lockdown measures, including a major protest in Vienna this weekend. https://t.co/wEAxS6VlTA— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 30, 2021Climate change policy remains an important topic to Austrians despite the pandemic, with 43 per cent stating that the government should push climate change action immediately. In comparison, 32 per cent said the country was facing more pressing issues, and climate change action could wait.Andrea Fronaschütz, head of Gallup in Austria, commented on the results, saying: “Among more and more people, there is a feeling that there will be no return to the status quo, but at the same time the future is uncertain.

690,"As warmer and calmer weather on the Mediterranean approaches, the new Italian government is conflicted on illegal immigration as Matteo Salvini’s ally becomes undersecretary to the interior minister.Salvini, the League’s leader, has sent Nicola Molteni to take up the position of undersecretary to the current Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese on Monday, a position Molteni held when Salvini served as interior minister in the first government of former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.Molteni, who was supportive of Salvini’s anti-mass migration decrees, has promised to work with the current leftist minister for the interior in the new government led by former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi but has also called for a “change of course” as migrant numbers have risen, Il Giornale reports.Salvini said that he and the League would support the Draghi government, but stipulated: “We will have to change strategy, even with the ports wide open.”Interior Minister Lamorgese, meanwhile, has not signalled any change in her policies which have resulted in a dramatic rise in the number of new arrivals since she became the head of the Interior Ministry in the second government of Giuseppe Conte.Italy: Migrant Landings Up 948 Per Cent Under Post-Salvini Leftist Govt https://t.co/tKO8GXCVa3— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 1, 2020According to Italian media, Prime Minister Draghi is looking towards a European Union solution to illegal migration into Italy and has previously spoken to the Italian senate about his desire to back an EU migration pact.“A challenge will be the negotiation on the new Pact for Migration and Asylum, in which we will pursue a decisive strengthening of the balance between the responsibilities of the countries of first entry and effective solidarity,” Draghi told senators last month.“The construction of a European return policy for those not entitled to international protection will also be crucial, alongside full respect for the rights of refugees,” he added.Over the last several years, the European Union has made attempts for a unified agreement on illegal migration, often with the proposal of redistribution of illegal migrants to release pressure from border states such as Italy and Greece.These negotiations have largely failed as countries such as Poland and Hungary have rejected the redistribution of migrants to their countries.People traffickers in the Mediterranean sea are allegedly using pregnant women as “weapons” to encourage public sympathy for mass migration. https://t.co/LjhEnYagTp— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 25, 2021ImmigrationLondon / EuropeEuropean UnionItalyLuciana LamorgeseMario DraghiMass MigrationMatteo SalviniMediterranean migrant route.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
691,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage said that former President Donald Trump’s speech at CPAC cemented his position as the leader of the Republican Party, hailing the return of a true “opposition” in the United States.Mr Farage said that following Trump’s speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Sunday, it is clear that “Trump’s grip on the Republican Party seems to be as strong as ever”.“I will be the first to acknowledge that we are talking about a cult of personality here, but that is because, in 2021, it is Donald Trump’s Republican Party,” Farage wrote for Newsweek, predicting that Trump will further solidify his power within the party through winning battles against so-called RINOs in Washington DC.Mr Farage said the speech also secured Trump’s role as the true opposition leader in the United States, something which the Brexit leader said has been sorely missing from American politics.The U.S. has not had much in the way of “opposition leadership” for several years, Farage explained, adding that the lack of a credible opposition is “unhealthy in any democracy”.“Following Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016, there was a vacuum at the top of the Democratic Party that was filled by CNN and The New York Times. By the time Joe Biden won the nomination, the campaign was in full swing and the key message was simply ‘Vote for me, not the other guy,'” Farage said.The leader of the Brexit movement and the recently renamed Reform UK party said that Mr Trump “has what it takes to do the job well”.“Trump made it clear how he intends to use his new role. He will hold Biden’s administration to account and he will not shy away from criticizing it when he has to. It’s true that opposition leadership is, in certain ways, easier than being in charge, but it requires considerable amounts of energy and skill to be a truly effective opposition leader,” Farage said.Farage Praises Trump as ‘Bravest Person’ He’d Ever Met, Who Stands Up for Patriotism, Against Globalism https://t.co/65xBMqWRBq— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 29, 2020Mr Farage has himself acted as a de facto opposition leader in the United Kingdom for years, representing the only credible challenger to the Tories. His voice — from outside of government — successfully forced the then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron into calling for the 2016 EU referendum, which, albeit belatedly, resulted in the UK leaving the European Union.The Brexit leader can also credibly claim to have ‘decapitated’ the British government twice. He took down two sitting Prime Ministers — David Cameron after he lost the referendum to Mr Farage, and Theresa May after she lost the EU elections on the back of her failure to deliver Brexit to Mr Farage — more than the official opposition Labour party can claim to have achieved in over a decade.“Strong opposition leadership is about more than just complaining,” the arch Brexiteer said, explaining: “The essence of it is offering solutions to problems that voters care about. With this in mind, whether you dispute last November’s election result or think that Trump is a sore loser, he was right to point out that the need for electoral reform in America is urgent.”He noted that Trump’s electoral reforms represent “tangible” policies that can be taken up by state legislatures throughout the country.“If the Democrats oppose election transparency, they will need to marshal some very powerful arguments to convince the electorate that it is a good idea to maintain a broken system that damages America’s reputation around the world. This is the sort of reforming idea that will serve Trump well,” Farage predicted.He went on to say that Trump’s call for regulations on Big Tech censorship, such as his demand for the repeal of Section 230 and the breakup of the Silicon Valley monopolies, could also prove to be “very fertile territory”. He explained that neither Democrat nor Republican voters want to be “controlled by a corporation”.Farage said that Trump’s biggest challenge going forward will be reaching his voter base. In light of the Masters of the Universe tech companies marching in lockstep to censor the former president from their social media platforms, he said that it is unclear through which means Trump will get his message out.Without the ability to communicate over the internet, Mr Farage said, both Brexit and Trump’s victory in 2016 would never have occurred.“For now, what is clear is that Trump’s CPAC speech was disciplined and persuasive. It marked the start of a genuine period of opposition leadership, something that any functioning democracy should welcome. It was not so much a case of ‘Trump is back’ as a case of ‘Trump never went away'”, Farage concluded.Farage: ‘Those Who Bet The House Against Donald Trump Generally Lose’ https://t.co/TNhMvVxBlS— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 6, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulka2020 ElectionLondon / EuropePolitics2020 election2020 presidential electionCPACCPAC 2020Donald TrumpElectoral ReformJoe BidenNigel FarageRepublican PartyTech Censorship.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

That is really important to reduce the virus transmission both from you to others and others to you,” Hopkins added, according to The Times.She then appeared to suggest that double masking could be coming to the United Kingdom, describing discussions about mask regulations as “ongoing”: “We have got a facemasks and face coverings advisory group who meet on a regular basis and look at new and emerging evidence. The U.S. has looked at some of that evidence as well.“We are in an ongoing discussion about what to do next.

693,"PARIS (AP) – A Paris court on Monday found French former President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of corruption and influence peddling and sentenced him to one year in prison and a two-year suspended sentence.The 66-year-old politician, who was president from 2007 to 2012, was convicted for having tried to illegally obtain information from a senior magistrate in 2014 about a legal action in which he was involved.The court said Sarkozy is entitled to request to be detained at home with an electronic bracelet.This is the first time in France´s modern history that a former president has been convicted of corruption.Former French Prez Sarkozy Faces Prison Over Corruption Case, Verdict Expected Monday https://t.co/35BcHLDV3q— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 1, 2021Sarkozy´s co-defendants – his lawyer and longtime friend Thierry Herzog, 65, and now-retired magistrate Gilbert Azibert, 74 – were also found guilty and given the same sentence as the politician.The court found that Sarkozy and his co-defendants sealed a “pact of corruption,” based on “consistent and serious evidence”.The court said the facts were “particularly serious” given that they were committed by a former president who used his status to help a magistrate who had served his personal interest. In addition, as a lawyer by training, he was “perfectly informed” about committing an illegal action, the court said.Sarkozy had firmly denied all the allegations against him during the 10-day trial that took place at the end of last year.The corruption trial focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014.At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of the 2007 presidential campaign. During the investigation they incidentally discovered that Sarkozy and Herzog were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias “Paul Bismuth.”Conversations wiretapped on these phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case, known by the name of France´s richest woman, L´Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.Former French Prez Sarkozy Detained over Alleged Millions Received from Libya’s Gaddafi  https://t.co/fQeAHDR7bm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 20, 2018In one of these phone calls with Herzog, Sarkozy said of Azibert : “I´ll make him move up … I´ll help him.”In another, Herzog reminded Sarkozy to “say a word” for Azibert during a trip to Monaco.Legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the Bettencourt case. Azibert never got the Monaco job.Prosecutors have concluded, however, that the “clearly stated promise” constitutes in itself a corruption offense under French law, even if the promise wasn’t fulfilled.Sarkozy vigorously denied any malicious intention.He told the court that his political life was all about “giving (people) a little help. That all it is, a little help,” he said during the trial.The confidentiality of communications between a lawyer and his client was a major point of contention in the trial.“You have in front of you a man of whom more that 3,700 private conversations have been wiretapped… What did I do to deserve that?” Sarkozy said during the trial.Sarkozy´s defense lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont, argued the whole case was based on “small talk” between a lawyer and his client.Sarkozy Would Offer UK New EU Treaty if He Wins French Presidency https://t.co/HSHbr5Zt7s pic.twitter.com/QE0ZAnQHlH— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 28, 2016The court concluded that the use of wiretapped conversations was legal as long as they helped show evidence of corruption-related offenses.Sarkozy withdrew from active politics after failing to be chosen as his conservative party´s presidential candidate for France´s 2017 election, won by Emmanuel Macron.He remains very popular amid right-wing voters, however, and plays a major role behind the scenes, including through maintaining a relationship with Macron, whom he is said to advise on certain topics. His memoirs published last year, “The Time of Storms,” was a bestseller for weeks.Sarkozy will face another trial later this month along with 13 other people on charges of illegal financing of his 2012 presidential campaign.His conservative party is suspected of having spent 42.8 million euros ($50.7 million), almost twice the maximum authorized, to finance the campaign, which ended in victory for Socialist rival Francois Hollande.In another investigation opened in 2013, Sarkozy is accused of having taken millions from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his 2007 campaign.He was handed preliminary charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of stolen assets from Libya and criminal association.

694,"There has been a wave of oral cancers being caught at later stages because dentists did not pick up early signs due to Chinese coronavirus lockdown closures.The UK suspended dental services during the first shutdown in March 2020, with access to regular appointments not resumed until June 8th.Matthew Garrett from the Royal College of Surgeons has said that because many patients were forced to use phone or video conference consultations in all but serious dental cases and emergencies, dental practitioners were not able to pick up on the subtle changes to soft tissue in the mouth, or other neck or head conditions which could have meant catching some cancers early.“Anecdotally, patients are now presenting later with more advanced oral cancer, which means the tumours are larger and surgery is more complicated,” Mr Garrett said, according to a Times report on Monday.The newspaper of record states that while dental practices have resumed services — albeit with restrictions as a result of government regulations to ensure hygiene and social distancing standards — patients remain reticent to go to the dentist or other medical settings.Cost of Lockdown: Heart Charity Claims Hundreds of Excess Deaths Due to Lockdown https://t.co/Uf5D6kiLod— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 15, 2020A November report on the rise of stillbirths pointed to a similar reluctance from expectant mothers in the later stages of their pregnancies to seek help if they experienced problems, either through fear of going to hospital and catching coronavirus or thinking that they would present a burden to the NHS.A report from Cardiff University and Cancer Research UK released last week revealed that during the first lockdown, almost half of those who had a suspected symptom of cancer did not go to the GP for help, again, because they did not want to overstretch the National Health Service, with researchers finding, according to The Guardian, that Britons were put off by the government’s “stay home, protect the NHS, save lives” message.People “put their health concerns on hold to protect the NHS”, one of the study’s researchers said, with the paper finding that 44.8 per cent of Britons who had at least one suspected cancer symptom between March and August did not seek medical help, including those who had ‘red flag’ symptoms such as coughing up blood (30.7 per cent), noticing a change in the appearance of a mole (58.6 per cent), or discovering a swelling or lump (41 per cent).Report: Cancer Patients Decry Deadly Delays and Cancellations Due to Focus on Covid https://t.co/zHMUbNya4G— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2020With some ten million backlogged dentist appointments, the British Dental Association believes that it could take months, or even years, to catch up.Healthwatch England, a health and social care services watchdog, released a report revealing that “people have been asked to wait for up to two years to see an NHS dentist.”The Times also reported on Monday that the chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Agnes Ayton, warned that delays to accessing support to mental health services were putting eating disorder patients’ lives at risk.Waiting times for a bed at a facility in Dr Ayton’s area had increased from three to four weeks to two months, while non-urgent patients have been told they may have to wait two years.Last month, UK mental health professionals warned that lockdown was “damaging” children, with hospitals seeing an increase in children arriving at Accident and Emergency in mental health crises, with those self-harming getting younger.‘Protect the NHS’ Message that Scared Away Patients Could Contribute to Extra Deaths: Report https://t.co/I1ioy3QkhB— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 19, 2020HealthLondon / EuropeSciencecancercoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownNational Health ServiceNHSsocial distancingUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
695,"Home Secretary Priti Patel is reportedly set to announce that people smugglers will face life sentences, in the latest attempt to deal with the ongoing Channel migrant crisis.Under current law, people smugglers only face a maximum sentence of fourteen years. However, as with most criminals jailed in the UK, they are unlikely to serve their full term, with most typically serving less than five years behind bars.Patel is looking to increase the penalty to a maximum sentence of life, which would prohibit the smugglers from being able to qualify for automatic early release, according to The Times.The move, which is expected to be introduced legislatively later this year, would primarily target low-end traffickers, including those who actually steer the migrant boats.A Home Office source told the paper: “At the moment the 14-year maximum sentence does constrain obviously what judges can do because that narrows the range of sentences available.“We’re not naive enough to imagine that every trial judge is going to be handing down a life sentence for anyone who’s convicted of people smuggling but by having that option available then hopefully we’ll see [life sentences] used in the worst cases, and then in other cases we will start seeing the 12, 15, 20-year sentences that these people aren’t getting at the moment.“We need the starting point for all of these serious sentences to be much higher and that means the top end has to be at the very highest and that means a life sentence.”The upcoming legislation will also focus on preventing migrants from filing last-minute asylum claims after they have already been rejected. Last year, little over one hundred failed asylum seekers who crossed the Channel by boat or tunnel were returned back to Europe.There is some question as to the effectiveness of increased sentencing guidelines will have in stopping the flow of illegal migrants, with a government source saying: “It’s all very well having very stiff sentences but detection is the big problem. A lot of people who work on people smuggling are obviously not in the UK.”Brexit leader Nigel Farage also expressed cynicism over the move, writing: “More tough talk but this will not stem the flow. The invasion this year will be even bigger than 2020.”Report: Illegal Boat Migrants Sign Slave Labour ‘Pact’ with Traffickers to Reach UK https://t.co/XwrAXiDP8m— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 21, 2020The report from The Times also revealed the demographics of the migrants who illegally landed in the UK by boat last year. Iranians made up the largest block, representing 14 per cent, followed by Albanians with ten per cent, Eritreans at 8 per cent, and Iraqis at 7 per cent.The rest of the main nationalities included: “Sudanese (7 per cent), Syrian (5 per cent), Afghan (4.5 per cent), Pakistani (4.1 per cent) and Vietnamese (3.2 per cent).”On Monday, the British tabloid The Sun claimed to have witnessed a French warship escorting a boat full of migrants into British territorial waters, backing up reporting of the same from Brexit leader Nigel Farage.The paper claimed that the French naval vessel “turned back when it was well inside UK waters,” adding that the British Border Force picked up the migrants after the rubber dingy ran out of fuel. Breitbart London has previously reported on similar excursions by French government ships.A source told the tabloid that people smugglers are intentionally sending off boats from the French coast with just enough fuel to reach British territorial waters in order to force a rescue.“The people traffickers, hellbent on making as much profit as possible, are only filling up the petrol tanks halfway,” the source said, adding: “This is ruthless.”100 People-Smuggling Gangs Running Illegal Migrant Routes to the UK, Says French Investigator https://t.co/6wlF7Lt2zO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 23, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaCrimeImmigrationLondon / Europeasylum seekersBoat MigrantsChannel CrisisChannel MigrantsdiversityEnglish ChannelEurope Migrant Crisishome officehuman traffickersHuman TraffickingIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationIllegal MigrantsMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant CrisisMulticulturalismNigel FaragePeople smugglerspeople smugglingpriti patelSocial CohesionUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
696,"A seasoned German journalist has said that his home country is currently experiencing “unfamiliar feelings of post-Brexit envy” as “Brexit Britain races ahead” in its vaccine programme.Thomas Kielinger, the UK correspondent for the German daily Die Welt, described Germany, hitherto heralded for its “much-attested organisational skill” being hit at “the very core of its psyche” after the United Kingdom, which had only just left the Teutonic nation’s “ersatz identity” the EU, speeding along and vaccinating some 20 million people while Germany struggles to cover a fraction of its population.Blaming in part the nature of Germany’s governmental structure — 17 states, comprised of 16 regional and one national — Mr Kielinger nevertheless evokes the concerns of Germans who wonder “why couldn’t their leaders come up with an orderly way of distributing the vaccines?”, adding in an opinion piece for Britain’s Telegraph that the country’s former defence minister and current President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, “has hardly improved matters, overseeing a mess in Brussels even worse than that in her homeland”.In fact, so great has Germany’s anxiety grown over its slow vaccine programme, that it has come up with a word for it: “impfneid” (“vaccine envy”)– the sense of resentment when someone has been vaccinated, but not you.‘Dear Britain, We Envy You!’: Top German Newspaper Congratulates UK Vaccine Rollout https://t.co/Ljk6wRryj7— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 25, 2021The remarks follow a recent pattern of German journalists openly criticising and mocking the EU’s and Germany’s failure to roll out a successful vaccine programme, with Europe’s best-selling tabloid Bild penning the headline for an article on the front page of its February 24th print edition: “Dear Britain, WE ENVY YOU!”In January, Bild had hailed former U.S. President Donald Trump, Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, and Britain’s Boris Johnson as “vaccine masters”, adding that “Brexit Boris laid the foundation for vaccination success”. While the German tabloid’s editor Peter Tiede added that the EU’s vaccine fiasco, fueled by a bloated bureaucracy that demanded control of drugs procurement for the whole bloc, was “the biggest confidence-destroying programme in its history”.Mr Kielinger continued to write that “nobody waxes enthusiastic about the EU any more, and the notion of ever-closer union has evaporated.”He continued: “But Germans are accustomed to Europe as their ersatz identity and political job description, quite apart from enjoying a club with such significant, if endangered, economic clout. Thus they have only ever conceived of Brexit as an act of extreme, self-inflicted harm. Lately, however, they have been disabused of this notion. John Kampfner’s 2020 book, Why the Germans Do It Better: Notes from a Grown-Up Country has virtually been turned on its head.”The United Kingdom has overtaken the European Union in the total number of people given a vaccination shot against coronavirus, despite having less than a sixth of the population to inoculate. https://t.co/IgioJRxrwB— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 12, 2021“Eat your gloomy predictions, ye staunch anti-Brexiteers,” said the German Welt correspondent, likely alluding to those in the British establishment media which predicted last year that the UK would fall behind in vaccinating its population because it had left the bloc.Britain’s Observer — the Sunday newspaper of choice for the anti-Brexit intelligentsia — also hit these themes last week in a self-deprecating piece titled “I hate to say it, but Britain’s doing OK. Even Germany envies us…”.Taking a tour of the recent headlines which have had diehard-remainers eating their own words, the piece noted: “For diehard Remoaners like me, all this endless good news about jabs and carbon emissions is pretty hard to take… While Eeyorish Mrs Merkel warns of yet another lockdown, with less than 10% of her population vaccinated, our flaxen-haired prime minister leads his nation towards a summer of Weimar excess. Mutti, how could you forsake your fans in Islington like this?”.Meanwhile in Europe, the bloc’s ‘vaccine solidarity’ has also evaporated, with Austria and Denmark announcing on Tuesday that it would cease to rely solely on Brussels for its vaccine solutions and would work with Israel on the next generation of vaccinations targeting COVID-19 mutations.Last month Hungary, which strongly criticised the EU’s vaccine rollout, became the first country in Europe to offer the Chinese vaccine after earlier authorising the use of Russia’s Sputnik V.Germany’s Angela Merkel said at the beginning of February that “every vaccine is welcome in the European Union”, following reports of Sputnik V’s “good data”, adding that she had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the vaccine.“And what did the EU do?

A daft policy, if ever there was one.”An Australian-style points-based immigration system post-Brexit was long demanded by veteran Leave campaigners such as Nigel Farage, and promised by latecomers to the cause like Boris Johnson, who only joined in 2016.However, as Migration Watch have pointed out, the points-based system proposed by the Johnson administration lacks the key feature of the Australian system, namely a fixed cap on annual inflow — meaning it could well lead to a significant increase in immigration, not a reduction.Prime Minister is also overseeing other relaxations of the already limited controls on immigration, for example by lowering salary thresholds and the requirement to advertise jobs locally.‘Give British Workers a Chance!’ Think Tank Bashes Plan to Import Millions of Workers During Economic Crisis https://t.co/mlrb6mZRR9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 1, 2020ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsAlp MehmetBoris JohnsonBritainConservative Partyforeign workersmass immigrationMass Migrationmigrant workersMigrantsmigration watchMigration Watch UKRishi SunakToriesTory partyUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
698,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
699,"A review of statues, place names, and other memorials inspired by Black Lives Matter in Edinburgh, Scotland, has figures including Queen Victoria, Admiral Nelson, and even Scotland’s national poet, Robert ‘Rabbie’ Burns, in its sights, according to reports.The Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group, commissioned by the Scottish capital’s municipal government — a coalition between the left-separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) and the left-wing Labour Party — has even named Bute House, the official residence of SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, as a site of “historic racial injustice”, according to the Telegraph, because its builders inherited some wealth from Caribbean plantations.Burns, famous around the world as the Bard of Ayrshire, with a statue adorning Central Park in Manhattan, New York, was targeted by the review despite supporting the abolition of slavery because he once “accepted a job working on a Jamaican plantation in a role he described as a ‘Negro driver’” — although he never actually followed through on the job.David Hume, an icon of the Scottish Enlightenment and something of a progressive thinker for his day, has also been singled out for occasionally expressing views that would be considered insensitive by the standards of 2021 — over three centuries on from the year of his birth. The Univesity of Edinburgh has already renamed Hume Tower, which took its moniker from its once-celebrated former student.Statue of Queen Elizabeth II Beheaded in Victoria, Canada https://t.co/vwXnp74h7O— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 26, 2021Admiral Horatio Nelson, hero of the Battle of Trafalgar, was accused — dubiously — of opposing the abolition of the slave trade, while William Ewart Gladstone, who served four times as Prime Minister and was heralded as a leader approaching the stature of Sir Winston Churchill in a more historically literate era, was targeted because his father owned plantations in the Caribbean and British Guiana which at one time used slave labour.The dossier reportedly names Queen Victoria, likely the most iconic of Britain’s monarchs, simply because she was a “colonial ruler”.The Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group has been led by Sir Geoff Palmer, who is Scotland’s first black professor — but not a historian, having made his name as a grain scientist.Sir Geoff has previously campaigned against Henry Dundas — who also appears in the review — and successfully persuaded the authorities to “recontextualise” the stone column and statue memorialising him in Edinburgh with an information board which asserts that he was personally responsible for delaying the abolition of the slave trade and the deaths of thousands of slaves.Historians and descendants of Dundas have argued that the board is historically inaccurate, noting that Dundas never owned slaves, supported the gradual abolition of slavery, and had no means of effecting its immediate abolition.Dundas was one of the most powerful politicians of his day, with immense influence in the British government, and in his younger days helped to establish that slavery had no legal standing in Scotland proper as lawyer for the runaway slave Joseph Knight.Robert Poll of the Save Our Statues campaign described the Edinburgh Council review as a “Kangaroo Court of Scottish History” and dismissed Sir Geoff as “Another activist [re]writing history.”Edinburgh Castle Changing War Heroes’ Memorial After One Person Complained of ‘Imperialism’ https://t.co/GJHx5nBokx— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 20, 2020London / EuropePoliticsSocial Justiceacademic biasAdmiral Lord NelsonBlack Lives MatterBlack Lives Matter UKBLMBritainBritish cultureBritish HistoryCommunity CohesionDavid HumeedinburghEdinburgh CouncilGeoff PalmerHenry DundasHeritageHistoryHoratio NelsonIconoclasmlabourLabour Partyleft-wing academicsMulticulturalismQueen VictoriaRobert BurnsscotlandScottish HistoryScottish National PartyScottish National Party (SNP)SJWsSNPSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorsstatuesUnited KingdomWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
700,"Black Lives Matter supporting fast-fashion giant Boohoo and its suppliers are facing an import ban from the United States over allegations that the British-based company employs slave labour.During the height of the Black Lives Matter unrest in the U.S. and the UK last summer, Boohoo’s social media account took up the Hollywood trend of posting an image of a black square alongside the hashtag #blackouttuesday in supposed solidarity with the Marxist BLM movement.Just one month prior, however, the company was embroiled in a scandal over the use of alleged slave labour in its factories in the industrial British city of Leicester. Boohoo denies the claims.Now, the company is facing a possible investigation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection following a series of petitions launched by a campaign group that fights against modern-day slavery.British lawyer Duncan Jepson, who runs the Liberty Shared campaign group, told Sky News: “The evidence of Boohoo and forced labour is quite compelling. I think it will be a wake-up call for British institutions about how they’re handling modern slavery enforced labour, particularly in a community like Leicester East.“What we’d all like, those of us interested in improving labour conditions is for Boohoo to really get to grips with governance of their supply chain to ensure there is no wage theft and people have proper contracts.“It must look at all 11 indicators the International Labour Organisation sets out for forced labour and see there is compliance with those.”We're listening. #BlackOutTuesday pic.twitter.com/vIl6UMOsp6— boohoo (@boohoo) June 2, 2020The Tariff Act of 1930 in the United States prohibits the import of any foreign merchandise that has been “mined, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced or indentured labour” with products being liable to seizure or expulsion. Companies found responsible also face criminal investigations.The UK’s former anti-slavery commissioner Kevin Hyland said that if the United States determines there is modern slavery occurring in Boohoo’s supply chain in Leicester, then the potential sanctions from the US could be “enormous”.“The aim of the petitions is very clear, that companies which think they can benefit from forced labour and the exploitation of others are shown that they cannot and will face a sanction that they can’t trade in the world’s largest economy,” he said.“But what it will do as well is create a gap for good businesses to come in and pay people properly,” Hyland added.In 2020, American sales accounted for more than one-fifth of Boohoo’s total revenue, at £263.6 million ($366.72m). The company, founded in 2006, is believed to be one of the UK’s fastest-growing fashion brands, with some 14 million online customers.Despite the widely publicised accusations of modern slavery, the company saw its revenue rise by 40 per cent last year to £1.235bn, with £92.2 million in profits.Last July, an investigation from the Sunday Times claimed that workers at the Boohoo’s factories in Leicester were being paid as little as £3.50 an hour, less than 40 per cent of the national minimum wage for adults over 25 of £8.72 an hour.Delingpole: Slavery Is Still Rife in Britain. So Where Are the BLM Protests? https://t.co/wJCKu2H4Gv— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 14, 2020Home Secretary Priti Patel has suggested that “cultural sensitivities” led police and other government agencies to ignore the exploitation of illegal workers in textile factories and warehouses in Leicester, similar to how police overlooked grooming gang rapists operating in cities like Rotherham and Rochdale.Knowledge of modern-day slavery in the fast fashion factories of Leicester has been held since at least 2015. However, the police have been accused of being reticent to crack down on the trade out of politically correct fears.The issue has also been tied to illegal immigration, with a report from the Centre for Social Justice finding that trafficking networks are thought to be working with local criminals in order to exploit illegal immigrants from the Middle East and Eastern Europe, who are trapped in “debt bondage” accumulated during their journey to enter the UK illegally.The chairman of the Textile Manufacturers Association of Leicestershire, Saeed Khilji, claimed that have conditions in the factories have since improved.“If the American government took action and if they have enough evidence to do that, yes there will be an effect, but I’m sure now on there won’t be a problem in Leicester. I’m 100% confident,” he said.In a statement, Boohoo said: “Over the past eight months we have been working closely with UK enforcement bodies and it is important to note that auditors and investigators who are forensically examining suppliers in Leicester have found no evidence of modern-day slavery.“We have taken action against 64 suppliers who did not meet the group’s standards in the levels of transparency that business requires.”The company went on to claim that they have not been notified of any investigation from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, claiming that they believe they are in line with the regulations against modern slavery.Coronavirus Exposed Modern Day Slavery Trade in the UK, Says Former Tory Leader https://t.co/IIYByj0LqB— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 16, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaEconomyImmigrationLondon / EuropeBlack Lives MatterBlack Lives Matter UKFashionModern Day SlaveryModern SlaverySanctionstarrifstradeUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
701,"Sir Winston Churchill’s grandson, Sir Nicholas Soames, has joined a prominent historian for a comprehensive fisking of the case against the wartime leader advanced by left-wing academics at a Churchill College seminar.Priyamvada Gopal, Onyeka Nubia, Kehinde Andrews, and Madhusree Mukerjee had slated the British icon at the college bearing his name in a seminar titled The Racial Consequences of Mr Churchill, in which he was described as “the perfect embodiment of white supremacy” and the empire he led to victory over Hitler’s Germany branded “far worse than the Nazis.”These and other charges have now been rebutted in a Policy Exchange paper written by historian Andrew Roberts, author of Churchill: Walking with Destiny, and Zewditu Gebreyohanes, a former intern of the late conservative philosopher Sir Roger Scruton, with a foreword by Sir Nicholas Soames.Sir Nicholas, who was like his grandfather a Conservative parliamentarian until the last election, described The Racial Consequences of Mr Churchill as “a new low in the current vogue for the denigration in general of British history and of Sir Winston Churchill’s memory in particular”, something he noted is “now sadly quite common” — but not something he would have expected to see from Churchill College.“This College, the first one at Cambridge University to be named after a person living at the time of its founding, is the National and Commonwealth Memorial to Sir Winston Churchill and was to be the embodiment of his vision of how higher education can benefit society in the modern age,” Sir Nicholas recalled.“The College benefits enormously from Churchill’s name. If they traduce it, should they be able to have their cake and eat it?” he asked, suggesting that, for once, an institution named for a historical figure should be rebranded not to appease woke activists, but because it no longer deserves the association.My & Zewditu Gebreyohanes & Nick Soames' reply for Policy Exchange to the attacks on Churchill at Churchill College this month: https://t.co/1LaHP8d102 Using history & facts, we dissect, & hopefully rebut, the allegations of Churchill's detractors #Churchill #WinstonChurchill— Andrew Roberts (@aroberts_andrew) February 28, 2021In the paper proper, the claims of  Gopal, Nubia, Andrews, and Mukerjee were subject to a forensic interrogation, with some of their claims, as Sir Nicholas Soames put it, turning out to have been “idiotically sloppy”.On one occasion, for example, the anti-Churchill academics had suggested that Churchill “wasn’t even that popular at the time… he was never elected”, which Roberts and Gebreyohanes easily disproved with reference to Gallup polling showing he consistently enjoyed approval ratings of 78 to 93 per cent throughout his wartime premiership, increased his constituency majority by around 5,000 votes in the 1945 general election, and led the Conservative Party back into government in the 1951 general election.Roberts and Gebreyohanes were able to highlight similarly fundamental errors elsewhere in their paper, such as Onyeka Nubia at one point confusing Labour politicians Aneurin Bevan and Ernest Bevin, and Kehinde Andrews — Britain’s inaugural professor of “Black Studies” — making a “baffling claim that “the temperature of the earth […] rose” as a result of Europeans’ “alleged genocide” of indigenous peoples in the Americas, which appears — they said — to have no basis in reality.Churchill’s supposed culpability for the Bengal Famine, advanced by non-historian Madhusree Mukerjee without challenge, was also debunked at length, with reference to research by “scholars such as Amartya Sen, Arthur Herman and Tirthankar Roy”.“Churchill authorised the sending of over 130,000 tonnes of Iraqi and Australian grain to Bengal; by the end of 1944 a total of 1 million tonnes of grain had been sent,” Roberts and Gebreyohanes noted, highlighting Churchill’s instructions that “Every effort must be made, even by the diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes, to deal with local shortages” and the enormous pressures the British faced, with the Japanese “at the gates of India” and their submarines prowling the shipping lanes.Churchill College Hosts Anti-Churchill Talk: 'Embodiment of White Supremacy', British Empire 'Far Worse' Than Nazis https://t.co/a6eTjrqL4u— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021“It appears that the panellists were chosen deliberately to portray just one side of an argument without any opportunity to challenge their narrative,” the Policy Exchange paper concluded, after examing several other charges against the wartime premier and finding all of them wanting.“What is especially perplexing is that Churchill College, the National and Commonwealth memorial to Sir Winston Churchill, should of
all institutions in the land have organised an event of such clearly premeditated malice and character assassination,” its authors added, saying they hoped their rebuttal would help to set the record straight and finishing with one Churchill’s own famous lines: “Truth is incontrovertible.

702,"The British government is reportedly seeking to extend powers granted to police to crack down on protests even after lockdown restrictions are lifted, raising concerns about the state of freedom of speech in the country.A freedom of information request has revealed that Home Secretary Priti Patel wrote to the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), questioning how the government could continue to limit protests.In the September letter, reported by The Observer on Sunday, Patel said that while protesting is “a cornerstone of our democracy”, she inquired as to how the Home Office could prevent protests from impacting upon “the rights of others to go about their daily business”.“I would like to know… what steps the government could take to ensure the police have the right powers and capabilities to respond to protests,” she wrote to the head of HMICFRS, Sir Thomas Winsor.The letter prompted an inspectorate review into how police should deal with protests. The review will ultimately inform Ms Patel’s planned legislation, which is already seeking to limit protesters from blocking the roads around Parliament or impacting judicial hearings.John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation, has also admitted that he lobbied the Home Secretary to introduce stricter measures against peaceful protesters during the pandemic.The civil liberties pressure group Big Brother Watch said: “Police have a duty to facilitate the right to protest. It is not their job to lobby the Government to take it away.”Surveillance State: British Police Deploying Drones to Monitor Protests https://t.co/4s4K81Y2Bl— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021The campaign group Liberty has warned that the government is attempting to use the coronavirus pandemic to stifle fundamental human rights in the UK.“It’s a failure to prioritise what is the exercise of a fundamental democratic right and one that is all the more important given the government’s propensity to sideline parliament in the course of dealing with this pandemic,” said Liberty interim director Gracie Bradley.“The government is clearly intent on shielding itself from scrutiny, whether it’s parliament, freedom of information, or protest,” she added.While the government granted exceptions to political protests during the initial wave of the pandemic, in November, the home secretary instructed police to break up any protests consisting of more than two people.Since December, protests in the British capital have all but ceased, with police threatening to issue organisers of protests £10,000 fixed penalty notices for breaching the coronavirus restrictions, which have been found to be the strictest in the Western world.Policing minister Kit Malthouse denied that the impending legislation on protests had been tied to the ban on protests during the lockdown.In a statement given to the paper, Malthouse said: “Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and the government will be in the vanguard of protecting our inalienable right to express our views by nonviolent means.“But this must be carefully balanced with the rights of others to go about their business, and not seek to prevent the operation of our democracy. That is why we undertook some time ago to review the 30-year-old public order legislation, to make sure we have that delicate and important balance right.”Exclusive Video: Watch Cops Storm, Forcibly Shut Down Peaceful Anti-Lockdown Protest in London https://t.co/KHEbyz6vvB— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 27, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLaw and OrderLondon / EuropeBig Brother WatchBritish policecoronavirusfreedom of speechhome officeJohn ApterlockdownLockdown Protestslockdownsnational lockdownpriti patelprotestsRight to AssemblyRight to ProtestUK policeUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
703,"The chief prosecutor of Sweden’s National Security Case Unit has criticised the country’s terror laws, saying they could create a situation where terrorists flee to the country to escape prosecution in other nations.Prosecutor Per Lindqvist stated that Sweden could become a haven for members of groups like the Islamic State, as the country’s laws are often much less strict than other European Union member states.Lindqvist said the country needed tough laws, telling the Sveriges Radio: “It remains an urgent and almost immediate need, I would say.”“We run the risk of having individuals who come to Sweden to avoid criminal proceedings in other countries. I think that could be a concern in the future, and I think it’s a concern now,” he told the broadcaster.‘Quite Difficult to Prove’: One Year After Launch, No Charges Made Under New Swedish Counter-Terror Law https://t.co/VUlSx1igom— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 2, 2021Lindqvist’s warning comes just a day after it was revealed that not a single individual has been charged or even arrested since Sweden’s new anti-terrorism laws were put into force last year.The laws on paper allow for the prosecution of those associated with terrorist groups, but cases have been difficult to prove, as it requires evidence such as handling weapons or explosives.“How the rules have been designed makes it quite difficult to prove this crime. A sign of this, of course, is that we have still not brought any charges so far since the law was created, nor have we requested any person to be placed in custody under this new legislation,” prosecutor Lindqvist said earlier this week.Over the last several years, many Islamic State members have returned to Sweden. In 2019 there were reports that some of the returnees had begun recruiting followers in the multicultural southern city of Malmö.Another investigation into the activities of 41 returned fighters in 2019 revealed that many had gone on to commit serious crimes after returning from the Middle East, including drug crimes, extortion, money laundering, and abuse.Sweden: Serious Crimes Committed by Returned ISIS Fighters https://t.co/RATEkXYiSp— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 16, 2019Law and OrderLondon / Europeanti-terrorismIslamic StateIslamic terrorismRadical Islamic terrorismSwedenterrorism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

705,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) faced a barrage of criticism before deleting a social media video which praised coronavirus lockdowns for “quietly improving cities around the world”.In the video, the WEF said that as a result of people using less public transport and factories closing down during the lockdown, noise and air pollution fell in cities throughout the world. The video also celebrated the ability of scientists to discover earthquakes due to the low level of seismic noise on the planet as populations were locked in their homes.The WEF, which the primary body pushing Klaus Schwab’s idea of a so-called ‘Great Reset’ of the global economic order, was widely ridiculed for the post. One of these speaking out was former Brexit Party MEP, now Editorial Director of Unlocked, Martin Daubney, who was among the first to flag the video before it was taken down. Daubney later reposted the video, further exposing the WEF to criticism.Speaking to Breitbart London, Mr Daubney said: “I’m glad they tweeted this — because it has exposed them for the out-of-touch crackpots that they are. The WEF sees humanity as a blight, something to be controlled and imprisoned, in order to meet arbitrary climate change targets.“There’s just one problem, the public won’t play along with their Great Reset nonsense. All of the things the WEF want to stop: work, travel, capitalism, are the things the vast majority of humanity lives for. The WEF have exposed themselves as ridiculously out of touch with the everyday man and woman. Sheltered in their ivory towers, they treat the rest of us with absolute seething contempt.”Mr Daubney went on to say that the WEF should be kept well away from being able to “pull the levers of power in any country around the world.”“The WEF would rather we were imprisoned and carbon-neutral, and that is a grisly future that no sane human should want any part of,” he added.This is the tweet the @wef deleted, saying “lockdowns are quietly improving cities”Lockdowns have destroyed cities, lives & economies.

Lockdowns aren’t ‘quietly improving cities’ around the world. But they are an important part of the public health response to COVID-19.”Commenting on the WEF deleting the video, Mr Daubney said that the fact that the Davos-based NGO didn’t see the backlash coming “proves how divorced from reality they are. They have no understanding of the everyday workings of the general public,” who he said “just want to work, prosper and enjoy life.”“This moment has been a rude awakening for the WEF, having, at last, popped its head out of its echo chamber. Yesterday they were telling us to have our COVID-passports ready before we leave our bunkers. Now they are telling us we had better not pollute once we leave!”.Brexit’s Daubney also noted how Schwab wasn’t the only dubious character given a shot in the arm by the pandemic. The reemergence of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair during the pandemic has seen his globalist charity, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, partnering with the WEF to develop an international vaccine passport.“Tony Blair has gone from being a war criminal to pulling the strings behind the UK’s COVID passport rollout. He’s absolutely in bed with the WEF and we are increasingly seeing them as a cabal of out-of-touch millionaires who have literally no idea how ordinary people think and live,” Daubney said.'The Great Reset' is upon us.

Welcome to my city – or should I say, ‘our city’. I don’t own anything. I don’t own a car. I don’t own a house. I don’t own any appliances or any clothes,” the WEF projected.In June of last year, Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum said that the Chinese coronavirus was an opportunity for global governments to introduce a “Great Reset of capitalism“, saying that the “world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies.”Delingpole: ‘Trussst Usss!

706,"MILAN (AP) – Officials at the Pompeii archaeological site in Italy announced Saturday the discovery of an intact ceremonial chariot, one of several important discoveries made in the same area outside the park near Naples following an investigation into an illegal dig.The chariot, with its iron elements, bronze decorations and mineralized wooden remains, was found in the ruins of a settlement north of Pompeii, beyond the walls of the ancient city, parked in the portico of a stable where the remains of three horses previously were discovered.The Archaeological Park of Pompeii called the chariot “an exceptional discovery” and said “it represents a unique find – which has no parallel in Italy thus far – in an excellent state of preservation.”The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD destroyed Pompeii. The chariot was spared when the walls and roof of the structure it was in collapsed, and also survived looting by modern-day antiquities thieves, who had dug tunnels through to the site, grazing but not damaging the four-wheeled cart, according to park officials.The chariot was found on the grounds of what is one of the most significant ancient villas in the area around Vesuvius, with a panoramic view of the Mediterranean Sea. on the outskirts of the ancient Roman city.Archaeologists last year found in the same area on the outskirts of Pompeii, Civita Giulian, the skeletal remains of what are believed to have been a wealthy man and his male slave, attempting to escape death.The chariot’s first iron element emerged on Jan. 7 from the blanket of volcanic material filling the two-story portico. Archaeologists believe the cart was used for festivities and parades, perhaps also to carry brides to their new homes.While chariots for daily life or the transport of agricultural products have been previously found at Pompeii, officials said the new find is the first ceremonial chariot unearthed in its entirety.The villa was discovered after police came across the illegal tunnels in 2017, officials said. Two people who live in the houses atop the site are currently on trial for allegedly digging more than 80 meters of tunnels at the site.London / EuropeArchaeologyChariotItalyPompeii.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
707,"Activists aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza are said to have dropped several large boulders into the English channel in an effort to stop bottom-trawling fishing in a protected area favoured by French boats.The ecological activist group tossed 18 boulders overboard in the channel in order to create a barrier and prevent trawling by fishermen who use a bottom-trawling method to scrape the seabed, which Greenpeace has likened to taking a bulldozer to a national park. According to reports, the area impacted is one used by French ships.The group announced the formation of the “boulder barrier” on Twitter on Friday, and later released a full statement on their website saying, “This barrier will stop destructive fishing in what’s supposed to be a protected part of the ocean. But we’re also here to expose the government’s failure to look after its so-called Marine Protected Areas all around the UK.”“These boulders will deter destructive industrial ‘bottom trawlers’ from fishing in that area, because they risk damaging their fishing gear if it comes into contact with the boulders,” the group said and stated that they took safety precautions and informed local authorities as to the location of the boulders.This is the 2nd boulder barrier we’ve built.

Whatever differences we may have with the Government over the implementation of its policies on marine protected areas, we need to know that we are not moving into an era where policy is dictated by media-savvy bullies,” the NFFO stated.Report: Britain 'Cannot' Stop EU Supertrawlers Ravaging British Waters https://t.co/TZDm1yjRqY— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 11, 2021Earlier this year it was revealed that European Union member-state “super-trawlers” were still operating in British waters despite Brexit and despite comments from Prime Minister Boris Johnson that indicated the practice would end.Thea Taylor, co-lead of the Brighton Dolphin Project, noted the effect of the super trawlers in the channel last year saying, “Between them, these supertrawlers have not only caught masses of their target fish species but tonnes of fish and marine life that they do not want, including marine mammals. These are usually ground down for animal feed or thrown back dead as bycatch.”“We see a surge in dead dolphins on Sussex beaches when supertrawlers are here or during the weeks after,” Taylor added.EU Supertrawlers Ravage British Waters Ahead of Brexit, Kill Dolphins, Porpoises, Seals https://t.co/89Vnn06XZm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 13, 2020EnvironmentLondon / EuropeBrexitenvironmentalismEuropean UnionfishingFranceGreenpeaceSupertrawlersUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
708,"Despite election-time promises, in the near-11 years since coming to power the UK Conservative party has increased taxes more often than it cut them and the tax burden is on the verge of hitting a 70-year-high.The Conservative party, said to be the most successful political party on earth for its historic ability to reliably win elections, came to power in May 2010. Although its first parliament was in coalition with the centrist-globalist Liberal Democrats, since then it has governed alone, and despite a free hand to help the British people in line with its traditional principles — low tax, less interference, pro-freedom — taxes have instead risen.🚨 RESEARCHAhead of the budget on Wednesday, TPA research has identified 1,034 tax rises under Conservative prime ministers since 2010. 📈Of the 1,651 tax changes in the last decade, 63 per cent were tax hikes. ⬆️Find out more. 👇https://t.co/2aNd6ow2my pic.twitter.com/K7LZJBWN9a— TaxPayers' Alliance (@the_tpa) February 28, 2021Now the scale of these rises has been thrown into sharp relief by the public’s advocate think tank the Tax Payers’ Alliance, which catalogued every tax change since May 2010. Changes to tax levels took place a remarkable 1,651 times in that period but remarkably considering Conservative promises, 1,034 — or 63 per cent — of those were actually rises.In all tax has gone up, on average, once every three days for over a decade, the Daily Telegraph calculates.Underlining the disconnect between Conservative rhetoric and Conservative delivery, the TPA noted:The 2019 Conservative manifesto promised that “Conservatives want to give you freedom – low taxes, opportunity, the chance to realise your dreams.” Yet under the current Conservative prime minister, the sustained tax burden will reach a 70 year high.“The sustained tax burden is now the highest it’s been since the country was recovering from the Second World War 70 years ago, and any tax rises in the next Budget will put that figure even higher."" https://t.co/re0wyyLGPy— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 1, 2021While the statistics underline a long term failure by the Conservative party to use its historic period in office to advance the interests of its own voters, the TPA’s research does indicate that while the tax burden is now at a 70-year-high, the question of whether a thaw could be on the horizon is open.Perhaps unsurprisingly given the way the Liberal Democrat coalition pulled the Conservatives to the left during their time in coalition, David Cameron was the most tax-happy Prime Minister of the Conservative decade, he put taxes up on average 110 times a year for a total of 663 rises.His luckless successor Theresa May wasn’t much better, putting taxes up around 100 times a year. But present Prime Minister Boris Johnson — perhaps unsurprisingly, given over half of his leadership has now been consumed with the coronavirus lockdown — has changed taxes far less, putting tolls up just 50 times a year.According to the TPA’s research, Johnson’s administration has actually cut taxes once more often than it has put taxes up so far — an unmatched achievement.Punitive Green Policies: UK’s ‘Conservative’ Govt to Tax Meat and Cheese https://t.co/LTiBEiMp5Q— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2021Yet that line of optimism on Johnson’s tax behaviour so far — and most of it during the coronavirus pandemic when the government-imposed lockdown’s economic collapse made any sort of tax rise all but impossible — is very obviously tempered by what is expected in the new budget expected this coming week. The government’s response to coronavirus has been marked by near-unprecedented levels of government spending, with wartime-like leaps in public borrowing.Although the government could choose to give the economy the best chance possible of roaring back into life post-lockdown by minimising the burden on individuals and businesses, reports on Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s likely actions paint a bleak picture.The Sunday Times reports that Sunak was already laying the ground for “stealth” tax rises to be announced in his budget this week, forecasting that one measure coming forward would be freezing the levels at which the income tax bands apply. This is a “stealth” rise because while the figures won’t actually change immediately, they will be prevented from moving with inflation in coming years, meaning more and more people will be drawn into higher tax brackets over the coming years.The paper states this means 1.6 million people would be pushed into a higher rate tax bracket before the 2024 general election. Indicating the government doesn’t intend to balance the budget with this and other hikes, the paper reported Sunak would “sweeten” this pitter pill with tens of billions in new spending.UK Knife Crime Hits Record High Under Tories, as Over 50K Offences Logged in One Year https://t.co/35Oz8NxqIZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 27, 2021As already noted, taxes are already at a historic high in Britain, after years of rises. Breitbart London reported earlier this month on the then-comments of Taxpayer’s Alliance chief executive John O’Connell, who said of the state of the nation: “The sustained tax burden is now the highest it’s been since the country was recovering from the Second World War 70 years ago, and any tax rises in the next Budget will put that figure even higher.“In these difficult times, the Chancellor should give hard-pressed families and businesses a respite from taxes, offer a rescue to struggling sectors and try to revive the economy.”High levels of tax are not the only area in which the Conservatives look worryingly like they may have squandered a good decade in power. Another area of key branding for the Tories has long been the perception of being the party of law and order, yet UK knife crime has been rising for most of the time the Conservatives have been in power and recently hit a historic high.Soaring Taxes on Their Way to Pay for Britain's Mammoth Corona Debt https://t.co/kepYbCbvwg— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 23, 2021EconomyLondon / EuropeBoris JohnsonbudgetcoronavirusDavid CameronGeorge OsborneIncome taxlockdownRishi SunakTaxPayers' AllianceTheresa May.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Her appointment came through last month when the Biden administration cleared the way for her selection at the trade body, whose rules require consensus.The WTO, which works to craft accords that can ensure smooth international trade, is facing headwinds such as rising protectionism. Its dispute settlement system has been blocked because the United States has almost singlehandedly prevented appointments to its Appellate Body – a rough equivalent to an appeals court.Okonjo-Iweala said last month that “wide-ranging reforms” are needed at the WTO, and that her first priority would be to address the economic and health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as by working to lift export restrictions on supplies and vaccines to get them distributed to countries in need.EconomyLondon / EuropePoliticsgenevaNgozi Okonjo-IwealaSwitzerlandworld trade organization.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

715,"BERLIN (AP) – Companies that sell refrigerators, washers, hairdryers or TVs in the European Union will need to ensure those appliances can be repaired for up to 10 years, to help reduce the vast mountain of electrical waste that piles up each year on the continent.The “right to repair,” as it is sometimes called, comes into force across the 27-nation bloc Monday. It is part of a broader effort to cut the environmental footprint of manufactured goods by making them more durable and energy efficient.“This is a really big step in the right direction” said Daniel Affelt of the environmental group BUND-Berlin, which runs several “repair cafes” where people can bring in their broken appliances and get help fixing them up again.Modern appliances are often glued or riveted together, he said. “If you need specialist tools or have to break open the device, then you can´t repair it.”Lack of spare parts is another problem, campaigners say. Sometimes a single broken tooth on a tiny plastic sprocket can throw a proverbial wrench in the works.“People want to repair their appliances,” Affelt said. “When you tell them that there are no spare parts for a device that´s only a couple of years old then they are obviously really frustrated by that.”Under the new EU rules, manufacturers will have to ensure parts are available for up to a decade, though some will only be provided to professional repair companies to ensure they are installed correctly.New devices will also have to come with repair manuals and be made in such a way that they can be dismantled using conventional tools when they really can’t be fixed anymore, to improve recycling.Each year, Europeans produce more than 16 kilograms (35 pounds) of electrical waste per person. About half of that junk is due to broken household appliances, and the EU recycles only about 40% of it, leaving behind huge amounts of potentially hazardous material.German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said that in a next step, manufacturers should have to state how long a product is expected to work for and repair it if it breaks down earlier. This would encourage companies to build more durable products, she said.“In the repair cafes we see a lot of devices that broke shortly after the warranty expired,” said Affelt – a phenomenon that has prompted some environmentalists to accuse manufacturers of designing their devices with planned obsolescence.Knowing an appliance will really last for a decade might prompt consumers to choose products that are more durable or can be easily fixed, he said.“For the vast majority of devices, repair is the right choice,” said Affelt, adding that the exception might be old, inefficient refrigerators that can contain powerful greenhouse gases which fuel climate change.In a next step, environmentalists and consumer rights groups want the “right to repair” expanded to include smartphones, laptops and other small electrical devices.Responding to growing demand, Apple last year announced it would start providing training and spare parts to certified independent repair stores fixing Mac computers, not just iPhones.Right to repair bills have been introduced in several U.S. state legislatures, attracting bipartisan support, though as yet there is no nationwide measure in force.Sweden has gone further than most of the EU, making repairs and spare parts subject to lower value-added tax.The bloc’s ecological design directive – of which the right to repair requirement is a part – will also revise existing energy labels that describe how much electricity washers and other household devices consume. The new seven-step scale from A to G will be complemented by a QR code that provides consumers with further information, such as how loud the devices are.EconomyLondon / EuropeEuropean Union.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

More than 100 people were arrested during that stretch.The flare-up of violence on Saturday came after a few nights of tense calm.Spain´s left-wing government has pledged to eliminate prison terms for offenses involving freedom of speech, but so far that has done little to quell the unrest.Protesters walk past a burning ATM machine during a demonstration for various social issues under the slogan “Fight, Create Popular Power” including the recent arrest of Spanish rapper Pablo Hasel in Barcelona on February 27, 2021.

We can only apologise for any offence or insult to anyone in our community that this may have caused.”The general secretary of the Free Speech Union, Toby Young, lamented that the Art Society and the History in Politics Society — which is co-organising the competition — are bowing down to “woke bullies”.“They’ve allowed themselves to be bullied by a small minority of political activists,” he declared.“Far from being sensitive to the feelings of the local community in Durham, these student societies have thumbed their noses at all those local people who voted Conservative at the last Election,” Young added.A spokesman for the Art and History in Politics societies responded: “After some of the history of certain names on the list was drawn to our attention, we decided amongst ourselves to remove them.”Sculpture of Margaret Thatcher’s Severed Head on a Pike Displayed in Prime Minister’s Hometown https://t.co/S9qPdfIXqG— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 23, 2021Meanwhile, Oxford University has been accused of trying to take down the legacy of British mining magnate and politician Cecil Rhodes, whose statue has long been a target of leftist for his connections to the British Empire and his antiquated views on race.Academics at the university will vote to rename the Rhodes Professor of Race Relations, which was established in the 1950s. The move comes amidst a five-year student campaign dubbed “Rhodes Must Fall“, which is likely to have succeeded in forcing the eventual removal of his statue.Aside from attempting to remove Rhodes’ name from the professorship, Oxford will also reportedly remove the remit of the office from “giving instruction in interracial relations to giving instruction in African Studies”, The Telegraph reported.The founder of the campaign Save Our Statues, Robert Poll, told the paper: “This shows how the culture war is being fought on many fronts, with statues just the most obvious, physical one.“The other fronts are quieter and have fewer protections, so what we are seeing is Rhodes falling by the back door.“It’s ironic that this comes in the same month as the Wykeham Professorship has been renamed after a Chinese state-funded company. The university’s morality is rather less consistent than its hypocrisy.”A spokesman for Oxford University said: “The University has recommended that the name of the Chair should change to Professor of African Studies as more appropriate to the post’s present-day academic purpose.“The move reflects this post’s central role in building the University’s African Studies Centre.”Black Lives Matter disorder spread across the Atlantic with remarkable speed in 2020 after the death of George Floyd in the United States, with statues torn down or vandalized across the country and London plunged into violent disorder, despite lockdowns. https://t.co/WrQ4h1woVS— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 5, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaEducationLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBlack Lives Matter UKBritish HistoryBritish universitiescecil rhodesdiversityDurham UniversityMargaret ThatcherMulticulturalismOxford UniversityRhodes Must FallSave Our StatuesToby YoungUK educationUnited KingdomWoke Culture.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
719,"London Mayoral candidate and lockdown sceptic Piers Corbyn was arrested by London police for campaigning against the draconian lockdown measures on Saturday.The Metropolitan Police arrested the brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Piers Corbyn, for supposedly breaching the national lockdown restrictions.Corbyn, 73, has been arrested at least five times since the beginning of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, according to the Daily Mail.Last month, the controversial campaigner was arrested for publishing leaflets that compared the UK’s coronavirus vaccine rollout to the Auschwitz concentration camp run by the Nazis in German-occupied Poland.“The statement that vaccines are the path to freedom is false, as indeed was the Nazi claim that work is the path to freedom,” he told Sky News, adding: “It’s not offensive. What happened in the Holocaust was horrible and offensive — that isn’t really what this question is about.”In January, the British meteorologist and physicist — who was hitherto known for his outspoken scepticism of man-made climate change — announced his intentions to run against incumbent Mayor Sadiq Khan on the platform of ending lockdowns.Greg Hands, the Conservative MP and chairman of the mayoral campaign for Tory Shaun Bailey, described Mr Corbyn’s Saturday rally as “totally irresponsible”.“Wasting police time [and] resources so he can create a publicity stunt for his conspiracy, anti-vax, COVID-denying campaign to be Mayor of London,” Hands wrote on social media.Hands went on to publish a statement from the Hammersmith and Fulham police force, which read: “This afternoon anti lockdown protesters and musicians gathered in Bishops Park, SW6 around 1300 hours. Local officers engaged with the organisers, however, they refused to acknowledge our directions and continued to set up their instruments which gathered a significant crowd.“Further units were requested before the organiser of the event was arrested. In total, 5 persons were arrested for their part in today’s protest.

This policy has been adopted by the local government in Wales, leading to police coming to the home of Neil McEvoy MS, who is challenging First Minister Mark Drakeford for his seat.“When the police are banging on politicians’ doors late in the evening to ‘caution’ them against delivering election leaflets you know things have gone too far.

720,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for the expansion of postal voting in the upcoming local elections, claiming that the “disproportionate” effect of the Chinese coronavirus on ethnic minorities and the elderly will reduce voter turnout.Mr Khan has been serving as the unelected Mayor of London for nearly a whole extra year after the regular elections were cancelled in March of 2020 during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.In a letter to Constitution Minister Chloe Smith, Khan demanded that the government fund the distribution of postal voting forms to every household in the areas having elections this May.“I am still concerned at the potential for low voter turnout, given the circumstances under which the elections will be held,” the mayor wrote, per The Independent.“We know that the virus disproportionately affects Bame people, as well as older and vulnerable people, and we must ensure that they are similarly not disproportionately affected when it comes to being able to cast their vote.“I welcome the government’s move to make it easier to vote by proxy and the publication of the Election Delivery Plan, but I urge you to go further.“I am therefore calling on you to launch a widespread public awareness campaign on postal vote registration [and] make further funding available to local authorities to send postal vote registration forms to every household.”Mr Khan claimed that the issue of postal voting is not a “party political issue” but is rather about maximising “participation in our democracy”.Sadiq Khan Demands Minorities Get Preferential Access to Coronavirus Vaccines https://t.co/uKn6Pp9YbN— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 19, 2020The Conservative government under Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced this month that it would be introducing a voter ID requirement in elections starting from 2023.The Electoral Integrity Bill will also reportedly introduce measures to prevent abuse of the postal and proxy voting systems. However, the government has yet to explain what rules will be set in place to prevent abuse.Mail-in voting was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2001 under former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair and has since been dogged by instances of voter fraud.In 2005, for example, Labour councillors Shafaq Ahmed, Shah Jahan, Ayaz Khan, Mohammed Islam, Muhammed Afzal, and Mohammed Kazi were all found guilty of electoral fraud after it was found that they had set up a  “vote-forging factory” in Birmingham, bolstering their election changes with fake postal ballots.In another notable example, the supporters of Britain’s first directly-elected Muslim mayor, Luftur Rahman, were accused of “buying votes with public money, and committing postal vote fraud on an industrial scale.”A forensic handwriting expert found that “one quarter” of sampled postal ballots “appeared, in each case, to be written in the same ink”.Other examples of voter fraud in the postal system have also been recorded in Tower Hamlets and Bradford.The London Mayor election will be held on May 6th.Election Fraud: Is Britain Finally Waking Up To The Disaster Of Multiculturalism? https://t.co/f4FP0HXxpT pic.twitter.com/O30U1TltBy— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 12, 2016Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticselectoral fraudlocal electionsLondonlondon mayorlondon mayoral electionsmail-in votingPostal votespostal votingsadiq khanvoter fraud.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
721,"PARIS (AP) – The verdict is expected on Monday in a landmark corruption and influence-peddling trial that has put French former President Nicolas Sarkozy at risk of a prison sentence if he is convicted.Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, firmly denied all the allegations against him during the 10-day trial that took place at the end of last year.The 66-year-old politician is suspected of having tried to illegally obtain information from a senior magistrate in 2014 about a legal action in which he was involved.This is the first time in France´s modern history that a former president has gone on trial for corruption. Sarkozy´s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money and given a two-year suspended prison sentence for actions during his time as Paris mayor.Sarkozy Slams ‘Medieval Behaviour’, Says Immigrants Should ‘Live Like The French’ https://t.co/OikfUQkrtt pic.twitter.com/S363d7dogy— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 20, 2016Sarkozy´s co-defendants – his lawyer and longtime friend Thierry Herzog, 65, and now-retired magistrate Gilbert Azibert, 74 – also deny wrongdoing.Prosecutors have requested two years of prison and a two-year suspended sentence for all three defendants over what they said was a “corruption pact.”“No pact has ever existed,” Sarkozy told the court. “Neither in my head, nor in reality.”“I want to be cleared of that infamy,” he added.The trial focused on phone conversations that took place in February 2014.At the time, investigative judges had launched an inquiry into the financing of the 2007 presidential campaign. During the investigation they incidentally discovered that Sarkozy and Herzog were communicating via secret mobile phones registered to the alias “Paul Bismuth.”Conversations wiretapped on these phones led prosecutors to suspect Sarkozy and Herzog of promising Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about another legal case, known by the name of France´s richest woman, L´Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.Sarkozy: ‘We Didn’t Fight the Nazis for Jews to Flee Europe Seven Decades On’ https://t.co/a08GgIFnGL pic.twitter.com/bdaUZ4pvDf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 11, 2016In one of these phone calls with Herzog, Sarkozy said of Azibert : “I´ll make him move up … I´ll help him.”In another, Herzog reminded Sarkozy to “say a word” for Azibert during a trip to Monaco.Legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the Bettencourt case. Azibert never got the Monaco job.Prosecutors have concluded, however, that the “clearly stated promise” constitutes in itself a corruption offense under French law, even if the promise wasn’t fulfilled.Sarkozy vigorously denies any malicious intention.He told the court that his political life was all about “giving (people) a little help. That all it is, a little help.”“I was 100 billion miles away from thinking we were doing something we did not have the right to do,” he said.Sarkozy said he did not get confidential information from Azibert.Prosecutors believe Sarkozy was at some point informed that the secret phones were being wiretapped and that it is the reason why he did not ultimately help Azibert get the job.The confidentiality of communications between a lawyer and his client has been a major point of contention in the trial.Sarkozy: French Identity Being Lost https://t.co/LR99RaOoG3 pic.twitter.com/9vNqoKhOkp— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 9, 2016“You have in front of you a man of whom more that 3,700 private conversations have been wiretapped… What did I do to deserve that?” Sarkozy said.Sarkozy´s defense lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont, argued the whole case was based on “small talk” between a lawyer and his client.“You don´t have the beginning of a piece of evidence, not the slightness witness account, the slightness declaration,” she told the court.Sarkozy withdrew from active politics after failing to be chosen as his conservative party´s presidential candidate for France´s 2017 election, won by Emmanuel Macron.He remains very popular amid right-wing voters, however, and plays a major role behind the scenes, including through maintaining a relationship with Macron, whom he is said to advise on certain topics. His memoirs published this summer, “The Time of Storms,” was a bestseller for weeks.Sarkozy will face another trial later this month along with 13 other people on charges of illegal financing of his 2012 presidential campaign.His conservative party is suspected of having spent 42.8 million euros ($50.7 million), almost twice the maximum authorized, to finance the campaign, which ended in victory for Socialist rival Francois Hollande.In another investigation opened in 2013, Sarkozy is accused of having taken millions from then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi to illegally finance his 2007 campaign.He was handed preliminary charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of stolen assets from Libya and criminal association.

724,"European elites that mourn the loss of Britain — and the nation’s significant financial contributions — from the bloc have themselves to blame, Hungarian leader Viktor Orban has said in a wide-ranging interview with the German press.While the British people voted to leave the European Union, it was the Eurocrats in Brussels steering the project whose choices had left the British feeling they had no choice but to go their own way, Orban said. Responding to a question by a journalist from German magazine FOCUS, asking him to elaborate on historic comments he made saying that Brexit could have been avoided, the Hungarian Prime Minister was clear that while the European Union could probably get away with pushing around less powerful nations, a leading state like the UK would inevitably decide to do something about it.EU’s Juncker Rules out Brexit, Says No ‘Plan B’ https://t.co/TPA2ZQJQHE pic.twitter.com/SOgApLK1Bu— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2016“You can’t behave like that with one of the world’s largest economies, a nuclear power and a member of the Security Council”, Prime Minister Orban said. Given the United Kingdom did vote to leave the European Union in 2016 and finally completed its withdrawal in 2021, taking with it the £11 billion net the country sent to Brussels annually, the Hungarian leader asked sardonically of Brussels: “Was it worth it?”One of the examples cited by Orban was when the European Union served its own narrow ends rather than trying to build bridges with London was the selection of Jean Claude-Juncker as European Commissioner in 2014. This move was in the face of extremely strong protests from London, which partnered with Budapest to oppose the move.This was more than a simple clash of personalities — then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron knew Juncker was a strongly pro-Eurofederalism candidate, a direction for Europe that was very unpopular among British voters. He also feared — rightly — Juncker would block positive reform of the bloc during a time where Cameron needed the EU to look as good as possible to the British people.Both suspicions came to pass. Indeed, David Cameron’s last-ditch attempt to get serious reform of the UK’s relationship with the EU in 2016 to take back to the British people as evidence they could safely vote to stay in the bloc in that year’s referendum was broadly interpreted to have been a failure. The EU — led by Juncker — showed at that time it both was not interested in meaningful change, and clearly believed the British would not vote to leave anyway.While Hungary believed the EU was disadvantaged by Britain leaving the bloc — Hungary is a beneficiary of European cash, which the UK helped pay for, the UK is a net contributor to global security, and London was a top freedom of movement destination — the Hungarian government has always taken the view that it was a matter for the British alone, and that it would be an advantage for the British to be free. Nevertheless, although the Hungarian government isn’t agitating to leave the EU, it wants to see the bloc move in the destination once envisioned by Britain’s leadership — less centralised, controlling, and bureaucratic.Juncker: More Federalism Will Overcome Populist Nationalism https://t.co/KVH41VBhtl pic.twitter.com/2btuXGolKD— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 14, 2016Asked about the European Union’s — failed — approach to acquiring coronavirus vaccines by FOCUS, Mr Orban made clear that the centralised approach had failed. While the journalist asked: “Brussels has sent the following message: ‘Look, we’re stronger together than as individual Member States.’ In other words, Europe functions as a united, centralised state. Are you convinced by this strategy?”, the Hungarian Prime Minister replied:No. The value of any strategy lies in how successful it is. In those areas in which joint action brings about success, we must take joint action; wherever a national path brings about success, that is the one which must be pursued. We’ve sought to do something together that we could have managed more successfully on an individual basis – take a look at the examples of Britain or Serbia.Orban was also quizzed more broadly on Europe’s economic development. There, he made clear again that Europe’s centralising mission — which beyond a centralized currency and bank, is now drifting towards central Brussels-set budgets as well — was failing and leaving a two-speed Europe. This was down to a differential in culture, Orban explained, retreading his oft-repeated refrain that central Europe’s occupation by Soviet communism in living memory inoculated voters in those countries against the seduction of socialism in a way that Western Europe could not understand.This, the Hungarian leader said, left Western Europe vulnerable. He told FOCUS:Here, in Central Europe, things are going well. All our economic indicators are excellent, and our national budget is as it should be. Our work-oriented policies have helped us towards almost reaching full employment, and we’re also making good progress in the sphere of digitalisation. In the West there are too many economic policies reminiscent of socialism, with tax increases, complicated regulations, and measures disadvantaging capital and enterprise. The EU should do far more to promote improved competitiveness; but regrettably its share of global economic production is declining, and we find this alarming.As Breitbart London already reported, Mr Orban did not limit his condemnation of the EU to these matters. His most searing criticism was withheld for Brussels’ handling of the Europe Migrant Crisis, which he said had turned the Mediterranean sea into a cemetery of migrant bodies — people who didn’t have to die but who were lured into great danger by callous people smugglers trading off Europe’s weakness.Read more at Breitbart London. Orban: EU’s Permissive Stance on Migration Has ‘Turned the Mediterranean Into a Cemetery’ https://t.co/vkCuEfZNee— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 25, 2021 London / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrusselscoronavirusDavid CameronEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionHungaryjean-claude junckerUnited KingdomViktor Orbán.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
725,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage accused the British establishment of prioritising money over protecting the country from the “neo-colonialist” Chinese Communist Party after the revelation that UK schools were being bought up by the Asian nation.Mr Farage said that the limited attention placed communist-linked businesses buying up British independent schools was a result of elites in the country — including those in the civil service, the government, and in business — being effectively bought by the communist regime which he described as “neo-colonialist” bent on “global domination”.In a televised debate on Turkish public broadcaster TRT World, Farage said that it was down to “money, money, money,” adding: “you only have to look, for example, at Huawei… look at the people that have served on the advisory board since 2014, and what you’ll find are former big global businessmen, you’ll find former senior civil servants former political figures.”Some of the figures who have been a part of the advisory board for Chinese telecom Huawei — which has been accused of being effectively state-owned — include former CEO of British Petroleum (BP) Lord John Browne, prominent former civil servant Sir Andrew Cahn, and former chancellor of the University of Southampton, Dame Helen Alexander.The former head of the BT Group (formerly British Telecom) Sir Michael Rake stepped down from the Huawei board earlier this month.Mr Farage also pointed to former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron, who is currently heading up a Chinese investment scheme seeking to raise over £700 million in investments from the communist nation. The investment plan, dubbed the UK-China Fund, was founded by prominent Conservative Party donor Lord Peter Gummer.Mr Cameron is not the only former Prime Minister to have connections to the CCP, as a 2015 investigation found that former Labour PM Tony Blair served as a liaison between Abu Dhabi and the “highest levels of the Communist Party and state-run corporations” in the Xinjiang region of China, which is reportedly interning millions of Uyghurs in concentration camps.Blair was also found to have received £237,000 in compensation for a speech given in the Chinese industrial city of Dongguan in 2007, more than his yearly salary when he served as Prime Minister.“If you sell your soul for money to a regime that has no respect for human rights, democracy, freedom of speech then I think you deserve what’s coming to you,” Farage said.‘Fervent Sinophile’ Boris Johnson Pushes for China Trade Deal, Despite Genocide Objections https://t.co/zyCogH355C— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 22, 2021Mr Farage appeared on the programme to discuss the revelation that at least 17 independently owned schools in the UK have been acquired by Chinese investors with close ties to the ruling Communist Party.Roger Sinnett, the headmaster of one of the schools to have received Chinese financing, St Bees in Cumbria, claimed that Chinese propaganda will not be taught at the school, pronouncing that the partnership will introduce a “fusion education” of the “best” of Chinese and British education.Sinnett defended the acquisitions by saying that “nobody wants to defend the Communist Party, what we want to do is educate our children for a global future and a global future involves China,” adding that “the number of schools under communist control in England may be countable on one hand.”Mr Farage shot back by questioning “so what?”, noting that “disease starts with a couple of cells that go wrong so I don’t know how many hundreds they’re going to buy in the next few years,” explaining that the Chinese coronavirus has already forced many independently run schools out of business and therefore are ripe to be bought by Chinese investors.“I would not send my child to a school that was under Chinese control because I wouldn’t trust whatever the safeguards are I wouldn’t trust the fact they weren’t going to be propagandized,” Farge declared.Aside from the 17 British schools identified to have received financing from CCP-linked billionaires, there are currently 29 Confucius Institutes on British university campuses, and an additional 148 Confucius classrooms on schools throughout the country.A 2019 report from the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee found that the Chinese propaganda outfits attempt to silence discussion on British campuses about so-called ‘sensitive’ issues for the CCP, such as Taiwan, Tibet, and the Tiananmen Square Massacre.Over a dozen British universities are reportedly under investigation by security services over their relationships with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which may have violated national security and human rights laws.  https://t.co/JPASmB4Fvn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaAsiaEducationLondon / EuropeCCPChinaChinese Communist PartyCommunist propagandaDavid CameronElitesglobalismglobalist elitesHuaweiNigel FarageTony BlairUK educationUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Turkish port authorities, however, refused to let them disembark, reportedly due to suspicions about their health.After a second failed attempt to unload the cattle in Libya, the boat returned to Cartagena, where Spanish authorities ordered it to dock on Thursday.After an official inspection by government veterinarians, Spain´s minister of agriculture said animals were to be sacrificed. Veterinarians judged them to be both unfit either for transport to another country of for their return to Spain.The ministry said the cattle originally left Spain with the proper health authorizations.Animal rights groups have denounced the slaughter of the livestock.“This is yet another wake-up call to urgently end live export,” the Eurogroup for Animals said.London / EuropeagriculturecattleEuropean UnionfarmingFoodLive ExportSpainTurkey.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
728,"BERLIN (AP) – Pollina Dinner returned to school in Berlin for the first time this week after two months of lockdown. The 9-year-old third-grader was thrilled to see her classmates and teachers again but frets about the coronavirus pandemic’s effect on her life.“I’m not afraid of the coronavirus, I’m afraid that everything will continue like this – that my school will close again, I won’t be able to see my friends, and that I can’t go to the movies with my family,” the girl said, fingering her blue medical mask and sighing deeply. “And wearing this mask is even worse than all the shops being closed.”Psychiatrists, psychologists and pediatricians in Germany have voiced growing alarm that school closings, social restrictions and other precautions are magnifying the fear, disruption and stress of the pandemic among Germany´s 13.7 million children and teenagers, raising the prospect of a future mental health crisis.“We don´t have any long-term studies yet, but there´s lots of anecdotal evidence of a crisis-driven rise in hospitalizations and overflowing psychologists´ practices,” Julia Asbrand, a professor of child and youth psychology at Berlin´s Humboldt University, told The Associated Press.Amid Rise in Child Self-Harm, Suicidality, Alcohol Deaths Boris Appoints ‘Mental Health Ambassador’ https://t.co/YKKQzx86sf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 4, 2021A recent survey by the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf found that about one child in three is suffering from pandemic-related anxiety or depression or is exhibiting psychosomatic symptoms like headaches or stomach aches. Children from poorer and immigrant families are disproportionally affected, according to the survey.Pollina, who immigrated from Russia with her family in 2019, worries about forgetting much of her German since she only speaks Russian at home. She’s one of 150 youngsters from underprivileged families who, before the pandemic. regularly spent time after school at a youth support program on the eastern outskirts of the German capital.Arche – Ark in English – is based in Berlin’s Hellersdorf district, a neighborhood of drab concrete buildings constructed during the former Communist regime of East Germany. Some children are still allowed to come in person, but only once every two weeks. The rest of the time, the social workers and educators try to stay in touch through video chats while helping their young clients with remote learning.“Many have completely withdrawn and don´t want to get out of their rooms anymore. They´ve gained a lot of weight, are playing online games nonstop and don´t have any more structure in their everyday lives,” Arche founder Bernd Siggelkow said.The second major lockdown in Germany started before Christmas. Students in grades 1-3 were allowed to return to classrooms this week with reduced class sizes and limited lessons. The government hopes to ease further restrictions in coming weeks and has said that the re-opening of all schools is a top priority.However, there’s concern the country is slipping into a third wave of infections due to more contagious variants of the virus. Virologists have repeatedly said it is still unclear to what extent the virus spreads from children attending school into homes and communities. More than 2 million people have contracted the virus in Germany and almost 70,000 have died of COVID-19, although only 10 under the age of 20, according to the country’s disease control center.Children to be Tested for Corona Twice a Week After Returning to UK Schools https://t.co/ktWtpfsmAz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2021Even though children are not at as much risk of severe COVID-19 complications as older adults, they may be more vulnerable to the collateral mental health effects of the pandemic, according to experts.An analysis by German health insurer DAK regarding youth psychological issues confirms the first-person observations of the staff at Arche.The evaluation, which was obtained by German news agency dpa, showed that the number of children and teenagers hospitalized for psychiatric treatment in Berlin almost doubled during the first half of 2020, when schools were closed for over two months during the country’s first lockdown, compared with first six months of 2019.The statistic underscores the psychological strain the pandemic is putting on young people but does not illustrate the scope of the problem, Christoph Correll, the director of child and youth psychiatry at Berlin´s Charite hospital, told dpa.“Hospitalizations are the tip of the iceberg,” he said.Teenagers, especially girls, are more prone to eating disorders and self-harming, and many children’s psychological problems are going undetected while parents are overwhelmed and teachers, social workers and pediatricians don´t have regular contact with students, clients and patients, experts warn.Psychology professor Asbrand worries that the mental health of children and teenagers has not gotten enough attention during the pandemic. Together with other professionals in the field, she wrote an open letter to the government this month to push for youth needs to get better addressed in the ongoing health crisis and prioritized when society reopens.An immediate action government authorities could take to help mitigate possible problems would be to allow groups to gather for school and youth sports, in line with hygiene and distancing precautions.“We all don’t know yet how this is going to develop long-term, but we must focus on youth mental health now,” she said.While attending Arche this week for help with homework assigned online, 16-year-old Robin Reyer said not being able to hang out with friends has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic restrictions.“I want to celebrate birthdays again, go out and play soccer with my friends in the park or meet them at Burger King,” he said while taking a break outside in the spring sun.“Now, I’m only allowed to meet one friend at most,” he said. “That really sucks.”HealthLondon / EuropecoronavirusEuropean UnionGermanylockdown.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

730,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
731,"Turkey has begun to rename the Aegean sea as the “Sea of Isles” as part of it’s expansionist “Blue Homeland” plan, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan using the term in a recent conference.The Turkish term “Adalar Denizi” or “Sea of the Isles”  is used as part of the Blue homeland ideology as, according to former chief of the General Staff of the Turkish Naval Forces, Cihat Yaycı, it negates any mention of Greece.Yaycı, who is one of the main theorists behind the Blue Homeland idea, claimed that the word Aegean has a Greek root and should not be used by Turkey when referring to the sea, which has also been referred to as the Northern Mediterranean by Jaiji in the past, Proto Thema reports.According to the newspaper, Yaycı has argued that the Aegean islands located near Turkey belong to the Turkish continental shelf, and used the example of the recent earthquake that rocked the island of Samos and noted that the Greek mainland was unaffected by the earthquake, while the Turkish port city of Izmir had also been affected by it and suffered serious damage.Turkish Official Claims Eastern Mediterranean Part of Turkey’s ‘Blue Homeland’ https://t.co/ayUnM6AYBD— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 15, 2021Earlier this year, Yaycı stated that the Turkish government of President Erdogan should not talk with Greece over disputes in the Aegean and claimed that Greece had no jurisdiction. He added that any talks could threaten the Blue Homeland doctrine as well.In January, Turkish government communications director Fahrettin Altun raised eyebrows after openly backing the Blue Homeland doctrine and stating that Turkey had a “strong claim throughout history” to the eastern part of the Mediterranean sea.Originally created by retired Turkish admiral Cem Gurdeniz over a decade ago, the Blue Homeland doctrine came into the spotlight last year when tensions between Greece and turkey increased over Turkish research vessel activity in the Aegean.At one point last summer, Greece put its armed forces on alert over the issue and some, such as former Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, spoke out against Erdogan’s behaviour, stating that it may lead to military conflict.In early February, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke out against the German government’s continued plans to export several Type 214 Class submarines to Turkey despite the provocations from Ankara in the Aegean.Greek PM Unhappy with German Sale of Attack Submarines to Turkey https://t.co/yzHCXAi0HD— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2021London / EuropeNational SecurityAegean SeaBlue HomelandGreeceMediterranean SeaRecep Tayyip ErdoganTurkeyTurkish Expansionism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
732,"Children in England are being prescribed sex change drugs by foreign doctors over the internet without any parental consent, an investigation by a British newspaper has claimed.In the UK, the prescription of puberty blockers to children under the age of 16 has been mostly barred since December, unless expressly signed off by two specialist doctors and later approved by a court.However, an undercover investigation by the Daily Telegraph found that Europe-based online clinics are using a legal loophole to skirt the regulations. Despite Brexit, pharmacies in Britain are still accepting prescriptions — with a few exceptions — from doctors within the EU, allowing online clinics in Europe to prescribe English patients over the internet.In the investigation, a reporter posed as a 15-year-old girl who was seeking gender reassignment therapy. The online clinic, GenderGP, was reported to have prescribed the ‘child’ testosterone, after just two consultations over Skype and without any parental consent.The report said that GenderGP staff did not question the reporter’s belief that she was in fact a male, telling her: “we’re not worried about your truth because there’s no debate about that”.The prescription was signed by a doctor in Romania, however, the doctor was not even available for a consultation and the reporter was instead told to consult with a doctor in Egypt, who told the supposed 15-year-old girl that it was “excellent” that she planned on never having children.The Egyptian doctor, identified as Yasmeen El Rakhawy, told the reporter that online clinics such as GenderGP are not required to perform as much scrutiny “as other practices will do, or will demand”.“At no point will counselling sessions be enforced. At no point will the medical consultations be, you know, required regularly. It’s only if there’s ever a concern,” the doctor reportedly said, adding: “I have no concern that this is absolutely the right path for you… Getting to that first prescription is on the horizon now. You can anticipate that and I appreciate the excitement.”After just three Skype appointments and some emails with GenderGP, the reporter was allegedly given a prescription for the gender transition drugs.NHS 'Over-Diagnosing' Transgender Children, Psychologists Warn https://t.co/TvXTz3dtY2— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 15, 2019While the UK officially left the European Union at the beginning of the year, the loophole in which prescriptions from EU-based doctors are accepted in British pharmacies remains open.The practice of foreign doctors prescribing English patients has raised concerns over the fact that European doctors do not have access to NHS records and therefore may prescribe drugs that may be harmful to the patient. Doctors in the EU are also exempt from UK regulators.As opposed to the UK, some countries within the EU, such as France and Italy, mandate that pharmacists only accept prescriptions from doctors from within their respective countries.In response to the investigation, a teacher and transgender rights advocate, Debbie Hayton, told the paper that the legal loophole should be closed.“For a doctor in Eastern Europe to prescribe a class three controlled drug to a child they have never spoken to is an egregious breach of protocol and safeguarding…the adults need to be called to account,” Hayton said.When questioned about the practice of prescribing life-altering drugs to children, GenderGP told the paper on Thursday that “not all parents are supportive” and therefore, when children are able to provide consent “in their own right, then that treatment can be appropriate and necessary”.The paper also claimed that GenderGP confirmed to them that they have previously prescribed sex-change drugs to children as young as twelve-years-old, and puberty blockers to children as young as ten.The clinic said that while there are “no formal qualifications in this field” their specialists are “very experienced and fully educated in transgender healthcare”. The clinic also claimed that their doctors are bound by the regulations of their local countries.GenderGP went on to say that it treats children by “stage not age”, claiming that there might be instances in which there are “compelling reasons” to provide sex-change drugs to a child as young as twelve if the child is “completely aligned with their gender identity”.“GenderGP operates according to a gender-affirming model of care. Transgender patients of all ages who come to our service can be assured of receiving belief, support and compassionate access to medical care,” the clinic said.‘Transgender’ Children as Young as Ten Legally Changing Names Rising https://t.co/nss5hV3WC0— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 14, 2019On its website, GenderGP denounced the investigation as “fake news”, saying that the report will not “impact our commitment to the community.”“We will continue to do everything that we can to ensure that those people who need care have access to it. GenderGP is an international organisation which operates 100% legally and we are committed to improving trans-healthcare at a fundamental level throughout the world.“Trans people exist, the treatment pathways are clear. The scandal is not that GenderGP is providing care but that national healthcare providers are withholding care. We will never give up,” the clinic pronounced.The founder of the clinic, GP Dr Helen Webberley, was suspended by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in 2018 after it was found that she had prescribed hormones to a twelve-year-old child, yet no finding of fact was made against her practice.Dr Webberley was later fined for operating an unlicensed transgender clinic from her home, for which she faces a “substantive” General Medical Council hearing in July. She has since moved to Spain, from where she operates the online clinic.U.K.’s High Court Rules Children Under 16 Cannot Make Wise Decisions on Hormone Treatments to Alter Biological Sex https://t.co/jgjdqSYheG— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 2, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeEUEuropean UnionLGBTLGBT agendaLGBT childrenpuberty blockersRomaniaSex changeTransgendertransgender childrentransgender clinicsTransgender Kidstransgender medicinetransgender youthUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
733,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage reported on Saturday that an entire boat of illegal migrants tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus after being escorted into British territorial waters by the French Navy.Mr Farage claimed that he received a tip-off from Dover, informing him that at least forty migrants have crossed the English Channel on Saturday morning. By the end of Saturday, a total of 87 detected boat migrants had been landed on England’s southern coast.On one of the boats, all twelve illegals tested positive for the coronavirus, Farage reported. The Daily Mail reported comments by the Home Office which contradicted those claims, however, noting that just one migrant tested positive on Saturday.The Reform UK party leader noted that coronavirus cases in the migrant hotspot of Dunkirk, France are amongst the highest in the country. He went on to point out that while coronavirus cases have been falling in Kent as a whole, the Dover area — where migrants are typically brought ashore in the UK — is seeing a spike in cases.“We have given the French government another £28 million to stop these migrant boats from coming and yet, this week the French navy is still escorting these vessels across into British waters,” Farage told TalkRadio on Saturday.“We are literally paying the French to now import COVID into the United Kingdom at the same time we are being told by [Health Secretary] Matt Hancock to stay home and I think that is outrageous,” he said.Mr Farage went on to malign the disparity in treatment for those arriving legally by air, who are forced to pay the government £1,750 to stay in a quarantine hotel, in comparison to illegal migrants, who are housed at taxpayer expense.“If you are worried about coming into Britain, just come by dinghy, the sea is dead flat, it is very safe today and you won’t get charged anything for your hotel,” Farage joked.“Once again last week we get [Immigration Minister] Chris Philp and [Home Secretary] Priti Patel does it every few months, they give the big speech, how we are going to stop it all from happening, we are going to turn the boats around, it’s all going to end and I think they do it just to calm down the backbenchers,” he added.We are paying the French Navy to escort migrants with Coronavirus into the UK whilst we are all told to stay at home. Outrageous. pic.twitter.com/DUkxLLfUBH— Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 27, 2021On Friday an additional 33 illegal migrants were brought ashore at the Port of Dover, with the Home Office claiming that French authorities stopped a further eleven from crossing, according to BBC reporter Simon Jones.Despite promises from Home Secretary Priti Patel that the government would “crackdown” on illegal boat migration following Brexit, the waves of migrants in the first two months of the year has remained on par with last year’s record numbers.Between Monday and Tuesday, some 126 illegal aliens were brought ashore in the UK, bringing the total number of crossings since Britain’s official departure from the European Union to over 400.The issue of the French navy escorting migrants across the English Channel was first highlighted by Mr Farage in May of last year when he filmed the French handover migrants to the British authorities. Mr Farage’s findings were later confirmed by Breitbart London through the use of transponder data from ships in the English Channel to confirm the meeting of the two craft.Aside from failing to stop the French from bringing migrants across the Channel, the British government has yet to sign a deal with the European Union or any member state on the return of failed asylum seekers. Last year, the number of foreign criminals deported by the Home Office fell by 79 per cent.While Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to “take back control” of the country’s borders, the nominally Conservative government has also refrained from implementing a turn back the boats approach like that taken by Australia, which has effectively cut off illegal boat migration through its Operation Sovereign Borders policy.‘Totally Unacceptable’ – Illegal Migrants Getting Vaccines Before At-Risk Brits at 4-Star Hotel https://t.co/rCPhPXD1aO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthImmigrationLondon / Europeasylum seekersBoat MigrantsChannel CrisisChannel MigrantscoronavirusdiversityEnglish ChannelEurope Migrant CrisisFranceFrench Navyhome officeIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationIllegal MigrantsMass MigrationMigrant Boatsmigrant campsMigrant CrisisMulticulturalismNigel Faragepriti patelUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
734,"The Lund University found the majority of convicted rapists in Sweden are of migrant backgrounds and nearly half of rapists born abroad in a landmark study which is one of the first of its kind in the high-migration level nation.The study, which was published online on February 22nd, looked at a total of 3,039 convicted rapists and found that 59.3 per cent of the convicts came from ‘migrant backgrounds’ — first and second-generation migrants.For those offenders born outside of Sweden — 47.8 per cent in total — 34.5 per cent came from the North African and Middle Eastern region, while 19.1 per cent came from sub-Saharan Africa.Year After Breitbart Report, Swedish MSM Catch up on Migrant Background of Majority of Gang Rapists  https://t.co/QtdvJ0wV9h— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 22, 2018Just under a third of the offenders, or 32.5 per cent, were on some form of government welfare programme, while 38.6 per cent were said to have low levels of education.The authors of the study noted the paper came across a background of rising levels of rape in Sweden and lamented the lack of other research on the backgrounds of convicted rapists saying, “Unfortunately, studies on rape offenders’ characteristics in a Swedish context are absent and, as far as we are aware, there is only one previous study, which has evaluated this issue in regard to adult male-on-female rape offenders.”The other study cited, a 2020 study from researchers at Malmo University, looked exclusively at cases in the city of Malmo but also gound that the majority of rapists, 71 per cent, were from migrant backgrounds as well.Sweden: Sex Crimes Have Tripled Since 2014 https://t.co/h8edXiWcKJ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 10, 2019“Our findings are of particular importance for crime preventive efforts.

735,"A court in Kyiv ordered internet regulators to block over 400 websites in the country, many of them allegedly having ties to the Russian government, Ukrainian media reported Wednesday.Ukraine is currently at war with Russia-backed separatists in its eastern Donbass region, where fighters in both the Donetsk and Luhansk areas have declared themselves sovereign state entities. Kyiv regularly accuses the Russian government of exacerbating violence in the area; Moscow claims the fighters are merely ethnic Russians who are not tied to the Russian military.Russia is also illegally occupying the Crimea region of Ukraine after invading and “annexing” it in 2014.The Ukrainian news agency UNIAN reported that the district court in Kyiv ordering the blocking of the sites listed 426 offending outlets related to “a criminal offense under Part 3 of Article 190 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (gross fraud, or fraud committed through unlawful operations involving computers). The sanction provides for imprisonment for a term of three to eight years.” The court has not sentenced anyone to those terms, however, and this week’s ruling did not appear to target any individual in particular, only order limits on access to the websites in question.The ruling bans Ukrainians from accessing 426 websites and can be appealed, though at press time the appeals process, if there is to be one, has not yet begun.UNIAN noted that the ruling followed a similar declaration on Tuesday blocking several channels on the encrypted messaging application Telegram — similarly, channels Kyiv believed were “Russian assets.” The outlet linked the shutdown to Ukrainian intelligence experts finding evidence of “subversive” activity by “a massive Russian intelligence network” in the country.Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials revealed more concerning online behavior: hacking attacks on websites belonging to Ukraine’s security service and other defense or strategic sites. This time, however, the government did not blame the Russian government directly, though it had done so for other attempted hacks.Ukrainian authorities have escalated their targeting of alleged Russian disinformation at a time in which more Ukrainians than ever rely on the internet to keep up with news. A poll by marketing analyst Research & Branding Group found that over half of Ukrainians prefer the internet as a news source to television, the Kyiv Post reported Thursday. A minuscule two percent of the country prefer news on the radio or in print newspapers.“Just four years ago, in 2017, only 38% of Ukrainians were getting information from the web, while 58% preferred television,” the Post noted. The poll also found that Russian social media sites were losing popularity, with a growing number of Ukrainians are turning to American outlets like Facebook.The widespread action against websites or other media that Kyiv considers hostile to Ukraine’s sovereignty this week follows significant unilateral action on the part of President Volodymyr Zelensky to limit Russia’s influence in the country, given the delicate state of affairs in both Crimea and the Donbass region. Zelesnky took the bold step of banning several television networks from the country in early February tied to Russian businessman and close friend of President Vladimir Putin, Viktor Medvedchuk, identifying the networks as propaganda for an “aggressor country.”Preemptively responding to free speech concerns, Zelensky said in remarks in a meeting with European leaders that the decision had been difficult and was “by no means an attack on free speech.”“Sanctions against the media are always a difficult decision for any government except an authoritarian one. This decision was not a spur-of-the-moment decision,” Zelensky said, “but one that had been in the works, based on information over a long time from many Ukrainian government agencies.”Unlike the Kyiv court website shutdown, Zelensky’s move as president is more definitive and not subject to appeal.The presidential move banned Medvedchuk’s three networks: 112 Ukraine, NewsOne, and ZIK. The three issued a joint statement condemning Zelensky for what they called “political repression.”“With one stroke of a pen, Zelensky threw out 1,500 journalists and other employees of the three stations into the street and deprived millions of people of the right to receive objective information,” the networks’ statements read.In another move apparently meant to curb Russian influence in the country, Zelensky banned “Sputnik V,” Russia’s homemade Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate, from use in the country. Ukrainian health officials explained in a decree that no vaccine created “in a state recognized by the Ukrainian parliament as a state aggressor” would receive approval. Russia is the only country so designated.Putin approved the distribution of Sputnik V within Russia last year prior to the completion of Phase III clinical trials, raising suspicions of the product’s effectiveness and safety internationally. While states allied to Russia, particularly those with insufficient access to Western vaccines, have purchased doses, much of the developed world has shunned the vaccine candidate.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kulebo referred to Sputnik V as “a hybrid weapon of Russia against Ukraine.”Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.London / EuropeNational SecurityTechDonbassKyivRussiaSocial MediaUkraineVolodymyr Zelensky.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Yet the growing culture of vandalism is being fuelled in general by a reluctance of authority figures to actually condemn the attacks, Robert Poll of the UK-based Save Our Statues group told Breitbart London in relation to the destruction of the Elizabeth II bust in Canada.Mr Poll remarked: “Weak responses to previous instances of criminal vandalism have legitimised statues as targets and emboldened attackers. These are not just attacks on statues – they are attacks on our way of life, the symbols of our culture and values.

737,"Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has defended his strong stance against mass migration, saying the European Union’s relaxed attitude towards illegal border crossings “has turned the Mediterranean into a cemetery”.The national conservative leader offered his characteristically robust take on EU immigration policy in an interview with the German news outlet FOCUS, a translation of which has been seen by Breitbart London.“The main point of conflict between you and the EU is immigration. Why are you so opposed to the distribution of immigrants among EU member-states?” asked his interviewer, in reference to the EU policy of compulsory quotas for migrant redistribution which several conservative-leaning countries led by Hungary have been resisting.“Because it’s based on a wrong-headed concept,” Orbán explained.“We must take help to where the problems are, not bring those problems to Europe. The EU is creating illusions in the minds of people living in poorer countries. This is why we established the ‘Hungary Helps’ programme,” he said, referencing the Hungarian aid programme which helps Middle Eastern Christians, in particular, to rebuild their lives and communities in their historic homes.“[Migrants] want a European life and they believe that here they’ll be welcomed with open arms, but in fact they’ll end up in the hands of people-smugglers. Europe’s wrong-headed policies have generated a pull factor that has turned the Mediterranean into a cemetery,” he said.Indeed, the EU Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, has previously admitted that EU- and NGO-backed “rescue” missions in the Mediterranean Sea have “strengthened the business model” of people-smugglers by making crossings more viable, leading to more attempts to reach Europe and more drownings.Salvini: Migrant Drownings Caused by 'Do-Gooders' Re-opening Ports, Encouraging Smugglers https://t.co/AlAjFl8x2X— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2019Prime Minister Orbán and his government have strongly backed Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s national populist La Lega (League) party, who as interior minister adopted a robust stance on keeping the country’s ports closed to migrant transport ships and pursuing NGOs he alleged were aiding and abetting illegal immigration through the legal system.Mr Salvini left government when the left-populist Five Star Movement (M5S) replaced La Lega with the left-establishment Democratic Party (PD) as its coalition partner, with that alliance doing much to undo Salvini’s border policies — causing rises in crossings and drownings, which had been falling while he was in office.That left-leaning coalition has itself now been replaced by a so-called “technical government” with no real democratic mandate, as the Italian establishment struggles to avoid fresh elections which, current polling suggests, would see Salvini emerge leading the largest party.The prime example of the sort of “tough love” border stance favoured by the Hungarians is found in Australia, where the government has adopted a firm policy of turning back any illegal migrant boats and disallowing any asylum applications from migrants who do reach Australian shores — resulting in crossings attempts and drownings falling to essentially zero.On the question of immigration more generally, Prime Minister Orbán was clear that he favoured supporting local people to have the families which many feel they can no longer afford in the West as an alternative to importing foreigners to tackle population decline.“Hungary wants to address demographic challenges by supporting families and enacting strong family policy measures, not by inviting in immigrants. The Germans want to force their own pro-immigration policy on us. I have to reject that,” he insisted.The Hungarian government minister for families, Katalin Novák, recently discussed the philosophy underpinning the country’s family policy with Breitbart London at length.Exclusive: West Must Solve ‘Demographic Crisis’ or ‘Europe Will Be Lost’ – Hungary Govt https://t.co/mKBLaG3Py2— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021 ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsasylum seekersAustraliaBoat MigrantsBrexitBrusselsDemographicsDemographyEUEurope Migrant CrisisEuropean UnionfideszGermanyHungaryIllegal AliensIllegal Immigrantsillegal immigrationMass MigrationMediterranean migrant routeMigrant BoatsMigrantsViktor OrbánVisegrad.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
738,"A state-owned Chinese Communist Party (CCP) propaganda outlet described British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s call for “urgent and unfettered” access to the Xinjiang region of China as a “shameless imperialist act”.On Monday, Mr Raab called for United Nations investigators to be granted access to the province, alleging that the human rights abuses being carried out against the Uyghur Muslim population by the communist regime are happening on an “industrial scale”.In response, the Chinese state’s most belligerent mouthpiece, the Global Times, said: “The UK Foreign Secretary’s office is making a shameless imperialist act against China about human rights that has stunned Chinese people.”The propaganda outlet rejected the notion that the dictatorship in Beijing should be held accountable by the United Kingdom, saying that “the most important thing for us is to act based on China’s interests, instead of indulging London.”In more threatening language the Global Times pronounced: “We should do things favourable to China, making Britain fully aware of who China is.”“China now has enough strength to support the country to walk its own way while ensuring its own security. Forces that play politics with lies can only harm their own country in the end,” the paper added.The Global Times went on to suggest that the Chinese Communist Party should develop a “set of levers” to sanction what they term as “outside provocateurs” who challenge the regime on human rights abuses, writing: “China needs to explore what it can do in this regard.”‘Fervent Sinophile’ Boris Johnson Pushes for China Trade Deal, Despite Genocide Objections https://t.co/zyCogH355C— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 22, 2021The communist mouthpiece alleged that the British government was being ‘two faced’, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalling his intentions to restart trade negotiations with China at the same time Mr Raab presses the country on human rights issues.“London has closely followed Washington’s lead in the crusade against China. However, at such a climax, the UK occasionally blew the horn to call for strengthening cooperation with China. People cannot help but ask: Which face of Britain is true?” the paper questioned.Answering the question the Global Times pronounced: “This question has increasingly become meaningless. As an old capitalist country, the UK is naturally arrogant and profit-seeking, and showing arrogance has increasingly become a way for it to seek profits.”While the United States during the Trump administration classified the persecution of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang as a genocide, and the Canadian Parliament followed suit on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has rejected making the classification.Mr Johnson’s own party’s Human Rights Commission said in a January report that it believes “the CCP is committing mass atrocity crimes against the Uyghurs and others in [Xinjiang]… and that is evidence indicative of the crime of genocide.”Yet, Boris Johnson has said that declaring genocide in the concentration camp region of Xinjiang would need to be a “judicial matter“. The Prime Minister has also blocked bipartisan efforts in the Houses of Parliament to introduce a judicial review from the High Court before the UK signs trade deals with countries determined to be committing genocide. The genocide amendment is seen as particularly targeting China, which has been accused of committing genocide.Exclusive Video — ‘Torture and Rape’: Uyghurs in London Protest Communist China’s Concentration Camps https://t.co/NOEFHdAqq8— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 9, 2019On Tuesday, the government rejected a proposed compromise that would empower five members of the House of Lords with judicial backgrounds to advice a House of Commons select committee, rather than the High Court.A crossbench peer, Lord David Alton said that the decision to block the compromise has “come from higher up the food chain”, claiming that it was “bound up with high politics and vested interests”.“We have failed to predict genocide, we have failed to prevent genocide, we have failed to protect victims of genocide and we have failed to prosecute perpetrators of genocide,” he said adding: “The genocide amendment is a modest attempt to begin to address some of those failings.”The genocide amendment did pass the House of Lords on Tuesday again by 367 votes to 214, meaning that the government will be forced into a third vote on the matter in the House of Commons.However, government minister Lord Gerry Grimstone indicated that the government would seek to block the amendment for the third time, and final time, saying that the issue of trading with genocidal regimes is ultimately a “political question”, claiming that the amendment would  “upset the constitutional separation of powers.”Meanwhile, Ruth Barnett and Dorit Oliver Wolff, both Holocaust survivors, have called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to stand up against the alleged genocide in Xinjiang, writing: “Trade is not worth the price of a people. We simply cannot stand by when others remain silent. We cannot stand by whilst we carry on business as usual.”BREAKING: #GenocideAmendment with @neill_bob amendment incorporated passes the @UKHouseofLords  367 214 another huge majority of 153It's the only amendment going to @HouseofCommonsMeanwhile 👇pic.twitter.com/jOQxU9aK2B— Luke de Pulford 裴倫德 (@lukedepulford) February 23, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaAsiaLondon / EuropePoliticsBoris JohnsonChinaChinese Communist PartyChinese propagandaCommunist propagandaDominic RaabGenocideGlobal TimesUnited KingdomXinjiangXinjiang concentration camps.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
739,"People traffickers in the Mediterranean sea are allegedly using pregnant women as “weapons” to encourage public sympathy for mass migration.In the last few weeks, pregnant women have been present on several migrant boats, particularly those landing on the Italian island of Lampedusa.The presence of pregnant women has lad some to speculate that people traffickers may be using such vulnerable women as a means to increase their business by attracting the attention of authorities for quicker rescues and also influence public opinion, newspaper Il Giornale reports.One child was even recently born aboard one of the migrant boats in recent days before being rescued along with 88 other migrants by a freighter vessel and transferred to the Italian coastguard which dropped the migrants off on Lampedusa.The cruel alleged tactic can easily spell absolute disaster, however. In December, four pregnant women were among 20 migrants who drowned trying to reach Europe on an unseaworthy boat. A report in The Sun newspaper linked the deaths with an increase in people smuggler activity in the area at the time.A boat carrying 48 African migrants sank this weekend off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa, leaving one dead and 22 still missing. https://t.co/bg8VRUZbYZ— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 16, 2021According to Il Giornale, the number of migrants arriving on Lampedusa from January 1st to February 23rd has nearly doubled compared to last year, with 4,157 migrants arriving within that period.The last two weeks, in particular, have seen over 1,500 arrivals to the island, either through independent migrant boats or through migrant taxi NGO ships picking up migrants in the Mediterranean.The Lampedusa reception centre, which is meant to house just 192 people, is also overwhelmed with at least 900 current occupants.Last summer, the island faced similar tissues with overcrowding and ran out of space to quarantine newly arrived migrants who may be infected with the Wuhan coronavirus.Lampedusa Mayor Toto’ Martello decried the situation last August and questioned why a state of emergency had not been declared to deal with the influx of new migrants.The potential spread of the Wuhan coronavirus continues to be a constant issue for Italy regarding new arrivals of illegal migrants and of the 422 migrants brought to Sicily earlier this month by the NGO SOS Mediterranee, at least 49 migrants tested positive for the virus.Italian Study Claims Asylum Seekers Could be Used to Reverse Rural Population Decline https://t.co/QyYYJ9OmGE— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 21, 2021ImmigrationLondon / EuropeItalyLampedusaMass MigrationMediterranean migrant routepeople traffickingpregnant migrantspregnant women.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
740,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) – The advocate general for European Union’s highest court on Thursday urged the court to rule that Hungary violated the bloc’s laws on asylum when it passed legislation narrowing the possibilities for asylum-seekers to receive international protection.The non-binding opinion from the European Court of Justice’s Advocate General, Athanasios Rantos, states that the 2018 amendments to Hungary’s asylum laws – which prohibited asylum-seekers who passed through safe countries en route to Hungary from receiving international protection – violated EU law.“By introducing that ground for inadmissibility, Hungary has failed to fulfill its obligations under the Procedures Directive,” Rantos wrote, referring to the EU’s asylum protocols.Opinions by advocates general are often but not always followed by the European Court of Justice, which will make a final ruling on the case at a later date.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, brought the case before the court as part of an infringement procedure it launched against Hungary in 2018 over its non-compliance with asylum law.Rantos also advised the court to rule that a Hungarian law that cracks down on organizations and individuals that provide legal assistance to asylum-seekers violates EU law. The legislation, known as the “Stop Soros” law, was an amendment to Hungary´s criminal code that threatened aid workers and human rights advocates working with asylum-seekers with up to a year in prison. It was approved by the Hungarian parliament in 2018.The law was named after Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, a pro-democracy advocate who has long been a target of the Hungarian government.Hungary’s right-wing government has been a staunch opponent of immigration, and its treatment of migrants have brought it into frequent conflict with the rest of the 27-nation EU. Last year, the country closed its transit zones – enclosed areas along the southern border with Serbia used to hold asylum-seekers while their asylum requests were being decided – after the European court ruled they amounted to detention and thus violated EU law.Last month, the EU´s border control agency, Frontex, suspended operations in Hungary after the government in Budapest did not comply with a December ruling by the European court that ordered Hungary to grant protection to asylum-seekers as required by law and to stop returning them to Serbia.The country’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, claims he is seeking to protect Hungary’s conservative Christian identity and to defend Europe from immigration from the Mideast and Africa.ImmigrationLondon / EuropeEurope Migrant CrisisEuropean Court of JusticeEuropean UnionHungaryViktor Orbán.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

742,"Attacks on French police officers have more than doubled in 20 years, with an average of 85 incidents against public authority officials recorded every day.The statistical services of the French Ministry of the Interior have recorded a 2.3-times increase in the number of attacks in the last twenty years and Interior Minister Gerald Darmamin stated that the development should not be “trivialised.”Jean-François Papineau, a 37-year police veteran and head of public security in Northern France, noted how much more violent the attacks have become saying, “it is no longer hostility but a call to murder.” French newspaper Le Monde reports.According to the report, the French regions with the highest levels of assaults on officers are Paris, the notorious Parisian no-go-zone suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, and finally, the densely populated judicial area département du Nord that contains the city of Lille, on the Belgian border.French Police Look Tto Create New 'Super Riot Cops' to Combat Urban Violence https://t.co/6EwAfNuf92— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 10, 2021Police boss Papineau commented on an incident earlier this month in Villeneuve-d’Ascq in which a police officer in his region had been attacked by a gang of minors and required twelve stitches to his face as a result of the attack.“This is a fundamental trend, which involves an active minority attacking the symbol of authority through police officers, who embody the permanent link between the state and the population. We are no longer just in a territorial challenge to the control of drug trafficking, but in questioning the very role of the institutions,” he said.The estimates of 85 incidents per day on average may actually be an underestimate according to Le Monde, which states that many lesser attacks which do not result in injuries to officers are not reported at all.Lawyer Virgile Reynaud, who specialises in defending police officers, said that other police may not report the incidents in fear of being taken off active duty.“These officers see their mission as to be on the street, in contact with offenders, and they want to stay there. On the other hand, they also want justice to punish their attackers,” Reynaud said.As anti-police violence continues in France, some have called on the government to create a new department within the riot police, the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS), to specifically handle incidents of urban violence.Others, such as police in Nantes, have decried the light punishments for those who attack police, particularly far-left Antifa black bloc militants who target officers at protests.French Police Complain Over Lack of Punishment for Far-Left Black Bloc Militants https://t.co/Xs9Eq0DUJZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 28, 2021Law and OrderLondon / Europeanti-policeanti-police violenceFranceFrench policeLilleParisPoliceSeine-Saint-Denisurban violence.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
743,"Europe’s best-selling tabloid Bild has congratulated the British government on its coronavirus vaccine rollout, stating that Germany “envies” the United Kingdom.The newspaper’s print edition ran the headline “Dear Britain, WE ENVY YOU!” emblazed on top of a Union Jack on the front page of the newspaper’s February 24th edition. It noted the timeline given by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which aims to lift all coronavirus restrictions in England by June 21st at the earliest.Bild, which has the highest circulation of any newspaper in Europe, compared the daily vaccination rates of the United Kingdom — which is presently giving shots to an average of 360,000 people per day — to that of Germany, which has managed an average of just 140,000 per day.“While the British are already planning their summer holidays, Germany is stuck in the lockdown,” the newspaper wrote.Germany’s Vice-Chancellor Olaf Scholz has reportedly criticised European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s vaccine programme, calling it “really shit”. https://t.co/K6krcnYBzF— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 6, 2021Chancellor Angela Merkel has not made mention of reopening the country in the spring or the summer but has instead focused on warning of another potential wave of infections.Helge Braun, head of the Federal Chancellery, warned that March, April, and May could be “difficult months” and opening up the country in March could lead to a “sharp increase” in new coronavirus infections.The headline comes after weeks of severe criticism of the European Union and German federal government, as it became clear the extent to which they were lagging behind newly-free Brexit Britain. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen even compared the United Kingdom to a “speedboat” in remarks on the scandal, for which she has personally taken significant criticism.Britain Leads the World: Harshest Lockdown in West, But Significant Death Rates https://t.co/vtH7VNDHNC— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2021While Britain has been radically successful in getting vaccine shots to more people — with over 27 per cent of Britons now having had a dose, compared to just six per cent in Europe as a whole — the country is also experiencing high death rates. In fact, according to official figures, Britain has one of the highest death rates from coronavirus in the world, at 1,781 per million head of population. Germany has seen 826 deaths per million, one of the lowest rates in Europe.On vaccinations, the United Kingdom has also seen proposals to make getting the shot a requirement for entering certain businesses and venues, including cinemas and air travel. After months of denials, the Prime Minister said the government was looking into a “Covid status certification” for individuals as part of rolling back the lockdown this week, prompting anti-nanny state campaigners to note sardonically that the government had misspelt “Covid passports”.Earlier this month, the British Department for Health and Social Care, the Department for Transport, and the Foreign Office stated that they were working on a “vaccine passport” for holidaymakers who wanted to visit destinations abroad, such as Greece.In the private sector, several companies have approached law firms to create employment contracts that would require the vaccine in order to be hired.An unnamed lawyer spoke to the Financial Times saying that some companies could run afoul of discrimination laws if those who refused the vaccine did so for religious reasons or for underlying health issues.“I do think that we are going to be in a position where we have to have an annual coronavirus vaccine, and that annual vaccine will be tailored to the variant strains in the UK at that particular moment."" https://t.co/BNrl698bfA— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 2, 2021HealthLondon / EuropeAngela MerkelBoris JohnsoncoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCOVID-19GermanylockdownspandemicUnited KingdomvaccinationVaccinevaccinesWuhan coronavirusWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
744,"Knife crime in Britain has doubled in the previous six years, rising above 50,000 incidents in a one-year period in England and Wales for the first time in the recorded history.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that in the year leading up to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s imposition of the first coronavirus lockdown, crimes involving a knife or a sharp weapon rose by six per cent, up from 47,388 to 50,019. This latest figure is more than double the 23,945 offences recorded in 2014, the point at which the general historical trend of crime falling went into reverse.The report found that 44 per cent of the knife crimes (22,012) were violent assaults, and 44 per cent (21,961) were robberies, which rose from 18,518 to 20,196 in the year leading up to March of 2020Homicides, in general, rose by seven per cent, with 695 people losing their lives in violent attacks. Figures from the Home Office revealed that during the same time period, there were 4,344 threats to kill with a knife, representing a 22 per cent jump over the year before.As Breitbart London has reported in the past, murders have not risen as dramatically as other crimes not because streets are getting safer, but because urban hospitals are becoming more adept at saving the lives of people who would have otherwise died of their wounds, even in the recent past. A 2018 study found that improving hospital care had the impact of converting hundreds of would-be murders into attempted murders or other lesser crimes instead.The rise of serious, non-murder crimes illustrate that change. The latest ONS figures reveal sexual assaults with knives rose by over 25 per cent, from 156 to 196, however, rapes committed with knives fell by 8 per cent to 483.The Conservative government’s minister for crime and policing, Kit Malthouse told The Times: “Too many young lives are being needlessly lost. We are working closely with the police and others to stop this senseless bloodshed, particularly as Covid restrictions are eased over coming months.“We are making sure the police have the resources and support they need, including bolstering their ranks with 20,000 new officers. At the same time, the government is investing millions into Violence Reduction Units to tackle the root causes of violent crime, while our £200 million Youth Endowment Fund supports vital projects that steer young people away from a life of crime.”Nevertheless, the Conservatives have been in power — at first in coalition and then governing alone — for over a decade, during which time this recent six-year crime surge wholly took place.Khan’s London: Homicides Soar Past 100 for Sixth Straight Year https://t.co/yn4SA8JOY9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 10, 2020Under consecutive Conservative governments between 2010 and 2018, the number of officers in the country fell by over 21,000 in England and Wales, meaning that despite “bolstering” the ranks with 20,000 additional cops, it will still be lower than when the Tories came into power.The period of Conservative rule has also seen an increased emphasis placed on the policing of so-called hate offences, with police recording some 120,000 non-crime hate incidents since the implementation of the scheme in 2015.Last week, a police force in Merseyside embarked on a public “hate crime awareness event”, in which they appeared in a local car park with a van that wrongly stated: “Being Offensive is an Offence”.In response, Brexit leader Nigel Farage questioned: “Are there no problems with gun or knife crime in Merseyside then?”Mr Farage has long decried the focus on political correctness as opposed to actual policing of violent crime, saying in 2018: “Political correctness has directly led to the murder rate going up in London,” pointing to London Mayor Sadiq Khan and then-Prime Minister Theresa May’s focus on “hate crime”.Perhaps one of the reasons why the Conservative governments have so far failed to meaningfully tackle key issues to base voters such as migration and knife crime has been — with the exception of Mr Farage in recent years — the lack of any credible opposition party to hold them to account for their failings.An article from Samuel Earle in the New Republic this week noted that during the 200-year history of the Conservative Party, only four of the nineteen leaders who stood for elections failed to win at least one time. Conversely, the Labour Party, which was founded in 1900, only four leaders have won an election.“Rarely has a political party wielded so much power, for so long, with so little accountability,” Earle noted, add: “If elections in Britain tend to take one of two forms, “kick them out” or “let’s keep going,” the Conservative Party’s trick is to appear as the answer to both, as it suits: the brave challengers of the status quo and its brave defenders, always rescuing the nation from a Labour threat that never quite materializes.”Khan’s London: ‘Up to Forty’ Males Fight Street Battle with Swords, Knives, Broken Bottles https://t.co/LjKFH0PdpV— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 19, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaCrimeLondon / EuropeBoris JohnsonFaragekit malthouseKnife crimeoffice for national statisticsuk crimeUK policeUnited KingdomViolent Crime.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
745,"At least ten former staff members are ready to come forward as claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex bullied and “humiliated” aides are probed.Allegations that Meghan, the former Suits starlet and wife of Prince Harry, inflicted “emotional cruelty and manipulation” on staff are being investigated by Buckingham Palace, after a former aide revealed she had been the subject of a bullying complaint and accused her of driving a number of people out of their jobs.“A group of people are queuing up to be involved. They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face. Our eyes met and she lowered hers, humiliation etched on her features.”Prince William Angered by Meghan and Harry's 'Insulting, Disrespectful, and Petulant' Attitude to Queen https://t.co/kvuRJbdJA9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021Before Meghan and Harry abandoned their duties as working royals — but not their titles — to pursue money-making ventures and activism in the United States, their communications secretary wrote to Prince William’s private secretary said he was “very concerned that the Duchess [of Sussex, Meghan] was able to bully two PAs out of the household in the past year. The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
746,"DUBAI (AFP) — Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is enjoying an extended honeymoon with oil-rich Gulf nations, despite being criticised in the United States and Europe as a potential security threat.Arab Gulf countries — strategic partners of Washington that are seeking to diversify their economies — are investing heavily in the sector as their appetite for technology grows.Huawei has struggled in recent years in the face of US sanctions, as Washington claims Huawei has close ties to China’s military and that Beijing could use its equipment for espionage — accusations the company denies.Britain and Sweden have banned the use of Huawei equipment in their 5G networks, while France has also imposed restrictions.Yet Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have not only chosen Huawei for their 5G rollouts, but have also partnered with the company to develop “smart cities.”These feature enhanced digital services and security surveillance — a Huawei speciality Gulf states value highly for monitoring their populations.Gulf countries’ “use of technologies for population surveillance is closer to the practices of China than those of Western countries,” said Camille Lons, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Concerns about Huawei voiced in the US and Europe “weren’t convincing” in the region, she told AFP.– Mitigating ‘political pressures’ –While the telecoms giant has had a strong presence in the Gulf since the 1990s, its deals and big announcements there have multiplied in recent years.In January, Saudi Arabia announced it would open the largest Huawei store outside China in Riyadh, a few months after a deal with the company on developing artificial intelligence to support public and private sector growth.Last summer, Saudi investment firm Batic cemented a deal with Huawei to work on “smart city” projects in the kingdom, where it is already a main partner in the Yanbu Smart Industrial City project on the Red Sea.Huawei has also developed apps and digital infrastructure to support Muslim pilgrims visiting Mecca and Medina, Islam’s two holiest sites.“By gaining the trust of our partners in the Middle East, we have been able to mitigate external political pressures like those pursued by the US,” Charles Yang, Huawei’s Middle East chief, told AFP from the company’s headquarters in Dubai.In the high-tech emirate, one of seven that make up the UAE, Huawei has launched projects ranging from data storage to online payment services for public transport networks.Dubai-based Emirates, the Middle East’s largest airline, last year chose Huawei to build a centre to boost the company’s surveillance and security capabilities.An Emirates spokesperson declined to elaborate on the precise nature of the technology, but said “such solutions are utilised… around the world primarily for public safety and security reasons”.– ‘Risk’ for the US –China remains one of the Gulf’s leading trade partners.UN figures show its 2019 trade with Saudi Arabia — the world’s largest exporter of crude oil — reached about $36.4 billion, while with the UAE it exceeded $50 billion.“Digital infrastructure has become a key pillar of (Gulf states’) national transformation strategies,” Yang said.Huawei said this month it hoped for a reset with Washington, after former US president Donald Trump targeted the firm as part of an intensifying China-US trade and technology standoff.But Lons from the International Institute for Strategic Studies warned the apparent Huawei-Gulf honeymoon could cause security worries for the US.She noted the presence of American military bases in the region, and that Gulf countries are “major buyers of US military equipment”.There could be concerns about the “risk that sensitive US military information or technology is being spied on and transferred to China”, she said.Israel / Middle EastLondon / EuropePoliticsAustraliaDonald TrumpHuaweiSaudi ArabiaukUnited Arab Emirates (UAE).Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
747,"Far-left French anarchists have taken credit for two arson attacks on a telecommunications company in the latest act of infrastructure sabotage claimed by far-left militants.The two attacks took place last week in the communes of Brézins on Thursday the 18th of February and another in the commune of Sassenage, near the city of Grenoble on the night between Friday the 19th and Saturday the 20th.Both arson attacks targetted the French telecommunications company Constructel and saw damage to company vehicles as well as fibre optic cables, which are used to deliver high-speed internet, destroyed. In Sassenage, a 300-metre fibre optic tower was also set on fire, according to a report from broadcaster Franceinfo.Earlier this week, far-left Antifa anarchist extremists took credit for the attacks on the far-left web platform Indymedia, stating, “We claim the double attack in Isère of the company CONSTRUCTEL. First in Brezins and 48 hours later in Grenoble.”#Isère : les incendies qui ont touché l'entreprise Constructel revendiqués sur un site anarchistehttps://t.co/Xf8z6Kp5Eb pic.twitter.com/tAVksPp86R— France 3 Alpes (@f3Alpes) February 23, 2021The anarchists explained their motive for the attacks saying, “it is not to protest against 5G in particular but in a broader context, fighting against the techno-world.”“We want to salute all the arsonists who are acting in the shadows at the moment and repeatedly beating this technological hell,” the anarchists said and expressed support for the far-left militants currently being prosecuted for terrorism after allegedly plotting to murder French police officers and soldiers.The attacks are just the latest in a trend of attacks on communications infrastructure by Antifa militants in France and come just two years after anarchists took credit for setting fire to a radio station belonging to broadcaster France Bleu in Isère as well as setting fire to a transmitter located just outside Grenoble.France: Far-Left Antifa Extremists Possible Suspects in Mass Sabotage of Internet Infrastructure https://t.co/ydwvfFowXn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 8, 2020The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an NGO that defends journalists rights and press freedom, reported in 2019 that local prosecutor Eric Vaillant had stated that the same far-left anarchist group had taken credit for at least 12 arson attacks in the Grenoble area since 2017.In 2020, anarchists were suspected of being behind several more arson attacks on infrastructure including an attack on a broadcast relay in May of last year that disrupted local radio broadcasts and put many in southern Grenoble without mobile internet or telephone service.Prosecutor Eric Vaillant made attempts to refer the cases to the French national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office last year, but the office ultimately rejected taking up an investigation into the anarchist attacks.Far-Left Anarchist Extremists Indicted Over Terror Plot To Kill Police https://t.co/WjN4FeNweQ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 15, 2020Earlier his year in January, French National Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism Coordinator Laurent Nuñez claimed that far-left militants in France had been behind at least 170 acts of sabotage since March of 2020, with telecommunications infrastructure accounting for nearly 60 per cent of the targets of attacks.Arson attacks on telecommunications infrastructure have also been reported in other European countries such as the Netherlands and Italy, according to newspaper Le Parisien that noted: “ultra-left networks are known to maintain close links with their foreign counterparts.”One act of sabotage in Italy saw anarchist extremists set fire to a railway electrical hub just outside the city of Florence in 2019, causing hours of delays for passengers of high-speed trains.Far-Left Anarchists Suspected of ‘Terrorist’ Sabotage After Italian Train Chaos https://t.co/HprHlMM9wF— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 23, 2019In Canada, similar train sabotage was called for by Antifa extremists in 2020 in support of an anti-pipeline protest and allegedly in solidarity with the Wet’suwet’en First Nation.Canadian transport minister Marc Garneau later confirmed that part of the Canadian railway infrastructure had been tampered with.In 2018, anarchists in the Canadian French-speaking province of Quebec also took credit for the sabotage of a telecommunications network during the G7 summit that took place earlier that year.Like their French counterparts, the Canadian anarchists set fire to a telecommunications pole to disrupt communications in Quebec City and Baie-Saint-Paul.Law and OrderLondon / EuropeanarchistanarchistsAntifaFranceGrenobleinfrastructure sabotageSabotagetelecommunicationstelecommunications sabotage.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
748,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) – Doctors in Hungary on Wednesday began administering a COVID-19 vaccine developed in China, making the country the first European Union nation to use a Chinese jab as officials aim to bolster trust in its safety and effectiveness.General practitioners around the Central European country were instructed to administer the shots, developed by Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm, to elderly patients. The Sinopharm jab brings the number of vaccines currently in use in Hungary to five including the Russian-developed Sputnik V, more than in any other country in the 27-nation EU.But for the country’s expanded palette of vaccines to be put to full use, officials are seeking to increase lagging public trust in those produced in Eastern countries.“I ask for all fears to be dispelled about the Chinese and Russian vaccines, because more than 30 million people have received these vaccines without any particular problems,” Hungary’s chief medical officer, Cecilia Muller, said at a virtual media briefing Wednesday.Chief Eurocrat Admits EU Made Mistakes that Resulted in Vaccine Fiasco https://t.co/wMu4aBJQ1W— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2021Hungary´s government has sharply criticized the speed of the EU´s vaccine procurement program, and sought to purchase doses from countries like China and Russia despite polling that shows trust in those vaccines is low among Hungarians.A survey of 1,000 people in the capital of Budapest by pollster Median and the 21 Research Center showed that among those willing to be vaccinated, only 27% would take a Chinese vaccine and 43% a Russian vaccine, compared to 84% who would take a jab developed in Western countries. The poll, which was conducted at the end of January, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.Still, Hungarian officials expect that the Sinopharm vaccine, which received final approval last week, will provide a sharp boost in the country´s vaccination rate: as many as 368,000 people could be inoculated this week alone, compared with 471,000 that have received a shot since vaccinations began in December, state secretary Dr. Istvan Gyorgy said Tuesday, adding that 275,000 people will receive the Sinopharm jab this week.“Every vaccine available in Hungary is safe and able to provide protection against virus infection. This is true of the Eastern vaccines as well despite all rumors to the contrary,” Gyorgy said.German Vice-Chancellor Reportedly Slams 'Really S***' EU Vaccine Programme https://t.co/GVv3CedxOR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021In Budapest, Dr. Zoltan Komaromi began administering the Sinopharm vaccine Wednesday despite his personal concerns over the size of its trial samples and what he perceived as pressure from high-ranking government officials on Hungary’s health care authorities to approve the vaccine.“There is uncertainty because of politicians talking back and forth about the vaccines,” he said. “It looked very bad to ordinary people that the foreign minister and prime minister effectively called on authorities to give official approval.”Komaromi, who is also a health spokesman for a Hungarian opposition party, received 55 doses of the vaccine on Wednesday and sent emails to his patients informing them of all possible risks and side effects. Of the 120 patients he contacted, 22 said they would take the vaccine and 75 refused.The Hungarian government has accused opposition parties of fomenting distrust of its vaccination program, especially concerning those vaccines procured outside of the EU framework.A steady decline in new coronavirus cases and deaths that began in late December reversed course early this month, and the government has emphasized that speeding up vaccinations is the only way to head off an apparent “third wave” of the pandemic. Hungary’s procurement efforts have placed it in first place in the EU in the number of vaccine doses distributed to the country per 100 inhabitants, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, an EU agency.Hungary has agreed to purchase 5 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine over the next four months, enough to inoculate 2.5 million people with the two-round shot in the country of around 10 million. Successfully administering that quantity will depend on the level of public trust in Chinese and Russian vaccines, which Komaromi said has eroded after they were approved in Hungary without being inspected by the European Medicines Agency, the EU´s medicines regulator.Hungary Becomes First European Nation to Receive Chinese Sinopharm Coronavirus Vaccine https://t.co/hTmt9lrlOS— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021“The patients feel this, they know, they follow the news and unfortunately we (doctors) have to overcome this feeling of resentment in them one by one,” he said.As of Wednesday, 550,000 doses of Sinopharm had been delivered so far, compared with 774,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, and smaller shipments of vaccines from AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Russia’s Sputnik V.In an interview with public radio late last month, Hungary´s prime minister, Viktor Orban, said he would personally choose to be inoculated with the Sinopharm vaccine.“I´m waiting for the Chinese vaccine, I trust in that the most,” Orban said. “I think the Chinese have known this virus for the longest, and they probably know it the best.”Hajnalka Miklos, a retiree who received her first dose of the Sinopharm vaccine on Wednesday, said she was relieved to be vaccinated so she could spend more time with her parents and grandchildren, and that she had no reservations about receiving the Chinese jab.“I would have liked the Russian vaccine, or Pfizer, but this came, and I’m very glad,” she said.AsiaHealthLondon / EuropeChinacoronavirusHungarySinopharmVaccine.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
749,"BERLIN (AP) – A 33-year-old Italian man was convicted Friday of attempted extortion for threatening to blow up a British National Health Service hospital unless he was paid off with 10 million pounds ($13.2 million) in crypto currency.Defendant Emil A., a resident of Berlin whose last name wasn’t given in line with German privacy laws, was sentenced to three years in prison.Though he never made good on the threat against an unspecified hospital, it came during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic as the British health care system was struggling. British authorities stressed how seriously it was taken at the time.Nigel Leary, deputy director of Britain’s National Crime Agency’s cyber crime unit, said that because of the difficulty of evacuating patients in intensive care, “a mere phone call” threatening to plant an explosive in a hospital could have resulted in loss of life at the time.The court found that the defendant sent an email in April 2020 from his home to the NHS, threatening the attack on a hospital unless he received the funds in his Bitcoin account.The NHS did not respond, and the suspect proceeded to send another 17 threatening emails until his arrest in June, according to prosecutors.The suspect, who had studied computer science, had used an email address under the pseudonym “Combat 18,” which is a known neo-Nazi organization.British National Crime Agency officials said the suspect had used “Combat 18” merely as a front for the extortion to add “gravitas” to the threats, but did not in fact have any ideological link to the far right.They said he had no known links to the U.K. or its hospitals.While the threats began by targeting the public health service, NCA officials said that later on the suspect expanded his threats to include a Black Lives Matter protest and a U.K. lawmaker as potential targets.Investigators were able to track the suspect through his electronic trail despite his attempts to conceal it, said court spokeswoman Lisa Jani. He was arrested in a raid overnight June 15 by police SWAT teams and federal agents.During the course of their probe, investigators determined that A. had produced no bomb and had no specific target, Jani said.He can appeal Friday’s ruling.A. was already previously convicted of a similar threat against a Dutch company in 2013 and sentenced to 10 months probation.CrimeLondon / EuropeTechbitcoinbombBomb ThreatEuropean UnionGermanyItalyUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

751,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel claimed that there is a unanimous agreement within the European Union on implementing a coronavirus vaccine passport, during a virtual meeting of EU member states on Thursday.The German leader said that “everyone agreed that we need a digital vaccination certificate,” following the meeting of European leaders.Merkel said that such a system could be implemented as soon as the summer, but claimed that the introduction of a vaccine passport “does not mean that only those who have a vaccination passport are allowed to travel,” according to the German broadcaster DW.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen praised Israel’s implementation of ‘Green Passes’, a system in which the government tracks and documents an individual’s vaccination history in order to facilitate travel or to attend synagogues, theatres, concerts, or to go to the gym.While there has so far been no agreement within the EU as far as a standardised system, von der Leyen said that the Commission is working to craft a “gateway for interoperability between nations.”The embattled EU president did note that member states will “have to act fast” in order to implement a vaccine passport before the summer. To date, the European Union has only inoculated eight per cent of its population, compared to nearly 30 per cent in Brexit Britain.The failure to vaccinate a significant portion of the population has led to concerns that vaccine passports would be discriminatory. Angela Merkel admitted as much this week, saying: “As long as the number of those who have been vaccinated is still so much smaller than the number who are waiting for vaccination, the state should not treat the two groups differently.”“We feel that now this is the time for these vaccine certificates to be recognised across the European Union, and even beyond the European Union.”  https://t.co/UsZ0T3Wqw8— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 21, 2021Southern EU member states, such as Spain, Italy, and Greece have been pushing for the adoption of a COVID pass, in order to facilitate travel and prop up their fledgeling tourism industries. For countries like Greece in particular, tourism is a major part of their domestic economies and the Corona lockdowns have been devastating.Other countries, such as France, have expressed concerns about discrimination as well as the lack of evidence over whether vaccinated people can still transmit the Wuhan virus.Greek Deputy Prime Minister Akis Skertsos said that a vaccine passport system is “not discriminatory at all,” claiming that unvaccinated people could still visit Greece, but would face tougher restrictions such as being forced to be tested and self-isolate upon arrival.Greece, which has already signed an agreement with Israel to open up travel for those with ‘Green Passes’, is reportedly in talks with the UK to sign a similar agreement.There is a growing push within Britain’s notionally conservative government for the adoption of a vaccine passport, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggesting earlier this week that Brits might be required to carry health passes to even do make simple domestic visits like going to the pub or the theatre.“I know the fervent libertarians will object but other people will think that there is case for it,” Johnson said, going on to say that many countries will make vaccine passports a requirement.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson backed up the plan to carry passports to go to restaurants, cinemas, and theatres, telling LBC Radio on Wendesday: “I think I would probably do pretty much sort of anything to be able to enjoy all those lovely things.’“I think the idea of going to a restaurant with your family or going to the theatre is something we all really want to see,” Williamson added.Cabinet Minister Michael Gove will be heading up the government’s research into adopting a vaccine passport system, despite definitively stating in December that Brits would not be required to provide proof of vaccination to go to the pub.‘Covid Status Certification’: Boris Signals U-Turn on Domestic Vaccine Passports for Pubs and Theatres https://t.co/5smvtfDOWs— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthImmigrationLondon / EuropeAngela MerkelcoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineCOVID-19EUEuropean UnionGavin WilliamsonGreeceUnited KingdomUrsula von der LeyenVaccinevaccine passportVaccine Passportsvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
752,"Over 220,000 Britons have signed a petition against the introduction of coronavirus vaccine passports, potentially forcing Parliament to publicly debate the merits of such a scheme.The petition warns that vaccine passports would limit the rights of people who haven’t or can’t have, or refused a Covid-19 vaccine. Such government-enabled discrimination would be “unacceptable”, those behind the claim said. At the time of publication, the petition had attracted 222,000 signatures.The petitioners demanded, therefore, that the government commits “to not rolling out any e-vaccination status/immunity passport to the British public.”Westminster Hall debates on public petitions had been suspended during the lockdown, supposedly to help Members of Parliament social distance. That was reversed this week, however, as Parliament voted Thursday to restore the process for the first time in months.Under the terms of the government’s petition system, 10,000 signatures earns a response on the matter from the government. Once the signatures hit 100,000, the matter becomes eligible for a debate in Parliament itself. This petition means Parliament will likely debate vaccine passports for the first time.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that he would be tasking Cabinet Minister Michale Gove with heading up the government’s research on the logistics of a vaccine passport system. The appointment has raised some eyebrows, given Mr Gove himself stridently denied that the government was planning to introduce health passes as recently as December.Asked on live television whether Britons would need a pass to go to the pub, Gove gave a one-word answer: “no.”Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi has also denied that the government would force the public to carry vaccine passports, saying that such a measure would be discriminatory against those who can’t take the jab for medical or religious purposes.Yet, Boris Johnson signalled this week that the government is considering vaccine passports domestically as well as internationally, meaning that Britons could be forced to present their ‘COVID status’ papers before entering pubs, theatres, and other public venues.Vaccine Passports Could be Used in Supermarkets Suggests UK Foreign Secretary https://t.co/I6BWrbvLZd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021The head of policy and campaigns for the human rights pressure group Liberty, Sam Grant told the BBC that vaccine passports could “create a two-tier society where some people can access support and freedoms, while others are shut out – with the most marginalised among us hardest hit”.“The road out of lockdown can’t ride roughshod over our rights,” Grant said, adding: “That’s why we need the Coronavirus Act to be repealed, and replaced with strategies that provide support to help people to follow health guidance.”“That means rejecting proposals like immunity passports which are based on exclusion and division. Instead, we must work to bridge divides with strategies that protect everyone,” he concluded.Mark Johnson of Big Brother Watch said: “The British public rejected ID cards. We’re not a papers-carrying country. A vaccine passport is like an ID card via the backdoor – especially if you have to carry it on your person for day to day activities.”The notion of vaccine passports has taken off in Europe, which unlike Britain has an established recent history of authoritarianism and routine official paper-carrying, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel declaring on Thursday that the EU was in “agreement” over the issue and could implement the scheme by as early as the summer.‘Covid Status Certification’: Boris Signals U-Turn on Domestic Vaccine Passports for Pubs and Theatres https://t.co/5smvtfDOWs— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropePoliticsBoris JohnsoncoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineCOVID-19health passportimmunity passportUnited KingdomVaccinevaccine passportVaccine Passportsvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
753,"The European bishops have written a stern letter rebuking the European Parliament for its chastisement of Poland over a law preventing eugenic abortions.In October 2020, Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal outlawed abortions on the basis of fetal anomalies, insisting that there can be “no protection of the dignity of an individual without the protection of life.”While previously, babies with Down syndrome and other anomalies could be legally aborted in Poland, the court declared that aborting a child because of probable birth defects constituted eugenics, an effort to purify the race by purging society of the weak and undesirable.Abortion Giant Changes Name to Downplay Eugenicist Founder https://t.co/n02biD8Mqg— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 18, 2020The following month, the European Parliament (EP) intervened, issuing a formal resolution in which it “strongly condemns the Constitutional Tribunal’s ruling and the setback to women’s SRHR in Poland.”The ruling “puts women’s health and lives at risk,” the resolution stated, by limiting “access to safe and legal abortion in Poland,” adding that “universal access to healthcare and SRHR [which include abortion] are fundamental human rights.”The resolution went on to insist “that the performance of an abortion should not be included in the criminal code, as this has a chilling effect on doctors who refrain from providing SRHR services out of fear of criminal sanctions.”In their letter this week, the leaders of the Commission of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Union (COMECE) took issue with the EP resolution, insisting “that neither European Union legislation nor the European Convention on Human Rights provide for a right to abortion.”The bishops also accuse the EP of overstepping its mandate and usurping authority that resides in European Union member states.“A fundamental principle of the European Union is the principle of conferral, under which the Union shall act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the Member States in the Treaties to attain the objectives set out therein,” they recall.Polish Court Strikes Down Abortions Targeting Disabled Children https://t.co/yn6nkECmDG— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 24, 2020The rule of law “requires respect for the competences of the Member States and the choices made by them in the exercise of their exclusive competences,” the bishops assert.“COMECE is also alarmed about the fact that the Resolution seems to question the fundamental right to conscientious objection, which is an emanation of freedom of conscience,” the letter states. “This is particularly worrying considering that in the healthcare sector conscientious objectors are in many cases subject to discrimination.”“In our view, such unjust stigmatization should not be promoted,” they add.The bishops also underscore the importance of fundamental rights that risk being swept away in favor of partisan preferences.“It is necessary to consider fundamental rights — like freedom of thought, conscience and religion — in the light of their universality, inviolability, inalienability, indivisibility and interdependence,” they note. “In regard to the right to conscientious objection, the European Union Charter entails the need to respect national constitutional traditions and the development of national legislation on the issue.”They also express concern “that the principle of non-discrimination could be used to stretch or blur the limits of the competences of the European Union.”The bishops voiced their regret that while condemning Poland’s legitimate exercise of its sovereignty, the EP did not bother to denounce “the unacceptable attacks on Churches and places of worship in the context of protests related to this law in Poland.”We consider this matter crucial, they conclude, “aware as we are that the Resolution will have a very negative impact on the way the Union is perceived by Member States.”Follow @tdwilliamsromeMarriage Up, Abortion and Divorce Down as Hungary Chooses Family Support Over Mass Migration https://t.co/v3wPMRthNc— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 2, 2018FaithLondon / EuropePoliticsAbortionCatholic ChurchEugenicsEuropean ParliamentEuropean UnionPoland.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

755,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate.

756,"Shamima Begum, the teenager who left Britain to join the Islamic State and was subsequently stripped of her UK citizenship after she spoke out about having no regrets about joining the caliphate cannot return to get her citizenship back, the Supreme Court has ruled.The 21-year-old woman, who went to the Islamic State in Syria aged 15 in 2015 and who married an Islamist fighter in the so-called caliphate had launched a legal challenge against the British government from a prison camp in North Syria, in the hope of getting her UK paper citizenship back.Britain reacted in revulsion after the so-called Jihadi bride spoke out about her time in the Islamic State, telling a television news crew that seeing the severed head of a non-Muslim in a bin “didn’t faze me at all”. The government caved to pressure and revoked her citizenship on national security grounds.Begum’s lawyers had argued that she had a right to a fair hearing, and not being able to return to Britain to fight her case impacted on that. The Supreme Court demurred on the point, and ruled that her right to a fair trial did not outrank the rights of Britons to be safe from terrorism.Delingpole: Shamima Begum – Winning Western Hearts and Minds with the Gentle, Smiling Face of Islam… https://t.co/Pb0Hp0kM4H— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 19, 2019The President of the Supreme Court in London Justice Robert Reed said of the decision: “The appropriate response to the problem in the present case is for the deprivation hearing to be stayed – or postponed – until Ms. Begum is in a position to play an effective part in it without the safety of the public being compromised… That is not a perfect solution, as it is not known how long it may be before that is possible. But there is no perfect solution to a dilemma of the present kind.”While Begum made headlines at the time of her departure in 2015, when security footage of her and two other teenage girls walking through a British airport on their way to Turkey, the final stop-off before crossing the border into ISIS-controlled Syria, it wasn’t until 2019 when she reached her height of infamy. Rediscovered in a Syrian Free Democratic Forces prison camp as the Islamic State collapsed, Begum was interviewed by British journalists about her experiences .Her full and frank admissions about her time in the calpihate sealed her fate, however, as she willingly revealed the extent of her own radical attitudes and even regret that the Islamic State was falling. It was revealed she went to the Islamic State to get married, aged 15, to a Jihadi fighter and tied the knot with Dutch convert Yago Riedijk within ten days of arrival. She subsequently fell pregnant by him three times. While two of her children had already died by the time she was found in the camp, she was heavily pregnant and soon to give birth.Delingpole: ‘Bring Back Shamima Begum!’ Says No One Who Is Not a Leftist Loon https://t.co/3Sh1A0EJ7J— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 17, 2020In Feburary 2019, Begum said she wanted to return to the United Kingdom to give birth to her third child, which also subsequiently died in Syria. Speaking to British newspaper The Times, who had got a journalist to the prison camp, Begum said “I don’t regret coming” to the Islamic State and said that she had been “weak” to leave ISIS as it collapsed rather than stay to the bitter end.Perhaps the most extraordinary attitude of Begum to seeing “a beheaded head in the bin” which had belonged to a captured soldier executed by the Islamists. Noting that the event “didn’t face me at all”, she rationalised the lack of concern for the beheading by saying the man killed had been “an enemy of Islam” and that “I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance.”Her family defended the comments as an unfair representation of Begum, claiming the jihadi bride had Stockholm syndrome. Some argued she should be allowed to return to Britain to be “rehabilitated”.The UK Home Secretary of the time Savid Javid ordered Begum’s British citizenship be stripped, arguing due to the laws in her parent’s native Bangladesh she would be eleigible for citizenship there instead. Speaking to media after the decision from her Syrian prison tent, Begum responded to Javid’s decision to say: “I’m a bit shocked… It’s a bit unjust on me and my son.”Her challenge to overturn that decision — arguing that leaving an individual stateless is illegal under international law — was rejected in 2020. The court found she was “a citizen of Bangladesh by descent”, even though she’d never had a Bangladeshi passport.‘Out of Touch’: Labour Leader Slammed for Past Comments Backing Return of ISIS Bride Shamima Begum to Britain https://t.co/RwjEUksKZ0— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 20, 2020Law and OrderLondon / EuropeNational SecurityCitizenshipIraqIslamic StateSavid JavidShamima BegumSyriaUK Supreme CourtUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

759,"The British government is advising that secondary school pupils wear masks when they reopen — but that they cannot be made compulsory. Meanwhile, children as young as five are being told to wear masks at school, a report claims.“In line with public health guidance, we are also now advising that face coverings should be worn in secondary school classrooms as well as in further and higher education settings unless social distancing can be maintained,” the Secretary of State for Education, Gavin Williamson, has said, adding: “Again, this is to help reduce transmission. The risk to children themselves is incredibly low. This is a temporary measure to support the return of schools and will be in place until Easter, when it is reviewed.”But, according to operational guidance from the Department for Education (DoE) cited by the Telegraph, this advice should not be used as grounds to force masking on secondary school pupils, and “no pupil should be denied education on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering”.Some parents had been resistant to sending their children to school masked, with Molly Kingsley of the parents’ campaign group of parent UsForThem having said that, while it was “great that children will be back in school” from March 8th, “it should not be at any price – and certainly not at a price as grave as this.”In a separate report, the Telegraph notes that primary schools, which teach children between the ages of 5 and 11, are now telling pupils to mask-up, as well. Citing several examples of schools punishing such policies, the rule seems to go against the Department for Education’s clear guidance that staff should wear masks in primary school when in proximity to other adults, this is not necessary when in a classroom with children and that “children in primary school do not need to wear a face covering”.Boris Lays Out ‘Roadmap’ to Ending Lockdown by Summer, But Makes No Promises https://t.co/1BpLIjX7Da— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 22, 2021The claim that masks will not be compulsory in schools calls into question the consistency of government policy on schools, in particular the arguably much more invasive plan to subject pupils to regular coronavirus tests.It has previously been reported that pupils will be required to take four so-called lateral flow tests in the opening fortnight of the school term — three at school and one at home — with twice-weekly at-home tests thereafter, with results reported to teachers on a regular basis.This somewhat draconian system appears somewhat in question after the latest reports on masking, however, with the Telegraph saying that Department for Education guidance describes the lateral flow tests as “voluntary”.Confusingly, the DfE adds that “Pupils not undergoing testing should attend school in line with your phased return arrangements” but that “Schools will have discretion on how to test [pupils] over that week as they return to the classroom.”‘Covid Status Certification’: Boris Signals U-Turn on Domestic Vaccine Passports for Pubs and Theatres https://t.co/5smvtfDOWs— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2021EducationHealthLondon / EuropeBoris JohnsonBritainBritish SchoolscoronavirusCOVID-19Gavin WilliamsonlockdownlockdownsmaskspandemicschoolsUnited KingdomWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
760,"BERLIN (AP) – A former member of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s secret police was convicted Wednesday by a German court of facilitating the torture of prisoners in a landmark ruling that human rights activists hope will set a precedent for other cases in the decade-long conflict.Eyad Al-Gharib was convicted of accessory to crimes against humanity and sentenced by the Koblenz state court to 4 1/2 years in prison.It was the first time that a court outside Syria ruled in a case alleging Syrian government officials committed crimes against humanity. German prosecutors invoked the principle of universal jurisdiction for serious crimes to bring the case that involved victims and defendants who were in Germany.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the trial was a step against impunity in the conflict. His country has given refuge to hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing violence and hardship in their homeland, and backed international efforts to collect prosecutable evidence of crimes in Syria.But Russia and China have used their vetoes to block attempts by the U.N. Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court.“That´s why the cases outside Syria are big bright spots, but also a clear signal to the victims … that they shall get justice,” Maas told The Associated Press.Al-Gharib could have faced more than a decade behind bars, but judges took into account mitigating factors, including his testimony to German authorities investigating the allegations.The 44-year-old was accused of being part of a unit that arrested people following anti-government protests in the Syrian city of Douma and took them to a detention center known as Al Khatib, or Branch 251, where they were tortured.Al-Gharib went on trial last year with Anwar Raslan, a more senior Syrian ex-official who is accused of overseeing the abuse of detainees at the same jail near Damascus.Raslan is accused of supervising the “systematic and brutal torture” of more than 4,000 prisoners between April 2011 and September 2012, resulting in the deaths of at least 58 people.During his pretrial police interrogation, al-Gharib testified against Raslan, implicating him in more than 10 deaths of prisoners. A verdict in Raslan’s case is expected later this year.The court also considered photographs of thousands of alleged victims of torture by the Syrian government. The images were smuggled out of Syria by a former police officer, who goes by the alias of Caesar.“Today´s verdict is the first time a court has confirmed that the acts of the Syrian government and its collaborators are crimes against humanity,” said Patrick Kroker, a lawyer with the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which represented multiple survivors at the trial.“Testimony by torture survivors and intelligence officers, as well as the Caesar photos, prove the scale and systemic nature of enforced disappearances, torture and sexual violence in Syria,” he said. “The relevance of this evidence extends far beyond the proceedings in Koblenz.”Delivering the oral verdict, the presiding judge made it clear that al-Gharib’s crimes were part of the Syrian government´s systematic abuses against its own population. Syrian officials did not testify during the 60-day trial.The court concluded that al-Gharib’s unit, which was under Raslan’s command, was involved in chasing down and detaining at least 30 people following a demonstration in Douma, and then bringing them to the detention center where they were tortured.Al-Gharib, who had the rank of sergeant major until he defected, left Syria in 2013 and came to Germany in 2018. Both men were arrested a year later.Some rights groups have raised questions about the trial, noting that government defectors like Al-Gharib may not realize that statements they make during asylum applications may be used against them.Mohammad Al-Abdallah, director of the Washington-based Syria Justice and Accountability Center and a former prisoner in Syria, said Al-Gharib was a low-ranking officer with little value in the case against him.He suggested that putting defectors like Raslan and Al-Gharib in prison would please the Assad government, “because this will deter anyone else from defecting or joining the opposition or supplying information to human rights groups.”But Wassim Mukdad, a Syrian survivor and co-plaintiff in Raslan’s trial, said while al-Gharib was “just one small cog in the vast Syrian torture apparatus” the verdict against him was important.“I hope it can shed light on all of the Assad regime´s crimes,” he said. “Only then will the trial really be a first step on this long road to justice for myself and other survivors.”Al-Gharib’s lawyer, Hannes Linke, said the court’s verdict was “in large parts convincing” and that the sentence imposed on his client would “send a clear signal to war crimes perpetrators worldwide.” Linke said he would nevertheless appeal the verdict and ask Germany’s top court to review the lower tribunal’s decision to dismiss al-Gharib’s defense that he acted to avert harm from himself.The European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, which supports 29 survivors in the case against Raslan, of whom 14 are represented as co-plaintiffs in that case, is working to bring further cases against Syrian officials to trial in Germany, Austria, Sweden and Norway.CrimeImmigrationLondon / EuropeBashar al-AssadEurope Migrant CrisisGermanySyria.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

762,"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been accused of folding in the face of pressure from transgender lobbyists to allow people to ‘self identify’ their sex on the upcoming census, but the government body has denied the charge.A woman’s rights campaign group, Fair Play for Women, have launched a legal challenge at the High Court to stop the ONS from allowing people to be able to use the sex listed on their birth certificate, gender recognition certificate, or passport in the March 21 census.The change in guidance will mean that people will be able to change their sex on the census with just one note from a doctor to update their documents.Dr Nicola Williams, of Fair Play For Women, told the Mail on Sunday: “The ONS is unlawfully messing around with the definition of sex and allowing self-identification through the back door.”Dr Williams claimed that the LGBT activist group Stonewall had pressured civil servants into u-turning on the issue, saying: “The ONS has been captured by Stonewall. It’s a complete stitch-up.”She said that the ONS conducted a “biased” consultation on the issue of census sex question, as the statistician organisation failed to talk with a single women’s group critical of transgender ideology while consulting 23 trans people and “trans ally groups”.In January the head of the ONS, Professor Sir Ian Diamond said: “The question on sex is very simply your legal sex”.However, on February 12, guidance released from the ONS on the issue told people to “use the sex recorded on one of your legal documents such as a birth certificate, gender recognition certificate, or passport.”UK Judge Rules Belief That ‘Men Cannot Change Into Women’ Is ‘Not Worthy of Respect In a Democratic Society’ https://t.co/GU41SeSHxo— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 19, 2019The change was hailed by Stonewall’s Eloise Stonborough, who said: “Trans people have always responded to the sex question in line with who they are and how they live. This year’s Census offers clear and inclusive guidance on how everyone can answer the question using legal documents.”The Office For National Statistics claimed that the change in guidance did not come as a result of LGBT pressure, saying they came to the final decision in consultation with “a small number of researchers”.“This is the same binary question asked since 1801 – are you female or male. This is not self-identification, which was evaluated as part of a range of options but not taken forward,” an ONS spokesman said.“We did this because research showed this was the most help to people as they completed their Census form. It would therefore maximise response rates as well as meeting user needs,” the spokesman added.Professor of sociology at University College London Alice Sullivan scoffed at this assertion, saying: “It’s shocking.

We’ve never thought of having anything like this before, that you have to show when you go to a pub or a theatre.“There are deep and complex issues that we need to explore, ethical issues about what the role is for government in mandating people to have such things or indeed banning from people doing such a thing.”“I know the fervent libertarians will object but other people will think that there is case for it,” Johnson said, adding that a lot of countries will be “insisting on vaccine passports in the way that people used to insist on evidence that you’ve been inoculated against yellow fever or whatever.”The British leader did caution, however, that vaccine passports should not be used to discriminate against people who cannot take the vaccine, yet he failed to elaborate on what protections would be offered.On Monday, Mr Johnson said that part of the so-called ‘roadmap‘ to freeing Britons from the coronavirus lockdown restrictions, the government will be “reviewing” the role that “COVID status certification” may play in helping venues “open safely”.The civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch mocked the doublespeak type language from the Prime Minister, joking on social media that “Covid Status Certification is now how you spell vaccine passports”, the document that government ministers have spent months denying would be deployed.""Covid Status Certification"" is now how you spell ""vaccine passports"" 🙃A disturbing U-turn in the roadmap.And it is precisely because of the exclusion, discrimination and privacy concerns that millions of us will never accept them. pic.twitter.com/GlWE0GBdKz— Big Brother Watch (@BigBrotherWatch) February 22, 2021Separately, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) — which has been working with the British government to develop the coronavirus passport app — has said that their digital passport project will be ready to be implemented “within weeks”.Vinoop Goel, IATA’s regional director of airports and external relations, told The Telegraph: “We are currently working with a number of airlines worldwide and learning from these pilots. And the plan is to go live in March,” adding: “So basically we expect to have a fully functional working system over the next few weeks.”Goel defended the scheme, which has been criticised for infringing upon person liberties, by saying “the key issue” in reopening travel “is one of confidence”.“Passengers need to be confident that the testing they’ve taken is accurate and will allow them to enter the country. And then governments need to have the confidence that the tests that the passengers claim to have is one which is accurate and meets their own conditions.”Reports have indicated that the government is currently funding eight projects for digital vaccine passports.The government has been giving mixed signals on the issue for months, with Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi and Cabinet Minister Michael Gove both denying that the government would introduce health passes within the country.There have been increasing signals that the European Union will also introduce such a scheme, following the announcements from countries such as Denmark and Greece that they will be implementing vaccine passports.Vaccine Passports Could be Used in Supermarkets Suggests UK Foreign Secretary https://t.co/I6BWrbvLZd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthImmigrationLondon / EuropeBig Brother WatchBoris JohnsoncoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineCOVID-19Michael GoveUnited Kingdomvaccine passportVaccine Passportsvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

765,"A statue depicting the severed head of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on a pike has been displayed in the town centre of her childhood home by a left-wing Welsh artist.Mark Robla, a 34-year-old sculptor from Grantham in Lincolnshire installed the decapitated Thatcher on the plinth which will be the resting place of the official bronze statue of the Iron Lady, a £400K project which has been delayed because of the Chinese coronavirus.Speaking to the local paper The Grantham Journal, Mr Robla said: “I saved the council £400k and displayed my new piece.“I paid about £5 for the chair and took it apart. There were two metal poles inside which I made into a pike and the base of the chair helps balance the sculpture. It took about four months to complete and with materials, it cost about £100 in total.”“It depicts Margret Thatcher’s head stuck onto a pike made from an office chair, standing at 5ft 3in on the 10ft plinth while still clasping her iconic handbag at the base, all carved completely from plaster,” he said.The artist claimed that dislike of the Thatcher came as a result of being Welsh, saying: “Mines closed down and she was never a positive figure.”A post shared by MarkRobla (@markrobla)Robla said that he did not feel that placing his depiction of Thatcher on public property broke any law, explaining that he has “done this sort of thing before”.“I was there at 4 am in a hi-vis vest. I did not break in or damage the plinth,” he said, adding: “Location of a sculpture is one of the most important things and my sculpture would not have the same impact unless it was placed on the same plinth where the bronze statue will be placed.”Baroness Thatcher became Britain’s first female prime minister in 1979, serving in the role until 1990. Closely paired with her counterpart in the United States, Ronald Reagan, she was dubbed the ‘Iron Lady’ by the Soviet Union for her strident anti-communist stance and tough leadership style.Thatcher led the country to victory during the Falklands War in 1982 and successfully brought down inflation after years of economic devastation caused by the crippling socialist policies of the Labour Party in the 1970s.

Whilst there has been uncertainty generated by Brexit and the resulting political environment, its underlying fundamentals remain attractive to investors.”“With an economy that continues to attract multi-national companies and highly skilled talent, a high quantity of green spaces, access to clean and reliable water, as well as reliable energy and dependable public transport, London has retained its popularity with investors,” Machin added.On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson predicted that London and the other “great cities” in the UK will bounce back once the coronavirus restrictions are finally lifted.Mr Johnson said that while people have accustomed to working remotely, they are at the same time in desperate need of human reaction, saying: “I think that London – our great cities – will be full of buzz, and life and excitement again, provided people have confidence about coming back.”The latest batch of good economic news flies in the face of the pre-referendum dire warnings laid out by the Remainer ‘Project Fear’ scare campaign, which sought frighten Britons into voting to stay in the EU.

Mr Biden, who rented office space in the exclusive modernist building starting in February of 2017, is said to have allowed guests to circumvent security to the building after office hours.The allegations come as part of a series of emails obtained by Swedish media of a real estate representative for the building discussing the matter with Mr Biden himself, best-selling Swedish newspaper Expressen reports.“It has again come to my attention that it appears that visitors have gained access to number 507 through the northern entrance after office hours – as we have 24/7 video surveillance throughout the building.

The report notes there are around a dozen women involved in the protest.“In audio messages to their relatives, these women explained that they could no longer bear to watch their children suffer, wanted to ‘take responsibility’ and be tried in France for what they did,” the lawyers said.Mother of ISIS Defector Demands French Govt Send Cash to Them in Syria https://t.co/hLABU2r1eL— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 17, 2020The women are among around 80 females who left Europe to join the Islamic State terror group in the Middle East and currently reside in prison camps run by Kurdish forces in Syria, along with around 300 children.While France has repatriated ten Islamic State children from camps last year in June and another seven children this year in January for a total of 35 children so far, the country has been far more reluctant to repatriate adults.In October of last year, the mother of one female Islamic State member living in the al-Hol camp demanded the French government send her daughter cash or allow the family to send the woman cash.“While the state is currently choosing not to organise the repatriation of its nationals, it is responsible for providing material and financial assistance to the latter or at the very least to allow their families to do so,” the mother’s lawyers said.Other European countries, such as Sweden, have also been hesitant to allow jihadists to return.In January of last year, Somalian President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed made an offer to Sweden to take in some of the Islamic State members as around half of the Swedish women in the al-Hol camp are from a Somalian background.Perhaps the highest-profile single ISIS bride is Sahmima Begum, who left the United Kingdom as a teenager to get married in the Islamic State. The woman was later rediscovered living in a refugee camp by British television crews, and her unvarnished interviews about life in the Islamic State shocked Britain.Opposition to her returning to the UK grew after she casually described seeing her first severed head, explaining the decapitation victim deserved it because they were an enemy of Islam.

770,"At least ten former staff members are ready to come forward as claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex bullied and “humiliated” aides are probed.Allegations that Meghan, the former Suits starlet and wife of Prince Harry, inflicted “emotional cruelty and manipulation” on staff are being investigated by Buckingham Palace, after a former aide revealed she had been the subject of a bullying complaint and accused her of driving a number of people out of their jobs.“A group of people are queuing up to be involved. They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face.

The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
771,"A government minister redecorating his home study would seem like a non-event in normal times, but the act takes on special importance when you mix in the former landlord of a historic English inn, allegations of dodgy contracts, and a cool £30 million of taxpayer’s money.Controversial UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock appears to have removed from his study wall a photograph of his favourite local pub – which till recently featured prominently in the background when he gave TV interviews.Great spot from @ElspethElspeth Overnight “the photo of @MattHancock mate's pub, the Cock Inn, has been taken off the wall behind him”The publican, Alex Bourne’s contract to produce millions of vials for NHS Covid tests now under investigation by the UK’s medical regulator. https://t.co/q8us0k5Fh7 pic.twitter.com/yNct7zGgMn— Stefan Simanowitz (@StefSimanowitz) February 23, 2021A picture of the pub — The Cock Inn — was visible when Hancock gave media interviews on Sunday but had mysteriously vanished by Monday.Gosh, what possible reason could Hancock have had for this sudden change of heart towards his local and its erstwhile landlord Alex Bourne?Might it have anything to do with a burgeoning scandal involving a £30 million Covid contract awarded to the Bourne after he had sent a WhatsApp in March last year to Hancock’s mobile saying: ‘Hello, it’s Alex Bourne from Thurlow’?It was among £18 billion worth of Covid contracts handed out by senior ministers of Boris Johnson’s Conservative government, a significant chunk going to friends and acquaintances, in what has become known as the ‘Cash for Cronies’ scandal.Last week a High Court judge ruled that Health Secretary Hancock had acted ‘unlawfully’ in failing to publish the details of these contracts within the 30-day period required by law.But up to now, Hancock has faced no consequences for his dubious behaviour, other than public embarrassment.Interviewed on Sky News on Tuesday, Health Secretary Hancock insisted he had done nothing wrong and that he would do it all over again if he had to.According to the Mail:‘We accepted in full that these things were published a fortnight late. That isn’t in dispute,’ [Hancock] said.‘We argued the public interest defence – it’s in the national interest that we did what we did.’‘Sure, if we weren’t able to put the paperwork in on time – in normal times of course we’d put the paperwork in on time.‘But in the middle of a global pandemic you don’t.‘You can ask me as many questions as you like, you’re not going to change my view.‘And if I had my time again, absolutely I would do exactly the same thing, exactly the same thing, even if it led to this conversation.But this doesn’t go very to explaining one of the biggest mysteries surrounding the £30 million contract: what possible reason could Hancock have had for handing such a contract to a publican mate who, however excellent his beer or lavish his hospitality, had no experience of making medical supplies.According to the Mail:[Bourne’s] company, Hinpack, which was originally a packaging manufacturer, won around £30million in work to supply a distributor contracted by the NHS with two million test tubes a week, as well as around 500,000 plastic funnels for test samples.However the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed at the weekend it has launched a probe into Mr Bourne’s company – which had no previous experience of making medical supplies prior to the pandemic.One possible explanation for Hancock’s extreme generosity towards the publican is that he has so very few friends he treats those he does have unusually well.It cannot possibly be a case of corruption or jobs for the boys, though, because Hancock has publicly denied any wrongdoing.The Mail reports:Asked about the deals won by Mr Bourne on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning Mr Hancock said he ‘didn’t have anything to do with that contract’, despite claims by the ex-landlord that it came about after exchanging a personal WhatsApp message with the Health Secretary .‘This has all been looked into in great detail, it’s only because of the transparency that I support that we can ask questions about these contracts,’ Mr Hancock added.‘The implication of your question about the specific one that you raised is that people should be barred from taking contracts if they know anybody involved. That would be ridiculous.Ridiculous indeed. So ridiculous that we can all perfectly well appreciate why Hancock would have taken the offending pub photo down and replaced it with something less controversial – possibly, it has been suggested, Hancock’s cycling proficiency certificate.After all, which of us hasn’t at some time or another found ourselves wondering where to spend £30 million of public money on PPE contracts and then realised in a sudden lightbulb moment: “I know.

772,"Ukraine has filed a case with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) accusing Russia of the “targeted assassinations” of its political opponents “in Russia and on the territory of other state” and of hiding its lethal activities, a Tuesday press release from the ECHR revealed.The government in Kyiv insists that Moscow’s alleged authorization of assassinations against its political opponents “outside a situation of armed conflict,” which occur both in Russia and in other countries — including Council of Europe member states — violates Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the “right to life.”The Russian Federation is a signatory to the convention.Ukraine further alleges that Russia has an “administrative practice” of not investigating the alleged assassinations and of “deliberately mounting cover-up operations aimed at frustrating efforts to find the persons responsible.”Europeiska Pravda, a Ukrainian outlet, said the case includes the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, according to the Agence France-Presse (AFP). Navalny, an outspoken proponent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, fell ill on a flight to Moscow last year and has since accused Putin of ordering his death.The ECHR press release did not, however, specify any of the alleged assassinations related to the Ukrainian filing.Ukraine’s filing marks its ninth case against Russia in the ECHR, according to Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty (RFERL).The ECHR release noted that, including the assassination case, the court has four pending Ukrainian-backed suits against Russia. Among them is a case involving the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, which occurred in July 2014. Another involves alleged Russian convention violations in Crimea and a third addresses the Russian seizure of three Ukrainian naval vessels in the Kerch Strait in 2018.Russia and Ukraine have been at war since Russian rebels, which Kyiv contests are sanctioned by Moscow, launched attacks on the Ukrainian government, declaring themselves sovereign states. Russia, backed by these rebels, invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was the historical seat of the medieval Kievan Rus and later part of a greater Russian state from 1667-1991, with brief interludes during the First and Second World Wars. Ethnic Russians, mostly concentrated in the country’s eastern half, remain Ukraine’s largest minority group, according to Brittanica, though lingering active territorial disputes with Moscow and the ongoing Donbass conflict make an exact figure difficult to calculate.London / EuropeNational SecurityPoliticsRussiaUkraine.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

775,"A police force in Merseyside, England was forced to apologise after officers paraded around a local car park with a van emblazoned with an electronic billboard that read “Being Offensive is an Offence” during a so-called “hate crime awareness event”.On Saturday, the Twitter account for the police force in Wirral posted images of the officers in a supermarket parking lot, saying: “lots of positive discussion was had with the essential shoppers and together we will defeat hate in our community.”The force was widely mocked for the post, as many pointed out that being offensive is not actually a crime under British law, but for most campaigning and leafletting is — due to coronavirus lockdown laws — ultimately forcing the police to delete the tweet and issue a correction.In response to the initial post, Silkie Carlo, the director of the civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch said: “I would like to report a crime. This is a demonstration and you keep telling us they’re banned. You won’t let electoral candidates and the public, or even me and my mum, have ‘lots of positive discussion’ and I’m afraid these rules are universal.”Brexit leader Nigel Farage quipped: “Are there no problems with gun or knife crime in Merseyside then?”London Assembly Member Peter Whittle wrote: “Here are the Thought Police.

Hate crime can come in various guises that can include assault, criminal damage, verbal and written online abuse.”Marking what is termed in Britain LGBT+ History Month, the Merseyside Police Force said on its website: “It’s important everyone understands the legacy of discrimination and abuse faced by the LGTB+ community and learns from history, to make sure we do better today.”“Throughout the month, we will be sharing stories from some of our LGBT+ network members and allies to support learning and to inspire and empower others,” the force added.The campaign against so-called hate speech in Britain has seen police record some 120,000 ‘non-crime hate incidents‘ in criminal databases, meaning that despite committing no actual offence it will still visible on a person’s criminal background check.Police forces have also previously called upon the British public to snitch on their fellow citizens for “things like offensive or insulting comments, online, in person or in writing”.The Reclaim Party, launched by free speech advocate and prominent British actor Laurence Fox, called on the Home Office to investigate the police force for the sign.“Offensive: causing someone to feel resentful, upset, or annoyed,” the party wrote on social media, going on to quote George Orwell, who said: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people things they do not want to hear”.As Poland Legislates to Guarantee Free Speech, UK Cracks Down on ‘Hate Speech’ Instead https://t.co/QNjO8piN2V— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 2, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaCrimeLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBig Brother WatchBritish policeHate Crimehate speechLaurence FoxLGBTLGBT agendaLGBT policeMerseyside PoliceNigel Faragepeter whittleReclaim PartyUK policeUnited KingdomWoke Culture.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
776,"The migrant crisis once again hit British shores this week, as a stretch of warmer weather allowed a flurry of boats full of illegal aliens to set sail from France, with over one hundred migrants reaching the UK in the past two days.On Monday, over 170 boat migrants in attempted to cross the English Channel, 49 of whom were brought ashore by the British Border Force at the Port of Dover.An additional 77 migrants in four separate boats were taken ashore on Tuesday, with French authorities reporting zero interceptions, according to BBC reporter Simon Jones.Despite the British taxpayer forking over an additional £28 million to the French to shut down the migrant routes, the latest crossings mean that over 300 illegals have already landed in the UK this year, the Daily Mail reported.The migrant boats were said to have begun in the early hours of Monday morning, crossing under cover of darkness. However, the paper reported that the migrants were once again transported across the Channel by French authorities who met UK border officials halfway through the Channel.The Daily Telegraph said that from the beginning of the year attempted crossings had risen by over 50 per cent over the same time period last year, from 630 to 950. The paper did note that border authorities in France and Britain managed to block 70 per cent of the attempts, up from 55 per cent last year.On Tuesday morning, Brexit leader Nigel Farage reported that there was “madness in the Channel again today,” going on to claim “an illegal vessel landed at Walmer, Kent and 21 people are now on the run being hunted by the police.”This is believed to be footage of the beach landing in Kent this morning.

777,"Britain’s Bank of England is in the process of purging former governors and directors from its art collection for “inexcusable connections” to the historic slave trade, according to reports.“As an institution, the Bank of England was never itself directly involved in the slave trade,” the central bank claimed in a 2020 statement, but it added that it was “aware of some inexcusable connections involving former governors and directors and apologises for them”.Anti-iconoclast campaigners such as Robert Poll of the Save Our Statues campaign have protested that such people “acted within the accepted norms of their time”, but the Bank has vowed that “none with any such involvement in the slave trade [will] remain on display anywhere in the bank”.University College London has identified 25 such governors and directors in its so-called Legacies of British Slave Ownership project, and The Art Newspaper reports that the Bank of England is currently in the process of cleansing them, despite the British government having made it clear that its policy is that public institutions should “retain and explain” historic memorials.Sadiq Khan Claims Statue DEFENDERS Are the Ones 'Trying to Engineer a Culture War' https://t.co/iiUBtWpbWw— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 20, 2021With slavery having been an accepted institution in much of the world, including Africa, until British abolitionists and the British state began the process of stamping it out at home and abroad in the 19th century, it is not hard to find that high-profile merchants often had slavery links.Sometimes these links are less obvious, coming via holding shares in state-backed ventures like the Royal African Company, which made slavery part of their business, or simply inheriting money from family members who made part of their fortune from Caribbean enterprises which used slave labour, for example — but such links have been enough to narrowly define some formerly esteemed figures as slave traders in the post-BLM era.Police chief who did nothing as Black Lives Matter ripped down a historic statue gets a medal in Boris Johnson's New Year Honours (but @Nigel_Farage gets nothing) https://t.co/eWc1UP3fXH— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 31, 2020The Bank of England is moving against its own former governors and directors as Jesus College, Cambridge, is attempting to excise a stone funeral monument to one its great benefactors, Tobias Rustat, from the chapel where it currently sits and move it in a disused wine cellar.Rustat, who funded scholarships for the orphans of Anglican clergymen, was involved in the aforementioned Royal African Company — established by King Charles II — so his philanthropy is no longer considered worth honouring by the college, which asserts that his memorial “is incompatible with the chapel as an inclusive community” and asked the Church of England for permission to get rid of it.Rustat’s descendants have protested the move, however, telling The Times that they regard him “as a distinguished ancestor” who “made his money in the court of Charles II.”“It’s clear that the bulk of his wealth came from things [that were] nothing to do with slavery, so the money that was given to Jesus College clearly has nothing to do with slavery,” they complained.Nelson Statue Vandal Walks Free After Judge Lets Him Off With Conditional Discharge https://t.co/kDBnS77t1X— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 18, 2020London / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeBank of EnglandBritainBritish HistoryCentral BankingCentral BanksCulture Warculture warsdiversityHeritageHistoryIconoclasmIdentity PoliticsMulticulturalismSJWssocial justice warriorsstatuesUnited KingdomWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
778,"Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán believes it is the “calling” of Europe’s conservative former Soviet satellite states to bring their “uncompromising” tradition of anti-communism into the “common store” of Western values.Orbán issued the calling to mark the 30th anniversary of the formation of the Visegrád alliance of socially conservative countries in Central Europe — not Eastern Europe, its residents stress, as they are in fact at the continent’s geographical centre between Western Europe and the nations of the former Soviet Union.The “traditional mission” of the Visegrád countries — namely Hungary, Poland, Czechia, and Slovakia — was “meaningless for as long as Soviet troops were stationed in our countries”, wrote Orbán in an article for Magyar Nemzet, a translation of which has been by Breitbart London.“[O]ur horizons were restricted and our strength diverted by the task of freeing ourselves of our own communists and – after the bayonets of the occupiers had disappeared – consigning them to where they belonged: as far as possible from governmental power, to schoolbook compendiums of historical crimes with which we can educate our children and grandchildren, and show them what comes from trying to build a future without the embrace of national ideals and Christian teachings,” he explained.Today, however, freed from the Soviet yoke and on a path to prosperity after struggling out of the economic wreckage of the old Eastern Bloc’s collapse, Orbán is turning a critical eye on North America and the Western European countries, many of which have a hand in Central Europe’s governance via the European Union.On the hard-hitting realisations that came to Central Europe after the migrant crisis, Orbán wrote, it had become clear that Western Europe was now moving in a wholly new and damaging direction: “redefining the essence of Europe, and… steadily working on the implementation of their programme. ”“They did not see Europe’s mission as repelling external attacks against Christianity, or as preserving our internal diversity. Their new European mission had become complete openness: the elimination of borders – or at most their existence as only a temporary, necessary evil; gender roles and family models that can be changed at will; and policy that sees the obligation to maintain our cultural heritage as a task that should rather be left to museologists,” he lamented.Hungarian PM: ‘The Spirit of Marx, Lenin, and the Re-Education Camps’ Lives on in the EU  https://t.co/nOmkbrK055— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 22, 2018“In this situation in Europe, we Hungarians can clearly see the essence of our European calling,” wrote Orbán, noting that the hyper-diversity and state-sponsored multiculturalism backed by many of the European Union’s leaders is something they wish to force on the entire bloc, including conservative-minded countries.“It is to bring the uncompromising anti-communist tradition into the common store of European values. It is to place the crimes and lessons of international socialism alongside the crimes and lessons of national socialism,” declared the former anti-communist activist, who was famously pictured being detained by communist-era police with a club across his throat as a young man.“Not to defend oneself is de facto surrender, and its consequence will be complete civilisational transformation – as experienced at close quarters by nations in the Balkan neighbourhood on Europe’s southern and eastern perimeter,” he added, perhaps referring to regions such as Eastern Thrace and Istanbul — formerly Constantinople — where the last vestiges of the old Byzantine Greek culture and people are on the verge of extinction.“[I]t is certain that our nations fully appreciate the responsibility they bear for the future of Europe: to defend it against external attacks and to defend it from internal imperial designs, maintaining the sovereignty of our homelands and nations,” Orbán vowed.EU Chief Jean-Claude Juncker Defies Protests to Deliver Heartfelt Defence of Karl Marx https://t.co/LXTrmbYpGX— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 5, 2018ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticscold warcommunismcommunistsConservativismCultural MarxismCzech RepublicCzechiadiversityEUEurope Migrant CrisisEuropean UnionglobalismHungaryMass MigrationMigrant CrisisNational ConservativismOpen BordersPolandSlovakiaSocial CohesionSoviet UnionThe WestUSSRV4Viktor OrbánVisegradWestern CivilisationWestern CivilizationWestern valuesWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
779,"BERLIN (AP) – A German man suspected in three heists against money transporters, including one at Cologne-Bonn airport, was arrested in the Netherlands on Tuesday, German investigators said.The 60-year-old, whose name wasn’t released, is alleged to have participated in the robberies in Cologne in 2018 and at the airport and in Frankfurt in 2019.Two guards were wounded in the latter attacks, and the suspect is accused of using a machine gun in the airport robbery, prosecutors and police in Cologne said in a statement.In all three cases, the assailants fled in cars stolen in the Netherlands, set fire to them near the crime scene and continued in a second car, they said. Investigators were able to identify a car that they allegedly used to flee back across the border.Prosecutors and police said their investigation did not confirm media speculation that former members of the far-left Red Army Faction group may have been involved in the robberies.They said they already have sought the extradition of the suspect, who was detained on a European arrest warrant.CrimeLondon / EuropeGermanyNetherlandsRed Army FactionTheft.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
780,"A report on antisemitism in schools in the Swedish multicultural city of Malmo has made the claim that much of the hatred toward Jewish students comes from students of Arab and Middle Eastern backgrounds.The February report “Schoolyard racism, conspiracy theories and exclusion,” looked specifically at antisemitism and discrimination toward Jewish people in the city’s school system and found that issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict played a large role. Some Arab-background students, particularly those linked to Palestine, are said to even praise Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in the playground according to testimony from school staff.“It was Arabic students who had a passion for Hitler and I just assume and conclude that it comes from antisemitism. They had well recently learned about the Holocaust and got to the fact that Hitler was on their side in some way and that he was good in some way because he had killed so many Jews,” the school official said.According to a report from Nyheter Idag, some member of the school staff were also accused of naming antisemitic remarks and using antisemitic jargon.Claim: Multicultural Malmö a ‘No-Go Zone’ for Jews https://t.co/KgiFHbfQE0— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 26, 2019Mirjam Katzin, the author of the report, claimed that only 27 of the city’s 63 primary school principals actually sent the survey to their staff and the report even claimed that there were several schools in the city where Jews were simply not welcome.“Jews stay away from certain schools because they do not feel safe going to certain schools. There is a list of schools that are okay for Jews and not. Actually, all high schools are blacklisted except a few,” an unnamed student said.The report comes after some young Jewish people spoke out about antisemitism in Malmo in 2019, with teen Daniel Vaknine also claiming that many high schools in the city were not safe for Jewish students.“Uncertainty means that you cannot go to school with a visible Star of David because then there is a high risk of being threatened, or that someone follows you from the school or even being beaten,” he said.In that same year, the city’s Jewish congregation claimed Malmo was becoming a no-go area for Jews and that the number of Jews in the city had shrunk from 842 people in 1999 to just 387 members in 2019.Antisemitic Attacks on the Rise Across Sweden https://t.co/E0nUip7S7I— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 3, 2019EducationLondon / EuropeAntisemtismIsraeli-Palestinian conflictMalmoMigrantsSwedenSwedish schools.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
781,"Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage has hailed a successful public pressure campaign against Coca-Cola pushing training that urged staff to “be less white”.“‘Woke Capitalism’ is what it’s known as when big companies have somebody ‘right on’ in the HR department who thinks they need to do this for popularity,” the Brexit champion said of the training, which included such illuminating slides as “To be less white is to: be less oppressive, be less arrogant, be less certain, be less defensive, be less ignorant, be more humble, listen, believe, break with apathy, break with white solidarity.”The fizzy drinks giant has now confirmed it will be excising this “absolutely crackpot idea”, as Farage put it, from its training — a further climbdown from its earlier equivocal statement on the scandal, which said only that the seminar was not “a focus” of its “curriculum”.“[T]hey’ve [now] dropped this dreadful idea of telling people to be less white, and telling people who are white to be utterly ashamed of who they are and what they stand for, and this is a big victory,” the former MEP exulted, saying the episode showed the power of ordinary people following non-mainstream news sources to effect change when they speak out.Staff were told that “To be less white is to: be less oppressive, be less arrogant, be less certain, be less defensive, be less ignorant, be more humble, listen, believe, break with apathy, break with white solidarity.” https://t.co/Mx5l1NlVzu— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 22, 2021Mr Farage was not content to rest on his laurels, however, highlighting the issue of illegal boat crossings by migrants in the English Channel, which he has striven to emphasise in the national conversation, and how more work needs to be done to force action on the crisis.“Well it was all very bullish [on this issue] from Priti Patel and Chris Philp [after Brexit] but none of it ever matches reality, because [on Tuesday] morning a boat landed on a beach… and 21 migrants got off the boat and ran off into the Kent countryside,” he said.“Whatever Chris Philp said, so far this year, the numbers that are coming are even bigger than last year,” he stressed.“So we’ve won on Coca-Cola, but to stop the massive cost of people coming into Britain illegally, the vast majority of whom would never ever qualify to be refugees, let alone what the security risk is of people who we’ve got no idea who they are coming into and being allowed to stay in our country… we haven’t won this won yet,” he said, urging supporters to “go on putting pressure for change”.Madness in the Channel: Over 100 Illegal Migrants Brought Ashore in Two Days https://t.co/pplQkSkAPc— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSocial Justiceanti-white racismBlack Lives MatterBLMBoat MigrantsBritainChannel MigrantsCoca ColaCokeCommunity CohesionCritical Race TheorydiscriminationdiversityEurope Migrant CrisisIconoclasmIdentity PoliticsIllegal Aliensillegal immigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant CrisisMigrantsMulticulturalismNigel FaragePositive DiscriminationracismReform UKreverse racismSJWsSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorsstatuesUnited Kingdomwhite privilegeWhitenessWokeWoke CapitalWoke CapitalismWoke CorporationswokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

783,"The United Kingdom may follow the lead of Australia and Canada in forcing Facebook to pay news publishers for hosting their content, government officials have suggested.A Downing Street spokesman said that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was “obviously concerned” about Facebook’s decision to censor news content on its platform in Australia, and may introduce legislation to take on Big Tech platforms “later this year”.“We’re obviously concerned about access to news being restricted in Australia. As we always have done, we will be robust in defending free speech and journalism. We’re setting up a unit to promote competition in digital markets and ensure major tech companies cannot exploit dominant market positions,” the spokesman told The Times.In an interview with Times Radio, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that Secretary for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Oliver Dowden, was looking “very closely” at crafting legislation to regulate Silicon Valley companies in the UK.“I have very strong views on this,” Hancock said, adding: “All I can say is that I’m a great admirer of Australia and Canada… I think this is a very important matter and I’ve got no doubt the culture secretary will be looking at it very closely.”Last year, Australia became the first country in the world to announce its intentions to force companies like Facebook and Google to pay news publishers royalties for hosting content on their websites.In response to the proposed legislation, Facebook announced that with a “heavy heart” it would be censoring Australian users from viewing or sharing news articles within the country and blocking Australian publishers from posting content on the site.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: “These actions will only confirm the concerns that an increasing number of countries are expressing about the behaviour of Big Tech companies who think they are bigger than governments and that the rules should not apply to them.”Facebook backed down from its position on Tuesday, announcing that it would be lifting the censorship regime in Australia in “the coming days”, Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.Australia has no intention of backing down against Facebook as a host of world leaders cheer on PM Scott Morrison. Me via @BreitbartNews https://t.co/7dMdxMx5KU— Simon Kent (@sunsimonkent) February 19, 2021Canada said last week that it would be crafting similar legislation to that in Australia and the European Union has proposed a so-called “link tax” for Silicon Valley giants.A British government source told The Times that ministers are considering “pro-competition reforms,” saying: “We are certainly not ruling out Australian-style legislation to fix the imbalance in the relationship between big tech companies and news organisations. However, clearly, there is a process that needs to be gone through and that is why we are consulting.”Facebook has argued that the lack of regulation in the UK allows it to strike individual deals with publishers, with a spokesman pointing to the deals struck in January with mainstream media outlets such as The Guardian, Financial Times, the Daily Mail, amongst others, which will see Facebook pay “tens of millions” to host content on its Facebook News service.Facebook said during its ban of news in Australia that it will only make such investments in countries that have the “right rules” in place, in a potential shot across the bow to any country attempting to follow Australia’s lead and take on Big Tech.In the UK, Google and Facebook account for some 80 per cent of all digital advertising as of 2019, with Facebook raking in £1.65 billion in revenues in Britain, upon which they paid £28.5 million in taxes.Facebook Admits Banning Users for Saying They Are ‘Proud to Be English’ https://t.co/Ih8JkQoSlP— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 27, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsTechAustraliaBig TechBig Tech RegulationBoris JohnsonCanadaFacebookGoogleMasters of the UniverseMatt HancockOliver DowdenSilicon ValleyUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
784,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform.

785,"People in the United Kingdom live under one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, an Oxford observatory has found, but this appears to have had a questionable impact on health outcomes for the country, which has one of the highest known coronavirus fatality rates worldwide.The global ranking of ‘government stringency’ in responding to the coronavirus, compiled daily by the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, makes the United Kingdom out as the strictest lockdown nation in the Western world, scoring 86 out of a possible 100. Only Eritrea, Venezuela, and Lebanon score higher globally.The rating, which weighs up new public health restrictions — such as stay-at-home-orders, mask mandates, and school closures — but does not consider the effectiveness with which the rules are enforced, also sees other European nations score highly. Following the United Kingdom’s fourth-place ranking globally is the Republic of Ireland on 85 points out of 100, Germany at 83, Italy at 82, and Spain at 71.The United States is down the rankings, indicating a higher level of freedom, at 68 out of 100 points.The Blavatnik team puts Britain’s extremely high rating down on the fact it has closed schools, something even the harshest locked-down European nations have tried to avoid, reports the Daily Telegraph in their roundup of the research. The country is also under a blanket stay-at-home order, with the legal requirement to not go outside remaining in place at least until the end of March, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson noted this week.Chief Eurocrat Admits Brexit Britain Is Vaccine ‘Speedboat’ Compared to EU https://t.co/QWdUL4oQbo— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2021Lockdowns aren’t the only pandemic response that the United Kingdom has approached with an enthusiasm hardly seen elsewhere in the world. Having moved quickly to contribute to the development of vaccines and order doses of them, Britain has massively outpaced its European neighbours on inoculations. Indeed, by Tuesday the British government had given 27 per cent of residents a first coronavirus dose, whereas the European Union average was just six per cent.While the British government may be able to boast it has stopped at no expense or restriction on liberty in service of its people against coronavirus, in the key areas where it counts questions may one day be raised over the extent to which these measures actually worked. Relying on official figures, at least, the United Kingdom has one of the highest death rates per capita in the world at 1,781 per million head of population.Only a handful of countries worldwide can match that figure, but all of them are in Europe. Belgium, home to the EU capital of Brussels, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia come in over 1,800 deaths per million.The United States has had 1,512 deaths per million population.UK Government Didn’t Listen to Its Own Advice and Failed to Prepare for Coronavirus: Report https://t.co/Js9bBozDc1— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 24, 2020HealthLondon / EuropeBoris JohnsoncoronavirusEuropean UnionMatt HancockUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
786,"The Member of Parliament for the Port of Dover has called for illegal migrants to be put on the same quarantine “red list” as legitimate travellers, including British citizens, entering the United Kingdom from high-risk countries.Despite having refused to put controls on travel from coronavirus epicentres such as Italy, Iran, South Korea, China, and even Wuhan itself in the early stages of the pandemic, the Boris Johnson administration has now created a ‘red list’ of some 33 countries from which travel is banned, except for British citizens and residents, who are required to quarantine in hotels upon return.Backbench MPs are now questioning why this regime is not applied to illegal migrants, many of whom arrive on packed people-smuggler boats and may be from, or have been in contact with people from red list countries. Coronavirus infection rates in northern France are 15 higher than in Dover.“I would like to see a compulsory period of quarantine in order to reduce the transmission risk when the countries of origin cannot be properly identified and confirmed,” said Natalie Elphicke MP, whose constituency was for many years ground zero for illegal migration into the United Kingdom, and remains a major drop-off point for the British authorities after they collect boat migrants at sea and bring them the rest of the way to England instead of taking them back to France, in comments reported by the Telegraph.“It should be similar to the quarantine imposed on people returning from high-risk countries. The same approach should be applied to people who are arriving illegally and the assumption should be that they may have travelled through a higher-risk country.”Madness in the Channel: Over 100 Illegal Migrants Brought Ashore in Two Days https://t.co/pplQkSkAPc— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2021“The Home Office needs to apply at least the same quarantine restrictions as they do for people from ‘red list’ countries, not least because of the infection rate in northern France,” agreed Tim Loughton, a fellow Conservative MP and former government minister who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee.“That’s not happening. They have been sending them to Brooke House [an immigration centre near London Gatwick airport] as well, which is not geared up to deal with boat migrants. Others have been at liberty to wander as they wish. Absolutely, they need to be subject to the same regime.”Unlike illegal migrants, who are housed in hotels and in some cases accommodation based at former Army barracks at the British public’s expense, legitimate travellers from red list countries are required to pay for the hotel rooms where they are forcibly quarantined themselves.‘Totally Unacceptable’ – Illegal Migrants Getting Vaccines Before At-Risk Brits at 4-Star Hotel https://t.co/rCPhPXD1aO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2021ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsasylum seekersBoat MigrantsBoris JohnsonBritainChannel CrisisConservative PartycoronavirusCOVID-19English ChannelEurope Migrant Crisishome officeIllegal AliensIllegal Immigrantsillegal immigrationlockdownlockdownsMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant CrisisMigrant HotelsMigrantsNatalie Elphickepandemicpriti patelquarantineTim LoughtonToriesTory partytravel bantravel bansUnited KingdomWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
787,"UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab is calling on U.N. investigators to insist on urgent access to Uyghur camps in Xinjiang to ascertain the level of human rights abuses taking place in the Chinese province.Mr. Raab said this week that Uyghur abuses have reached an “industrial scale,” noting that he plans to press the UN human rights council on Monday to address rights violations in China, Myanmar, Belarus and Russia, urging it to launch an independent investigation into Xinjiang internment camps.“The situation in Xinjiang is beyond the pale,” the foreign secretary plans to say, according to the Financial Times. “The reported abuses — which include torture, forced labour and forced sterilisation of women — are extreme and they are extensive. They are taking place on an industrial scale.”On February 2, the BBC released a chilling report on the systematic rape, sexual abuse, and torture in China’s “re-education” camps for Uyghurs in the Xinjiang autonomous region.China and Hong Kong responded by banning broadcasts of BBC World Service and BBC News Weekly for a year, with China’s state-run Global Times calling the British broadcaster a “rumor mill” that threatens China’s “national security.”China’s National Radio and Television Administration issued a statement that accused the BBC of infringing “the principles of truthfulness and impartiality in journalism” in its report and of undermining Chinese national interests and the unity of the “Chinese people.”“China’s decision to ban BBC World News in mainland China is an unacceptable curtailing of media freedom,” Dominic Raab said in a statement. “China has some of the most severe restrictions on media and Internet freedoms across the globe and this latest step will only damage China’s reputation in the eyes of the world.”Following last year’s imposition of the draconian national security law in Hong Kong, the British government suspended trade talks with China. The UK has also banned Chinese tech giant Huawei from the country’s 5G networks because of security concerns.For its part, the United States has declared China’s treatment of its Muslim minority Uyghur population to constitute genocide and crimes against humanity.On the very last day in office, the Trump administration said that the People’s Republic of China has systematically discriminated against and surveilled Uyghurs as part of a project to eradicate them.“I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by the Chinese party-state,” said former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement. “The governing authorities of the second-most economically, militarily and politically powerful country on earth have made clear that they are engaged in the forced assimilation and eventual erasure of a vulnerable ethnic and religious minority group, even as they simultaneously assert their country as a global leader.”Follow @tdwilliamsromeAsiaLondon / EuropeNational SecurityChinaChinese Communist Party (CCP)Dominic RaabGenocideUighursUnited KingdomXi JinpingXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
788,"The last restrictions on public gatherings and businesses won’t be repealed until June at the earliest, but the Prime Minister has made clear his review dates are not promises and remain in his gift depending on how the government perceives coronavirus levels.Britons will not see any relaxations on the government-imposed lockdown until early March at the very earliest, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said, noting the dates on his new roadmap remain completely flexible and are subject to ‘tests’ the government will apply.Even if the first date is reached without further delay, the present stay-at-home orders in place will only give way days shy of a full year since the first corona lockdown began in March 2020. The country will certainly be in something resembling full lockdown on the first anniversary of lockdowns beginning, therefore, with the best-case scenario only foreseeing one person being allowed to meet one other person in an outdoor place like a park, with social spaces like pubs and beer gardens still firmly closed.Indeed, Johnson said people would be “legally required to stay at home” until March 29th.The four tests which must be met before we can move through each step of the COVID-19 roadmap.Decisions at each step will be made on the latest data and we will be cautious so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far.➡️https://t.co/uIi9lFqgJw pic.twitter.com/xDMxmKKgVH— UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) February 22, 2021Explaining the government’s plan for ending lockdown, the Prime Minister excused the extremely slow speed at which the year-long on-off shutdown of the nation would end, explaining that while he was being cautious, it was because he wanted the return to freedom to be irreversible.Under the terms of the plan, there will be four dates in the future, each at least five weeks apart — to show the government whether the previous release had worked or not, Mr Johnson explained — starting on March 8th. Each of these dates would be subject to four tests to determine whether the government believed it would be appropriate to give the public another slice of their lives back, with any delay clearly pushing all remaining dates backwards according to the five-week rule.The earliest possible day the lockdown could end, assuming no delays, would be June 21st, Mr Johnson said — but such delays have taken place before.Britons were told in April 2020, for example, that restrictions in place at the time were being extended for three weeks, and would not be lifted until “five tests” were met. Almost a year later, it is arguable whether lockdown was ever meaningfully lifted following that announcement, particularly in areas subject to harsh regional lockdowns between the various national lockdowns.Thanks to your sacrifices, social distancing is working. But if we stop now, we risk increasing the spread of #coronavirus.We’re extending the rules by at least three weeks, and will not change the rules until five tests are met ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/KJnDYFguLK— UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) April 16, 2020The Prime Minister’s statement was not short of caveats, in any case, even beyond warnings that he was following the data presented to him rather than committing to firm dates. Mr Johhson stated that despite the world-class vaccine rollout in Britain, “no vaccine can ever be 100 per cent effective… Covid like all viruses will mutate” and whether “it happens now or in nine months”, any relaxation of the rules would cause more deaths.On vaccines, Mr Johnson said the government was aiming to offer every adult in Britain a first dose by the end of July.There would be new intrusions into ‘normal’ life as the price for restrictions lifting too, Mr Johnson warned. Among them would be twice-weeky, presumably mandatory, testing for children returning to school. The normalising of constant, routine coronavirus testing may yet spread to other areas of life as the PM confirmed the state would continue to support the provision of free testing.Urging people to remain patient, Mr Johnson concluded his remarks by stating “the end really is in sight”, that Spring and Summer will be “incomparably different” to last year.It will be 3 months until we can have a drink in a pub. This is freedom at a snail’s pace.— Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 22, 2021Vocal lockdown-forever critic and Brexit leader Nigel Farage was quick to speak out against the “snail’s pace” of Mr Johnson’s lockdown plan. Referring to the speed at which ordinary human social activity was slated to return — pub beer gardens from April 12th, indoor pubs from May 17th, nightclubs from June 21st — Mr Farage said: “It will be 3 months until we can have a drink in a pub. This is freedom at a snail’s pace… How many restaurants will survive until 17 May? … Easter is cancelled.”Ross Clark, comment writer for the government-friendly Daily Telegraph, noted in response to the lockdown roadmap that while Britain was winning the “vaccination race”, it seemed likely the country would be the “last to reopen” in Europe. EconomyHealthLondon / EuropeBoris JohnsonBritaincoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownlockdownsNigel FaragepandemicUnited KingdomWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
789,"Brexit champion Nigel Farage has slammed Coca-Cola for allegedly requiring staff to take training urging them to “be less white”.Slides from the LinkedIn-based training originally circulated on social media after being shared by psychologist Karlyn Borysenko.One explains that “To be less white is to: be less oppressive, be less arrogant, be less certain, be less defensive, be less ignorant, be more humble, listen, believe, break with apathy, break with white solidarity.” Another simply urges the view: “Try to be less white.”Responding to the scandal on his YouTube channel, Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage lamented that he had thought progress was being made against the “Black Lives Matter madness”, but that the Coca-Cola revelations were another example of the corporate world having “lost its marbles” as a result of the movement.“So, to be less white means you’ll be less arrogant, less ignorant — I mean, the list goes on: ‘try to be less white’,” he said.“And the inference here is clear, isn’t it? That white is bad; white means supremacist; white means you look down your noses at everybody else; white means you are guilty!” he continued.“And this is what Coca-Cola is foisting upon their employees in the USA?” he asked, expressing his hope that it would not “cross the Atlantic”.🚨🚨🚨 BREAKING: Coca-Cola is forcing employees to complete online training telling them to ""try to be less white.""

I must become a better person; I must make sure I exhibit within myself no prejudice towards anybody.’ Or does it actually make white people really, really angry, and actually make them feel that society is now more divided than ever?”The former UKIP supremo suggested that the inheritors of Martin Luther King’s campaign for “justice, fairness, and equality” no longer want people to be judged purely on “character, honesty, integrity, intelligence — no, they want us all to be divided up into different groups, different groups based on race, gender, and sexuality”.“[W]hen we are confronted with this nonsense, when we are told we must atone for the past, we must confess our guilty simply because we’re white, or any other colour, or any other faith, we’ve just gotta say ‘enough is enough’,” he insisted.Statement from @CocaCola: https://t.co/Jzur7zuXFz pic.twitter.com/DBIpsj5706— Chris Pandolfo (@ChrisCPandolfo) February 20, 2021Coca-Cola, for its part, has been careful to avoid denying that the “try to be less white” presentation is a compulsory part of training for any of its staff, but it has claimed it is “not a focus of our company’s curriculum”.“Our Better Together global learning curriculum is part of a learning plan to help build an inclusive workplace. It is comprised of a number of short vignettes, each a few minutes long.

790,"Barbers, hairdressers, gyms, pubs, and restaurants are expected to remain restricted when Boris Johnson announces a loosening of the national lockdown regulations in England.With the United Kingdom having executed one of the most successful mass vaccination programmes globally, far outstripping the European Union, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a “cautious” rollback of the restrictions on citizens’ liberty on Monday afternoon.This will reportedly include the re-opening of English schools and permission for recreation in public spaces by up to two people — taking a picnic or a flask of tea in a public park, for example — from March 8th, as well as permission for care home residents to receive a single visitor with whom they can hold hands (but not hug).Restrictions will ease further, circumstances permitting, from March 28th, with outdoor gatherings of up to six people permitted, including in private gardens, and prohibitions against outdoor sports lifted.It is also thought that people will be allowed to travel beyond their own locality again, although such travel will not be recommended and spending the night away from home will not be allowed.Blair Tells Boris Not to Ditch Tier System After Lockdown https://t.co/AnvmvLMvB6— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 19, 2021The government minister with special responsibility for vaccination, Nadhim Zahawi, has described the lockdown relaxation “roadmap” as “steady as she goes”, with an emphasis on “outdoor versus indoor” activities and the “priority being children in schools”.“Second priority is obviously allowing two people on March 8th to meet outside for a coffee to address some of the issues around loneliness,” he added.For Britain’s battered hospitality industry, therefore, as well as other custom-facing service providers such as barbers and hairdressers, lockdown pain will continue for some time, with the likelihood being that they will remain shut until at least April.Business owners focused on these industries have suffered a great deal over the course of the pandemic as a result of the lockdown, with some finding their situation compounded by EU-created caps on allowable state assistance which remained in place despite Brexit — although the government is now considering getting rid of these.Lockdown easing will progress differently in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, as restrictions in the United Kingdom’s smaller Home Nations are largely the responsibility of their devolved governments — roughly equivalent to state governments in the United States.British should send vaccines to third world now, before their own population is fully vaccinated, says World Trade Org boss Okonjo-Iweala https://t.co/QlS9RYtV9i— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021EconomyLondon / EuropePoliticsBoris JohnsonBritaincoronavirusCOVID-19hospitalitylockdownlockdownspandemicPubsUnited KingdomWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

792,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage has warned that there is a “communist takeover” of large swaths of Britain’s private education sector, as an investigation has revealed that schools throughout the country have been bought out by firms connected to the Chinese government.There are currently 17 private schools in the United Kingdom owned by Chinese firms, nine of which are owned by senior members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).The schools are reportedly presenting a “whitewashed” view of China to their students, and one school has admitted that the goal of infiltrating the education system is to propagate China’s One Belt, One Road global initiative, an investigation from the Mail on Sunday revealed.Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage said that the British government “must wake up to the dangers and act quickly” warning that “the world is being taken over by stealth by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Under a neo-colonial project, President Xi Jinping hopes to achieve global economic domination via massive international investments.”“For example, three schools and a network of colleges are now owned by the Bright Scholar Group, run by Yang Huiyan, whose billionaire father is a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party. In essence, this is nothing less than a Communist takeover of part of Britain’s private education sector,” Farage said.“Meanwhile, there’s the role of the Confucius Institutes. Under the control of the Chinese government, its students are taught a grossly sanitised version of Chinese history and politics,” he added.BREAKINGChinese billionaires with direct links to the CCP are buying up British schools — and flooding the curriculum with their propaganda. This Communist takeover of our education system must be stopped. pic.twitter.com/3KsmUKIzev— Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 20, 2021The investigation found that since 2014, Chinese companies have taken advantage of financial difficulties facing boarding schools in order to scoop them up. Last year alone, three schools were bought out by Chinese firms.In 2017, the Wanda group, founded by Chinese prominent Chinese Communist Party member and billionaire Wang Jianlin, bought two private schools Bedstone College in Shropshire and Ipswich High School.Mr Farage noted that as a result of inflation, private schools in the United Kingdom have become only accessible to the rich, saying: “As a result, such schools – especially those with boarders – are reliant on Chinese students to help balance the books.”The communist infiltration extends beyond buying up schools, with 29 Confucius Institutes on British university campuses, and 148 Confucius classrooms present in schools.Both operations claim to offer education on the Chinese language and culture, yet are in fact branches of the Chinese Ministry of Education which reports directly to the Communist Party’s central propaganda department.Over a dozen British universities are reportedly under investigation by security services over their relationships with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which may have violated national security and human rights laws.  https://t.co/JPASmB4Fvn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021In Confucius classrooms, students are shown propaganda articles, including those showing tourists enjoying holidays in Xinjiang, the region home to the concentration camps in which Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities are interned in the millions. Another programme within the classrooms also displays a dancing virtual Xi Jinping which gives students a “sanitised view” of the history of the Chinese state.“These people are being taught that China is the future, they are literally being indoctrinated by the Chinese Communist Party,” Nigel Farage said, adding that they are not taught about the genocide in Xinjiang or the destruction of democracy in Hong Kong.Beyond silencing debate on sensitive issues for the Chinese government, such as the so-called “Three T’s” — Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square — Confucious Institutes have been accused of monitoring the activities of Chinese students studying abroad.One Chinese student reported: “The Confucius Institute, to me, functions like the closed circulation television and has the potential to scare away my critical thinking by constantly reminding me: we are watching you and behave yourself.”Last month, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a review of Confucius Institutes in British schools.Commenting on the “ccommunist takeover” of British schools, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said: “China’s strategic understanding and reach means that they have an advantage in seeking to influence others and using established brands, including some of our own, to achieve that position.“We need to decide what it is we are prepared to defend, but before that we would need to understand what it is we want.”A Department for Education spokesman said: “Owners of independent schools have a requirement to promote fundamental British values.

793,"Labour Peer and former spin doctor for ex-PM Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson reportedly told the Chinese government that people attacking the communist regime over human rights abuses will ultimately be “proved wrong”.Lord Mandelson, who was dubbed the “Prince of Darkness” during his time as communications boss for the left-wing Labour Party in the Tony Blair era, allegedly made the comments during an investor meeting on February 5th with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, alongside other CCP leaders and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.Minutes of the meeting leaked to the Mail on Sunday reportedly said: “With one side [UK] missing any governmental representation, Peter Mandelson acted in that role.”During an opening statement given to the meeting, Mandelson reportedly made “a reference to the changing political atmosphere, with ‘a movement questioning the West’s relationship with China’ and China’s desire to be a genuine long-run partner in the international system.”“We are confident that China can prove them wrong,” he allegedly said, in an apparent attempt to gloss over growing concerns among the general British public over concentration camps in Xinjiang, forced organ harvesting, and the attacks on democratic liberties in Hong Kong.The meeting refrained from levying any criticism towards the Chinese government, focussing instead on how “China and Europe can work together to do things more innovatively and better, using improved business models and technologies,” the paper claimed.They also heard from the chief executive of Prudential Mike Wells, the chairman of metals and mining giant Rio Tinto Simon Thompson, and Mark Tucker the chairman of the HSBC bank, which has been accused of colluding with the CCP by debanking pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.A former Cabinet minister under both former Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown — resigning several times from government positions over allegations of corruption — Mandelson has since re-emerged to advise Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in recent weeks.‘Indicative of Genocide’: CCP’s Abuses in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet Detailed by Tory Human Rights Commission https://t.co/HneNAtpMfm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 13, 2021Mandelson, a former member of the Youth Communist League, is alleged to be closely tied with the secretive 48 Group Club, which lobbies for closer ties between the Chinese state and the United Kingdom.A 2020 book entitled Hidden Hand: Exposing How The Chinese Communist Party Is Reshaping The World, characterises Mandelson as a “fellow” of the 48 Group Club and “one of the more loyal friends” to the Chinese Communist Party. The Labour Peer admitted to giving a speech for the 48 Group in 2004 but said in July that he could not recall if he was a fellow of the group.The book claims: “So entrenched are the [Chinese] influence networks among British elites that Britain has passed the point of no return and any attempt to extricate itself from Beijing’s orbit would probably fail.”A spokesman for Lord Mandelson’s lobbying company, Global Counsel, claimed that his remarks were taken out of context, claiming that his full remarks were thus: “We are offering each other a lot already. You will not be hearing complaints from us today – instead, how we can do things innovatively and better”, and “We realise the political climate is not perfect. There is a movement questioning the West’s relationship with China.

794,"British scientists have warned that travellers will be required to take a vaccine for the Chinese coronavirus every single time they go on a foreign holiday.A team of scientists at Oxford University in a report published in the Royal Society Journal on Friday warned that it is unclear how long vaccines will be effective in immunizing people, and therefore countries may require proof of recent vaccination.The authors of the study claimed that the concept of vaccine passports is “feasible” but stipulated that such a system should not be put into place until there is global agreement on the parameters of the scheme.One of the lead authors of the study, epidemiologist Christopher Dye of the Department of Zoology at Oxford, said per The Telegraph: “An effective vaccine passport system that would allow the return to pre-Covid activities, including travel, without compromising personal or public health, must meet a set of demanding criteria – but it is feasible.”“If we thought that the duration of protection was just a matter of months, then the sort of criteria that might be introduced – we’re not saying they should be – is that when one travels internationally for a short trip, going on vacation for example, that one is vaccinated each time on that occasion for that particular trip.”Another lead author of the report, Professor Melinda Mills, said that governments will need to determine in what circumstances a vaccine passport should be used.“Is it literally a passport to allow international travel or could it be used domestically to allow holders greater freedoms?” Professor Mills questioned.“The intended use will have significant implications across a wide range of legal and ethical issues that need to be fully explored and could inadvertently discriminate or exacerbate existing inequalities,” she explained.Ministers Pressuring Boris to Reconsider Immunity Certificates for Domestic Use: Report https://t.co/H5ZhGSzf86— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2021While government officials such as Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi and Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove have denied that the government will introduce vaccine passports, the British government has reportedly been funding eight separate projects to develop health passes.On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that vaccine passports will “inevitably” be adopted, saying: “I think that is going to be very much in the mix down the road, I think that is going to happen.”Others have warned that implementing such a system will infringe upon the hard-won liberties of Western society.Writing in The Telegraph, Silkie Carlo, the director of civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, warned that in the “war against the coronavirus” the United Kingdom risks “emerging like some sort of China-adjunct – a high-tech dystopia where citizens flash their vaccine IDs and biological risk scores to buy a pint of milk, or government-approved facial recognition for a pint of beer.”“Our country survived the 2oth century because our forebearers gave up their lives for freedom. Today, some Brits are willing to give up their freedom for just about anything,” Carlo lamented.“We feel that now this is the time for these vaccine certificates to be recognised across the European Union, and even beyond the European Union.”  https://t.co/UsZ0T3Wqw8— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 21, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropeScienceBig Brother WatchcoronavirusCoronavirus measuresCoronavirus vaccinenew world orderOxford UniversityUnited KingdomVaccinevaccine passportVaccine Passportsvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
795,"At least ten former staff members are ready to come forward as claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex bullied and “humiliated” aides are probed.Allegations that Meghan, the former Suits starlet and wife of Prince Harry, inflicted “emotional cruelty and manipulation” on staff are being investigated by Buckingham Palace, after a former aide revealed she had been the subject of a bullying complaint and accused her of driving a number of people out of their jobs.“A group of people are queuing up to be involved. They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face. Our eyes met and she lowered hers, humiliation etched on her features.”Prince William Angered by Meghan and Harry's 'Insulting, Disrespectful, and Petulant' Attitude to Queen https://t.co/kvuRJbdJA9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021Before Meghan and Harry abandoned their duties as working royals — but not their titles — to pursue money-making ventures and activism in the United States, their communications secretary wrote to Prince William’s private secretary said he was “very concerned that the Duchess [of Sussex, Meghan] was able to bully two PAs out of the household in the past year. The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
796,"The British government is reportedly preparing to launch a series of tit-for-tat trade restrictions with the European Union dubbed the “Water Wars” in response to the bloc’s ban of shellfish from the UK.The government is said to be considering placing import restrictions on European products such as mineral water and seed potatoes. The EU had previously secured a continuity agreement for the import of seed potatoes to the UK until the end of June, however, this agreement may be scrapped if Brussels refuses to budge on the seafood restrictions.A government source told The Telegraph: “There is thought being given to where we can leverage in other areas. We have continuity arrangements… we can stop these which means they won’t be able to sell their produce here.”The paper claimed that discussions within the government over banning EU products began earlier this month following the European Commission’s announcement of a permanent blockade of British shellfish, including live oysters, scallops, mussels, citing supposed public health concerns.The EU has said that seafood caught in Class B waters could still be sent to Europe if the catch is purified, however, industry experts have warned that the extra costs would severely damage the sector.Tensions apparently escalated following the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety refused to meet with UK Environment Secretary George Eustice to discuss an end to the ban on British shellfish, which reportedly angered Prime Minister Boris Johnson.‘Even Worse Than I Had Feared’: Farage on Scrutiny of Boris’s Brexit Fishing Deal https://t.co/s9ujsmgT0Z— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 29, 2020A European Commission spokesman said: “Import into the EU of live bivalve molluscs for human consumption is allowed only if they originate from classified areas A and meet all the health and sanitary requirements for molluscs destined for immediate human consumption.“Consequently, live bivalve molluscs originating from third countries from production areas classified as B or C cannot be imported into the Union as they do not meet these health requirements. This also applies to the UK, now a third country.However, the British government has highlighted an email from the EU Commission in 2019, which promised that live shellfish would be able to continue being exported to the EU after Brexit.Aside from contemplating the introduction of import restrictions on EU products, the government has also announced that it will expand the eligibility of the £23 million support package for the fishing sector, in order to help fishermen and shellfish exporters who were negatively impacted by the EU Commission.George Eustice said: “The UK fishing industry produces some of the finest seafood in Europe from the waters around our coast.“By supporting the sector through some of the current challenges we will ensure they are well placed to recover once the world turns the corner on this pandemic and emerges from lockdown.”Some have accused the European Union of U-turning on the issue of shellfish imports as an act of revenge for Brexit and for the embarrassment over ‘Speedboat Britain‘ outperforming the EU in terms of vaccinating people for the Chinese coronavirus.A senior minister told The Mail on Sunday: “This is end- of-empire stuff. They are trying to punish us for daring to become a nation-state and dread us succeeding on our own in case it encourages others to follow suit.

797,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly leading a push to begin trade talks with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) despite objections from backbench Tory MPs that Britain should not have closer economic ties with the allegedly genocidal regime in Beijing.It has been revealed that during a meeting in Downing Street with Chinese business leaders, Mr Johnson expressed his desire to deepen economic ties with China despite “whatever the political difficulties” there may be.The Prime Minister proudly told the Chinese businessmen that he is “fervently Sinophile”, at the February 12th meeting, The Guardian reported on Sunday.A bipartisan group of campaigners, including Tory backbenchers, have been seeking to add a genocide amendment to the UK’s Trade Bill that would require a High Court review of trade deals with countries, like China, which have been accused of committing genocide.However, Boris Johnson’s government has successfully blocked the introduction of the amendment on two separate occasions, using what former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith dubbed as “arcane procedural games“. The House of Lords will decide on Tuesday if they will attempt to pass the amendment for a third, and final, time.One of the main organisers of the genocide amendment and Hong Kong Watch fellow, Luke de Pulford said: “While the Uighurs are forcibly sterilised, their children brainwashed and tens of thousands enslaved, the UK is bending over backwards to secure more Chinese trade. How bad do things have to get before Boris Johnson realises that this kind of thing enables Xi Jinping’s brutal regime?”The British government suspended trade talks with China last year in response to the introduction of the draconian national security law in Hong Kong, which stripped the former UK colony of the freedoms promised under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.Yet, Mr Johnson has reportedly expressed his intention to restart talks with China through the China-UK Joint Trade and Economic Commission (Jetco) and the Economic and Financial Dialogue annual meeting between the UK and China, though no firm date has been set for either to resume.‘Indicative of Genocide’: CCP’s Abuses in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Tibet Detailed by Tory Human Rights Commission https://t.co/HneNAtpMfm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 13, 2021While the British leader has recently become embroiled in diplomatic spats with the CCP, including his decision to bar Chinese tech giant Huawei from the UK’s 5G networks over security concerns and Britain’s offer to open citizenship paths to millions of Hong Kongers, Johnson has long expressed his admiration for China.As Mayor of London, Mr Johnson backed then-Prime Minister David Camera’s push for a “golden era” of UK-Chinese relations to increase economic ties.In June of last year, Johnson said: “I’m a Sinophile and believe we should continue to work with this great and rising power.”In January, the PM declined to match the Trump administration’s call to classify persecution of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang as a genocide, claiming that such a move would have to be a “judicial matter“.On Monday, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will demand that the United Nations receive “urgent and unfettered” access to Xinjiang to investigate claims of human rights abuses.Mr Raab will submit reports of abuses in Xinjiang, including modern slavery, forced sterilisation, and torture, which he will say are “taking place on an industrial scale.”Exclusive Video — ‘Torture and Rape’: Uyghurs in London Protest Communist China’s Concentration Camps https://t.co/NOEFHdAqq8— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 9, 2019Earlier this month, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minority survivors of the concentration camp system in Xinjiang backed up longstanding allegations of human rights abuses by survivors of the camps, who have reported that prisoners are subjected to torture, rape, forced sterilisation, and organ harvesting.Speaking to the BBC, the witnesses claimed that women were regularly gang-raped and tortured, with some guards even sexually abusing women by electrocuting them from the inside with electric batons.The most recent estimates from the American government suggest that there are currently some 2 million people interned by the Chines Communist Party in concentration camps, down from as many as 3 million. The drop in population comes amid reports that the CCP sold inhabitants as slave labourers to factories across the country.  Communist officials claimed the prisoners “graduated” from the camps.The dictatorship in Beijing has previously hailed the success of the camps as liberating Uyghur women from being “baby-making machines” through their forced sterilisation programme.In a report published in January, Britain’s Conservative Party Human Rights Commission claimed that Uyghur slave labourers are forced attend “Mandarin Chinese language classes and political indoctrination classes” while being monitored for their “thoughts”.The Tory human rights commission said: “We believe that the CCP is committing mass atrocity crimes against the Uyghurs and others in [Xinjiang]… and that is evidence indicative of the crime of genocide.”Though the persecution of the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang and the vicious crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong tend to grab the most attention internationally, the Communist Party has also repressed Buddhists and Falun Gong practitioners as well as Christians.In this #Xinjiang camp, #Uyghur children are forcefully separated from their parents and ordered to chant, “My mother is China, we love our mother, we love China.”The inner workings of #China’s #Communist re-education machine on full display.pic.twitter.com/cq1Iktnj0y— Prof. Steve Hanke (@steve_hanke) February 11, 2021In the second quarter of last year, the UK imported more goods from China than any other trading partner at £11 billion, according to the Office for National Statistics, marking the first time that China topped the import list for any economic quarter.This month it was revealed that in 2020, China overtook the United States as the European Union’s top trading partner, with trade ties between the bloc set to rise by an additional €120 billion in trade through an investment pact signed December. The deal has been criticised for being signed with minimal concern for tackling China’s human rights abuses.Through the wealth accumulated in trade with Western powers, the Chinese state has embarked on what Brexit leader Nigel Farage has characterised as a “communist takeover” of the UK, as CCP billionaires have been found to be buying up struggling schools across Britain to spread communist propaganda.Firms linked to the Chinese military have also been found to be partnering with top universities in the UK to develop new weapons technologies for the communist country.Over a dozen British universities are reportedly under investigation by security services over their relationships with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which may have violated national security and human rights laws.  https://t.co/JPASmB4Fvn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaAsiaEconomyLondon / EuropeBoris JohnsonChinachina tradeChina trade dealChinese Communist PartyDominic RaabGenocidehong kong watchIain Duncan SmithtradeUK economyUnited KingdomXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
798,"Prince William is said to be “shocked” and saddened by the “insulting, disrespectful, and petulant” attitude of brother Harry and his wife Meghan to their grandmother, the Queen, following ‘Megxit’.William, second in line to the throne after the brothers’ father, 72-year-old Prince Charles, was reported to be “really sad and genuinely shocked” by the reaction of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, to the Queen announcing their royal patronages and Harry’s honorary military titles would be withdrawn.This decision came as a result of the couple’s decision to abandon their public duties as “working royals” in favour of pursuing money-making ventures and woke activism, as well as flirting with U.S. politics.“The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service,” a statement from Buckingham Palace had confirmed.“While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much-loved members of the family.”A source said that a private letter to the couple from the Queen “was warm, but also reflected her view on the business side of things that you can’t pick and choose.”Following today’s statement from Buckingham Palace, a spokesperson for the Sussexes says: pic.twitter.com/dlCWlQISiQ— Omid Scobie (@scobie) February 19, 2021“As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world,” a spokesman for Meghan and Harry responded — somewhat dubiously, given the pair spent much of 2020 striking multi-million dollar deals with woke corporations such as Netflix and Spotify.“We can all live a life of service. Service is universal,” they added in what has been interpreted as a rather sharp rebuke to the Queen — and one which has prompted critics of the Sussexes that while service is indeed universal, it typically does not come with a guarantee of prestigious military titles and lucrative royal connections by way of compensation.“You don’t answer the Queen back — it’s just not done,” said a source close to the monarch in comments to the Sunday Times.“Don’t disrespect your granny, Harry,” remarked another, more personally.The row comes as the Queen’s husband of over 70 years, Second World War veteran Prince Philip, has been hospitalised for several days, with an “exceptional” visit to his bedside by Prince Charles fueling much speculation about his condition.Prince Charles Makes 'Exceptional' Visit to Father Prince Philip, 99, in Hospital https://t.co/64ecnJUARR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021EntertainmentLondon / EuropePoliticsBritainBritish ConstitutionBritish cultureBritish Royal FamilyElizabeth IIHeritageMeghan Markleprince harryPrince Williamroyal familyThe queenTraditionUnited KingdomWokeWoke RoyalswokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
799,"A 46-year-old official at a French asylum seeker reception facility has died after being stabbed several times, allegedly by a Sudanese migrant who had his asylum claim rejected.The stabbing took place on Friday in the city of Pau at around 11 a.m. local time and reportedly saw the 38-year-old Sudanese migrant stab the 46-year-old official at least three times, with one of the stab wounds in the victim’s throat.The death of the official was announced on social media by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmamin, who wrote: “I will go to Pau at the end of the afternoon to meet the staff of the association as well as the elected officials following the dramatic assault this morning. I extend my sincere condolences to the victim’s family and loved ones.”The Sudanese migrant was arrested shortly after the attack by the Pau Anti-Crime Squad (BAC) near the crime scene.

800,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) – Rescue officials were searching Monday for the body of Jan Litynski, a Polish communist-era dissident and democracy-era politician who drowned in a river while trying to save a dog. He was 75.His death was first announced by Eugeniusz Smolar, another former democracy activist from the Solidarity era.Police spokesman Mariusz Ciarka said Monday that police are searching for Litynski’s body in the Narew River in the area around Pultusk, a town north of Warsaw.Litynski had entered the river trying to save a dog that had been on ice and had fallen into the water, and Litynski’s wife witnessed his drowning, Ciarka said. There was no information about the fate of the dog.Litynski was engaged in a student protest movement against the communist authorities in 1968. He later joined a 1970s civic movement, the Workers´ Defense Committee, which was a precursor to the Solidarity trade union and democracy movement of the 1980s, to which he also belonged.During the communist era he was arrested multiple times and was interned during the martial law crackdown imposed in 1981, according to the Rzeczpospolita daily.Litynski was a participant in the Round Table talks of 1989 that paved a peaceful transition from communism to a market economy and democracy, and went on to be a lawmaker. He was an adviser to former President Bronislaw Komorowski.He was being remembered in Poland on Monday as a good and erudite man who had done much to serve the country.London / EuropePoliticscommunismFreedomJan LitynskiPolandsolidarity.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Merkel also referenced the revival of the Iran nuclear agreement as “important steps toward more multilateral cooperation.”European Council President Charles Michel additionally stressed the need for the U.S. to fortify “the rules-based international order,” saying, “A strong partnership needs strong partners.”Meanwhile, France’s Macron took a different approach, believing Europe should do more for its own defenses and suggesting by doing so, it would strengthen the United States’ ability to focus more on the China problem. “I think it is time for us to take much more of the burden of our own protection,” he said.Israel / Middle EastLondon / EuropeNational SecurityAmerica FirstAngela MerkelBoris JohnsonEmmanuel MacronEuropean UnionG7globalismUnited NationsWorld Health Organization.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
802,"A High Court judge has ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancock acted unlawfully in failing to publish multi-billion-pound COVID-19 government contracts within the 30-day period required by law.This is a story that ought to be dominating every front page and leading every BBC news bulletin: the sums of taxpayers’ money which have been squandered in this procurement fiasco are truly scandalous; so shocking, indeed, that under normal circumstances this would bring an immediate end to the career of the minister responsible.At least £18 billion worth of contracts for protective equipment has been handed out by the government in what the Mail has called ‘cash for cronies.’Here, courtesy of the Mail, are some examples of the unlikely beneficiaries of government largesse.The NAO [National Audit Office] said it would launch an urgent investigation into one extraordinary deal for surgical gloves and gowns with a Florida-based jewellery designer where Spanish businessman, Michael Saiger, who served as a middleman, was paid an astonishing £21million in UK taxpayers’ cash.The report – which came out last week, sparked claims the Government had frittered away huge sums of public in flawed and uncompetitive contracts, sometimes buying “useless PPE”, with the ‘taxpayer now reaping the ruin’.In another case, Sabia Mokeddem, a 23-year-old investor from Lyon, France, was given £880,000 to supply 55,000 coveralls despite not having any experience in the sector.She said she acted as a go-between for a wholesaler in Hong Kong and has since completed delivery of all the coveralls, priced at £16 each. Miss Mokkedem said the coveralls cost £11 before the pandemic – but they charged £16 as market demand and rising cargo costs pushed up prices.There have been many similar cases of people with little to no relevant expertise suddenly being handed eye-wateringly large contracts. Often the equipment turned out to be useless to the point of unusability.Here is another example from Mail investigative reporter David Rose:Take Jonathon Bennett. As the Mail reported this month, he is a veteran textile importer with extensive contacts in China, where most PPE is made. His bid to supply millions of masks in April was highly competitive – well below the Government’s ‘benchmark’ price.But the £253million contract went to Ayanda Capital, a firm with no experience which was charging almost twice as much. Worse, 50 million of their masks were of the wrong design.Mr Bennett has long suspected Ayanda won its contract because it was brokered by someone who until recently had been an adviser to Trade Secretary Liz Truss – an Ayanda associate called Andrew Mills.The NAO report confirms this. It was thanks to a “referral” by Mr Mills that Ayanda’s bid got the VIP treatment.The excuse being trotted out by the government is that all contracts were awarded with “due diligence” and that any delays in reporting publicly the details of these contracts was the result of problems caused by the pandemic.But Mr Justice Chamberlain, the judge who found against Hancock, said that this was “an excuse not a justification.”Where, though, are the consequences?Britain in 2021 appears to have become so detached from democratic transparency or accountability that is now apparently possible for a small number of Conservative government insiders to award multi-million contracts to favoured, but often unsuitable cronies — and get away with it.In any remotely functioning democracy, heads would roll for this scandal. Top of the list would be the power-crazed Health Secretary Matt Hancock who has been found in breach of the law by the High Court and who must ultimately bear responsibility for the billions of pounds’ worth of squandered taxpayers’ cash.The British people really deserve better than the corrupt, cruel, and outrageously authoritarian regime currently in control of their country.

She was also quite angry and she stated there were knives and meat cleavers in the room and she also said she was in possession of a gun.“One of the officers then approached the defendant and said he needed to search her. But at this point, the defendant became very aggressive and it took several officers to apprehend her.“One was forced to draw his taser and it was then that the defendant started screaming and shouting abuse.“The defendant then went to bite the arm of the officer and managed to put her teeth on his forearm.“As a result, the officer pulled her head down with great difficulty and she constantly shouted racial abuse when being arrested and whilst getting into the police van and whilst in the van.

It’s in the interest of rich countries as well as poor countries to have equitable access,” she claimed.Okonjo-Iweala, who received the backing of the Biden administration as well as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), pointed to a study from the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) which suggested that the world would see economic damage if it fails to vaccinate poorer nations.The study claimed that the world could lose as much as $9tn (£6.4tn) in terms of GDP by the middle of next year if only richer countries have vaccinated significant portions of their populations.“Half of that cost will be borne by rich countries,” Okonjo-Iweala declared, going on to insist: “So we need to understand that it’s in the self-interest of both rich and poor to have equitable access to vaccines otherwise all counties lose; all people lose.”She did not address the impact on British and other Western businesses and workers in industries such as hospitality of remaining locked down while vaccines are sent overseas, however.Speedboat Britain to Donate Spare Vaccines to Poor Countries https://t.co/hSxcAWTGbY— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 20, 2021On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson committed to donating most of the United Kingdom’s surplus coronavirus vaccine supplies to third world nations at a virtual summit of G7 leaders.The leaders of the world’s biggest economies, excluding China and Russia, said that they will aim to make some 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine available to poorer countries through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) scheme while committing to increase funding to the programme to $7.5bn (£5.3bn).However, should the British government follow the urgings of Okonjo-Iweala and begin shipping out vaccines before inoculating native Britons, the country could risk losing the advantage of its successful vaccine rollout, particularly in comparison to the European Union.The calls for Brexit Britain to sacrifice during the pandemic from international bodies is nothing new, however.In January, a spokeswoman for the United Nations’ World Health Organization, Margaret Harris, called on the British government to suspend vaccinations after inoculating key demographics and workers in favour of shipping medicine abroad in the name of fairness in the global economy.“We’re asking all countries in those circumstances to do that: ‘hang on, wait for those [in other countries]’,” she said, adding: “We’ll also appeal to all the people of the UK – you can wait.”On Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said that the distribution of vaccines to everyone in the world is “the biggest moral test before the global community”.“Yet progress on vaccinations has been wildly uneven and unfair,” he alleged.“Just ten countries have administered 75 per cent of all COVID-19 vaccines. Meanwhile, more than 130 countries have not received a single dose. Those affected by conflict and insecurity are at particular risk of being left behind,” Guterres said.'You Can Wait' – WHO Asks UK to Pause Vaccinations Until Other Countries Catch Up https://t.co/numCx9J0zv— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropePoliticsAntonio GuterresBoris JohnsonCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineglobalismGlobalistsNgozi Okonjo-IwealaUNUnited KingdomUnited NationsVaccinevaccinesWorld Health Organizationworld trade organizationWTO.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
805,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
806,"Britain’s oldest conservative think tank is calling for a government inquiry and a judicial review to investigate the power and influence wielded by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fiancée, Carrie Symonds.The Bow Group, founded in 1951 — the year Winston Churchill would be re-elected as Prime Minister — raised concerns about the fact that Miss Symonds “holds no official role in government and is both unelected and unaccountable” but reputed to wield huge influence within the Johnson administration.The comments come among others emerging from increasingly concerned government supporters. The UK’s newspaper of record The Times reports Monday the Prime Minister has been urged to “get a grip” on the situation within Downing Street, citing “bemusement” among top Tories at goings-on.The paper cited an unnamed MP demanding order be restored at the top of government, who is reported to have said: “Even cabinet ministers don’t really know what’s going on in there… The critical thing is that this doesn’t feed through into the really serious things the government needs to get a grip on in the next few months.”Former May-era chief of staff Lord Barwell said: “I find this deeply depressing…Working at the heart of government is a privilege, not a chance to play student politics. The only person who can stop this factionalism is the PM.”Issues raised about the expanding role of the Prime Minister’s fiancée by the Bow Group think tank in a statement seen by Breitbart London include:Miss Symonds’ role in approving her friend Nimco Ali to the role of Government Advisor, in receipt of public funds.Miss Symonds’ role in the removal from the Government of Dominic Cummings, Lee Cain, and Oliver Lewis.Miss Symonds’ role in the appointments of Allegra Stratton, Henry Newman, and Baroness Finn.Miss Symonds’ role in the setting and implementation of government policy.“Even the seemingly trivial actions of instructing a taxpayer-funded photographer is unlikely to have any basis in law,” the group stressed, insisting that Miss Symonds was unlike a Special Advsiser (SpAd) insofar as “SpAds are accountable to a Minister; Ministers to the Prime Minister; the Prime Minister to the nation.”“Failure to clarify Ms Symonds’ position and authority, and to ensure that Ms Symonds is not and cannot take any action in governing the United Kingdom, potentially has huge hazards for the Government, the Conservative Party, and the nation,” warned Bow Group chairman Ben Harris-Quinney.“The public take a very dim view of cronyism, democracy in Britain is and must always be sacred, and no one should be involved in running our country without accountability to the people,” he insisted.The Bow Group calls for a Judicial Review & Inquiry into the role of the Prime Minister's girlfriend #CarrieSymonds in the Government of the United KingdomSymonds is unelected, unappointed, & unaccountable.

808,"Asylum seekers who were previously housed at taxpayer expense in a former British military accommodation in Folkestone, Kent have complained that they were “treated like criminals”.The Napier Barracks has been used by the Home Office to house some 400 illegal migrant men while their asylum claims were being processed.However, following outbreaks of the Chinese coronavirus amidst widespread flouting of the pandemic regulations, most of the migrants were moved out of the facility and into hotels across the country — free of charge — with only 63 migrants remaining in the camp.Speaking to Sky News, one of the former inhabitants of the camp, Iranian migrant Majid, complained of the conditions in the facility which used to house British soldiers.“I saw several people attempt suicide and others were self-harming. They were desperate, afraid,” he claimed.“We’ve been treated like criminals and we don’t know what we’ve done to deserve that,” he said, apparently not considering the fact that most Channel migrants make use of criminal people-smuggler networks to illegally enter British territory.“When I first got there, it was like a prison. You could see all the fences and the security guards walking around. It was really shocking for me. Twenty-eight people were in each block with just two toilets and two showers in a block,” the Iranian migrant claimed.Majid, who has since been put up in a hotel in London, said that an arson attack — which was allegedly set by migrants in the camp — was understandable due to the frustration among the inhabitants.“I was in my room and I heard my friend say one of the blocks is on fire,” he said. “When I went out, I saw the roof was completely covered in huge flames.“I felt really unsafe and it really traumatised me, seeing the fire, seeing the fear in everyone’s eyes,” he claimed.Another migrant in the camp, Mohamed, said that tensions rose amid the lack of social distancing, explaining: “We were so shocked at the state of the barracks and it was this frustration that boiled over.”“The security officers treated us very badly,” he alleged. “They didn’t want to hear from us, and we weren’t allowed to speak to anyone in authority.Illegal Migrants Unhappy with Free Accommodation in 'Racist' UK Want to Return to EU https://t.co/xBqAni6Zct— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2021On Wednesday, allegations that the barracks were “not suitable” to be used during a pandemic were put to the High Court — despite the fact social distancing does not appear to be an issue for migrants crowding into small boats to cross the English Channel in the first place — and the court has said it will allow a judicial review demanded by six migrants to go forward.The migrants are arguing that the Home Office violated their human rights by using the ex-military facility as they claimed the conditions considered acceptable for serving soldiers were too poor for them.The Home Office denied the accusations, with immigration compliance minister Chris Philp stating: “Napier has previously accommodated Army personnel and it is wrong to say it is not adequate for asylum seekers.“The department takes the welfare of those in our care extremely seriously and are working closely with our providers and with Public Health England to ensure that any individuals who have to self-isolate can do so and are following all medical advice closely.”Sky News: ‘Desperate’ Migrants In Glasgow Stabbing Hotel Unhappy with ‘Limited WiFi’, ‘Poor’ Food https://t.co/DrWDSvtUAk— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 26, 2020Amid record-breaking illegal boat migration, the Home Office began housing migrants, some of whom were lethally violent, in hotels across the country, a phenomenon brought to light in large part by Brexit leader Nigel Farage.As the waves of illegal migrants continued to pour into the country, the government began using former military bases, such as the Napier barracks, to accommodate the overflowing migrant population.Responding to the complaints from migrants about the conditions in the camp, Mr Farage said on Tuesday: “It almost beggars belief that this is going on in court… and you can bet your life that the next time we get a spell of calm weather the dinghies will start crossing the Channel again and not a single person will be turned around and sent back.”“The food is no good.

809,"AP, MADRID — Spanish authorities say they have found and rescued 41 migrants in the past four days who tried to reach continental Europe from North Africa, some of them hiding inside a container of discarded glass bottles and a bag of toxic ash.Among the 35 people found only on Friday trying to travel to Europe from the Spanish port of Melilla, an enclave in North Africa, four hid among bottles and other glass partially broken in pieces and with sharp edges that were destined for recycling, the Spanish Civil Guard said Monday.A video released by the police also shows another incident in which an officer first finds a motionless leg sticking out of a large plastic bag containing ash from the city’s incinerator, a material that is considered highly toxic. When the agent starts removing the ash, the alleged stowaway seems to recover consciousness.The port of Melilla, where trucks and containers embark on a trip to Spain that can take up to seven hours, is together with the nearby Ceuta enclave a target for many migrants trying to reach the European mainland.Some of them try to enter the fenced area of the harbor by swimming there or by hiding in vehicles, in some cases jumping on to them when they slow down or stop at the gates of the port.The Civil Guard says that it found 11,700 people last year inside the Melilla port’s security perimeter and that in 2021 so far, the figure has reached 1,781 migrants.AfricaImmigrationLondon / EuropeEurope Migrant CrisisMelillaSpain.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
810,"Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga said the Hungarian government was willing to get rid of a law making foreign-funding of NGOs transparent after the European Commission began an infringement procedure earlier this week.The European Commission launched the infringement procedure after citing a Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling from June of last year that called on Hungary to get rid of the law that regulated NGOs receiving foreign cash.The ruling itself came after the Commission had referred the case to the court in 2017. Hungary was making NGOs receiving over 7.2 million Hungarian forints ($26,000/£20,000) disclose their funding more openly and register as a “foreign-supported organisation”.On Friday, Minister Varga said that despite considering the Commission’s move a “politically motivated procedure” Hungary would look to scrap the law in the spring of this year as requested, Hungary Today reports.“While some opposition politicians are rejoicing for the initiative of an unfair infringement proceeding against their country in Brussels, the Hungarian government is doing its job,” Varga stated.EU: Hungary Can’t Make ‘Soros Network’ NGOs Identify as ‘Foreign-Funded’ Under EU Law https://t.co/aC966d7HeF— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 14, 2020In 2017, the law was seen as a counter to the influence of billionaire plutocrat George Soros and his large network of NGOs. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban has frequently criticised Soros and his NGOs for their attempts to influence Hungarian politics in the past.“George Soros and his NGOs want to transport one million migrants to the EU per year. He has personally, publicly announced this programme and provides a financial loan for it. You could read this yourselves,” Orban said in April of 2017.The dismantling of the NGO law is just the latest blow for Hungary in the European Union courts and comes after the European Court of Justice ruled that the Orban government had engaged in pushbacks of migrants at the Serbian border and violated EU rules.In January, the European Union border agency Frontex announced it would be halting operations in Hungary over the issue.Hungary’s Secretary of State for International Communication and Relations, Zoltán Kovács, reacted to the Frontex announcement saying: “Not as if we got a lot of help from Frontex, but it seems Brussels wants to take away even the little bit we did get.”“Hungary is not going to give in to pressure from pro-migration forces.

812,"Applications for asylum in European Union and associated states collapsed to a seven-year low in 2020, with coronavirus-imposed travel restrictions suggesting that some level of border control is, in fact, possible.Some 461,3000 applications for asylum were lodged across the EU, Norway, and Switzerland in 2020 — a 31 per cent fall from 2019 and taking numbers to levels not seen since 2013, before the migrant crisis in the middle of the last decade.The European Union blamed the decrease in applications on Covid-related “emergency measures, such as movement restrictions”.Despite the significant fall, the reduction was not uniform, with arrivals from particular areas and at certain times of the year taking greater hits. Asylum applications from countries like Iran and Georgia fell much faster than the average, going down 61 per cent in 2020.Syria was more stable, falling just nine per cent — perhaps a feature of the nationality’s 84 per cent asylum success rate, a reflection of Syrians getting preferential asylum treatment in Europe, driving some to lie about their identities to improve their chances — while others actually rose.Cubans, Brazilians, and Belarussians all saw higher numbers of arrivals last year, even though all three are from countries for whom the vast majority of applicants have their asylum claims rejected by European nations. Not that such figures may worry potential asylum seekers, however. As the European Commissioner for Migration Ylva Johansson admitted last week, just a third of rejected asylum seekers actually go home.While applications through 2019 ran between 40,000 and 60,000 a month, 2020 was much less uniform. A massive collapse in the first few months of the year saw first-time applications at just 7,500 in April 2020, but they soon rose and levelled off again at around 38,000 a month for the rest of the year as the initial lockdowns wore off around Europe.The European Asylum Support Office, a body founded in 2010 to ensure “practical cooperation between Member States on matters related to asylum”, put a positive spin on the serious fall in their key metric, noting the fall in applications over the year meant national governments were able to work through some of the considerable backlogs of historical asylum application cases.Nevertheless, by the end of the year, there were still over 412,000 pending asylum applications Europe-wide, a fall of just 17 per cent from the year before.ImmigrationLondon / EuropeEurope Migrant CrisisEuropean Union.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
813,"The British government’s Home Office has launched a bizarre social media campaign in the style of the decidedly retro anti-pirating warnings from the early millennium, including one message telling Britons “You shouldn’t make your own pub”.In an effort to discourage Britons from socialising with each other after nearly a year of lockdowns and social distancing, the Home Office has resorted to a hard-hitting social campaign, showing clips of police busting baby showers or raiding friends getting together in makeshift “Covid Pubs”.The footage, overlayed with retro late 90s techo music, includes banners with warnings  such as, “You shouldn’t go to parties”, “You shouldn’t make your own pub”, “You shouldn’t go to raves”, “You shouldn’t hold baby showers”, “You shouldn’t be meeting up. Meeting up is against the law”, ending with the government’s favourite slogan: “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives.”
Social media users were quick to pick up on the clear homage to the iconic 2007 anti-piracy ad campaign which at the time attempted to discourage internet users from downloading illegal copies of films and music, which used a similar style to warn:You wouldn’t steal a car

814,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) – Hungary’s government launched an online questionnaire Thursday asking citizens to give their opinions on lifting pandemic restrictions as weeks of declining COVID-19 cases have started to rise again.The government calls the set of seven questions a “national consultation,” an informal, non-scientific poll that officials say is meant to gauge public sentiment. The questions cover the possible lifting of restrictions that have been in place since Nov. 11, including an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and the mandatory closure of hotels and restaurants which have been in place since Nov. 11.The consultation also asks whether sporting facilities like gyms and swimming pools should be among the first establishments opened once restrictions are lifted, and whether restrictions should be eased gradually or halted simultaneously “at the end of the pandemic.”“Some say that if the pandemic situation allows, one of the first steps should be reopening restaurants and hotels while maintaining strict safety guidelines. Do you agree?” one question reads.Hungary, which weathered the first months of the coronavirus pandemic with few recorded cases and deaths, struggled through the fall and now winter to keep the numbers down. As of Thursday, 14,035 people had died of coronavirus-related causes in the country of less than 10 million, giving Hungary the 12th worst death rate per 100,000 inhabitants in the world, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Hungary Becomes First European Nation to Receive Chinese Sinopharm Coronavirus Vaccine https://t.co/hTmt9lrlOS— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021A steady decline in daily cases and deaths that began in late December began reversing course early this month, even as the country began receiving shipments of Russian and Chinese vaccines. Hungary is so far the only Europe Union member to depart from the EU’s vaccine procurement program by securing doses made in China and Russia.The government conducted a previous national consultation last summer on the lifting of restrictions and economic recovery, which it used rhetorically as a popular mandate to keep the country open even as pandemic indicators worsened dramatically in September and October.In an interview in September, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the results of the summer consultation showed that Hungarians did not want strict pandemic measures imposed.“This is what they told us in the questionnaires: that they don´t want the country to come to a standstill. They want it to continue functioning,” he said.Orban’s government has used other consultations in recent years to demonstrate support for its policies on immigration and EU relations.The new questionnaire also asks citizens whether they believe an immunity certificate, a document the government says will be issued to those who have been vaccinated against the virus or have already recovered from infection, should afford people exemption from certain restrictions. The possibility of keeping Hungary’s borders closed to foreign citizens unless they have an immunity certificate is also raised.Exclusive: Hungary Scrapping Income Tax for Under-25s to Support Youth, Families https://t.co/VosnyVe6TX— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021HealthLondon / EuropeSciencecoronavirusEuropean UnionHungary.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
815,"President Joe Biden reassured European leaders Friday that he would once again work with them, apologizing for former President Donald Trump’s approach while in office.“I’m sending a clear message to the world America is back … we are not looking backward, we are looking forward together,” Biden said.The president delivered remarks virtually from the White House to the Munich Security Conference on Friday.“The last four years have been hard but Europe and the United States have to lead with competence once more,” he said.While not naming Trump explicitly in his speech, Biden repeatedly lamented damages to the European relationships with the United States and promised to revert back to the way it used to be.“I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined to reengage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership,” he said.As part of his message to Europe, Biden specifically promised to work with European leaders including his “good friends” and “outstanding leaders” like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a leader that Trump challenged during his presidency.“Let me erase any lingering doubt, the United States will closely with our European Union partners, and the capitols across the continent,” he said.Biden said he appreciated a “whole” Europe united under the European Union and spoke about their goal to unite against global competitors like Russia and China.“Competition from China is going to be stiff,” Biden said. “That’s what I expect. That’s what I welcome.”Biden said Europe and the United States had to be “clear-eyed” about public spending into the future and promised to work to prevent threats like climate change.He also warned of the threat posed by Russia, citing the importance of protecting Ukraine from Russian incursion.“The challenges with Russia may be different than the ones with China but they are just as real,” he said.London / EuropePoliticsAngela MerkelDonald TrumpEuropeEuropean UnionJoe BidenMunich Security Conference.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
816,"LONDON (AP) – Buckingham Palace confirmed Friday that Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, will not be returning to royal duties, and Harry will give up his honorary military titles – a decision that makes formal, and final, the couple’s split from the royal family.When Harry and Meghan stepped away from full-time royal life in early 2020, it was agreed the situation would be reviewed after a year.Now it has, and the palace said in a statement that the couple, also known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have verified “they will not be returning as working members of The Royal Family. ”It said Queen Elizabeth II had spoken to Harry and confirmed “that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family, it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service.”The palace said Harry´s appointment as captain general of the Royal Marines and titles with other military groups would revert to the queen before being distributed to other members of the family.Harry, who served in the British army for a decade and has a close bond with the military, founded the Invictus Games competition for wounded troops.“While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family,” the palace statement said.American actress Meghan Markle, a former star of the TV legal drama “Suits,” married Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, at Windsor Castle in May 2018. Their son, Archie, was born a year later.In early 2020, Meghan and Harry announced they were quitting royal duties and moving to North America, citing what they said were the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media. They live in Santa Barbara, California and are expecting their second child.They recently announced that they will speak to Oprah Winfrey in a TV special to be broadcast next month.A spokesperson for the couple hit back at suggestions that Meghan and Harry were not devoted to duty.“As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the U.K. and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organizations they have represented regardless of official role,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “We can all live a life of service.

817,"The United Kingdom, which the EU compared to a “speedboat” in vaccine development, has committed to giving 80 per cent of its spare doses to the third world once all adults in Britain have been vaccinated.Hundreds of millions of vaccines will be sent to the worldwide distribution programme Covax, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged on Friday at a virtual meeting of the G7. The British will give out 20 per cent of their doses directly, including possibly to the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the struggling European Union, as earlier suggested.“The development of viable coronavirus vaccines offers the tantalising prospect of a return to normality,” Prime Minister Johnson will tell the world’s top seven global economy nations, according to The Times. “But we must not rest on our laurels. As leaders of the G7, we must say today: never again.”The teleconference between the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, and representatives from the European Council and European Commission is a precursor to the in-person summit in Cornwall, England, in June.Britain has ordered 407 million doses of seven types of coronavirus vaccine — far more than needed to innoculate its 66 million citizens. The prime minister has made the commitment not only on moral but practical grounds, to get the virus under control globally to reduce the spread.“The UK is clear that as a world leader, we have a moral and national interest in making this happen, which is why we are committing to share the majority of any future surplus doses with Covax to support the countries who need them most,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has admitted that the European Union was at fault for the delays to rolling out vaccines to European citizens. https://t.co/ToRJh0WCFA— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 11, 2021Britain’s generosity comes as a result of the country having such a large quantity of spare doses available, thanks to the British cutting loose from the European Union’s medical agency after Brexit. Prime Minister Johnson took a gamble in investing in pharmaceutical projects early on in the pandemic, which ultimately paid off. On December 2nd, the United Kingdom became the first Western country to have certified for use a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus.The EU, meanwhile, demanded that all its member-states relinquish their autonomy in vaccine procurement and hand over responsibility to Brussels in a system that was plagued with bureaucracy and delays and resulted in the British at one point having vaccinated more people than the entire EU27 combined.Despite France’s own struggles to inoculate its citizens, globalist President Emmanuel Macron, with the support of Germany’s Angela Merkel, has demanded that developed countries donate five per cent of their stock immediately, whether their populations are protected or not.“I think the EU is still adjusting somewhat, as we thought they might, to the existence of a genuinely independent actor in their neighbourhood,” Frost said. https://t.co/dbfUsr9tH4— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 10, 2021Julia Hartley-Brewer of talkRADIO asked the House of Commons Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood why the British taxpayer should be bailing out the world with coronavirus vaccines, when the G7 should be demanding China foot the bill.Mr Elwood responded without any hesitation — in tacit acknowledgement that communist China was at fault for the global spread of the virus — saying: “Yes, absolutely right. This is the sort of collective demand we can make.“What we’ve seen with China is that they pluck countries off one by one. Australia dared to suggest that there should be an investigation into the outbreak itself. Who was Patient Zero? Where was Ground Zero? And they had tariffs imposed on them.“If we’re going to stand up to China, we’re going to have to do it collectively, and the one body that now has that power is the G7, empowered if you take it even further to a G10.”The committee chairman suggested that Britain’s move was a form of vaccine diplomacy, saying: “I do agree with you. There will be taxpayers saying, ‘Why should we do this?’ Only if it’s brought up and we step forward and show an example can we get other nations, including groups of nations such as the EU, to follow us.”Ms Hartley-Brewer, however, expressed doubt the G7 would try to hold China to account, responding: “Never going to happen, is it? China is going to get away with it, and we’ll just go back to normal business.”Last April a poll found that nearly three-quarters of Britons thought that China was to blame for the coronavirus pandemic, with 83 per cent wanting Chain to face an inquiry and 71 per cent wanting the communist state to pay damages to the rest of the world if found guilty of a cover-up.China Lied, People Died: Five Eyes Report Details CCP Coronavirus Cover-up https://t.co/sHLCxA7ZRt— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 2, 2020London / EuropePoliticsScienceBoris JohnsonBrexitChinaChinese coronaviruscoronavirusCOVID-19donationEUEuropean UnionG7lockdownpandemicUnited KingdomvaccinationVaccinationsVaccinevaccinesWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
818,"A street in Wales has been put on the naughty step by the Welsh government because of its supposed historical associations with the slave trade. But the man after whom it is named was in fact one of Britain’s most ardent and heroic anti-slavers.Peel Street in Wrexham is one of dozens of streets put on a warning list as part of a £170,000 audit — The Slave Trade and the British Empire — commissioned by the Welsh government in the wake of the briefly fashionable Black Lives Matter protests.Though it doesn’t make it onto the Red danger list reserved for alleged monsters like Christopher Columbus, Lord Kitchener, Clive of India, and Francis Drake — “definite personal culpability” — it does make it onto the next-worst amber list marked “personal culpability uncertain”.But the only reason it’s “uncertain” is because of the sloppiness of the woke crusaders who put the report together. They have confused Sir Robert Peel — the anti-slavery prime minister — with his slavery-supporting father.True, both men confusingly share the same name. But the son was much more famous than the father and it’s after the son that the street is definitely named.The mistake was spotted by journalist Tom Winnifrith who lives nearby.He explains here:It is named after his son, also called Sir Robert Peel who was not only an MP but also the Prime Minister. The clue is in the names of neighbouring streets: Bright, Cobden, and Villiers. What links the most famous men with those names and Peel? All were politicians in the nineteenth century and were the most important men in the abolition of the Corn Laws. Pushing through their abolition cost Peel his career since ,most in his party supported the Laws. But Peel knew it was the right thing to do to alleviate misery and starvation among the poor of this land. It is surely right to honour all four men for their good works on this matter.Peel the Younger, he adds, was most definitely on the right side of the slavery argument:The Younger Peel argued massively with his father on one big issue: slavery. The younger Peel was a lifelong abolitionist.  In 1818. Peel was a member of the Earl of Liverpool government that signed treaties with Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands abolishing the slave trade. Peel supported the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire in 1834. When Peel was prime minister, 1841 – 46, his government made treaties with South American countries such as Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Chile in 1843 abolishing the slave trade. In 1845, Peel authorised the establishment of the Anti-Slavery squadron with thirty-six ships, which made it one of the largest fleets in the world. Its role was to stamp out slavers sending poor folks to America.It is clear that Peel Street in Wrexham is most certainly named after a man who not only fought slavery throughout his life but actually drove that agenda with success. And he also saved hundreds of thousands of poor folks back in Britain and Ireland from starvation.Winnifrith goes on to quote the leader of the group which led the woke audit:Gaynor Legall, Leader of the task and finish group who led the audit, said: “This a piece of work that I am immensely proud of because it gives a very thorough, factual account of Wales’ involvement in the Slave Trade and expands our knowledge of the history of Wales. It will hopefully lead to children learning the complete history, warts and all.”Hmm. Interesting use of the words ‘thorough’ and ‘factual’, there. If you’re going to audit history, surely the least you ought to be able to do is get your basic facts right. There was a time, really not so long ago, when any half-way decent historian would have twigged instantly the connection between Peel, Bright, Cobden, and Villiers. But this level of basic knowledge is being eroded as universities increasingly use their history courses not as a way of understanding the past but pouring scorn on it and politicising it with modish concepts like “decolonising the curriculum”.I’m reminded of the story a few years back when vigilantes vandalised the home of a paediatrician. They thought that it meant the same thing as paedophile. That was in Wales too. Maybe the general ignorance has grown more widespread…Scotland’s oldest public museum has created the position of ‘Curator of Discomfort’ to take the museum out of its “institutional comfort zone” and confront historical and modern-day “white supremacy”. https://t.co/wFHGqDnvlq— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2021  London / EuropePoliticsacademiaacademic biasBlack Lives MatterBlack Lives Matter UKBLMBritish HistoryCommunity CohesionHeritageHistoryIconoclasmMulticulturalismSir Robert PeelSlaverySocial CohesionstatuesWalesWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

The far-left terrorist, known as a hitman for the Revolutionary Organization 17 November (17N) terrorist group from 1975 to 2000, has been on hunger strike since January after demanding to be moved out of a maximum-security prison.Anarchists were believed to be behind the firebombing of the office of the conservative New Democracy party in the Athens suburb of Nea Filadelfei earlier this month.Greek Minister of Development and Investment Adonis Georgiadis posted pictures of the damage to the office on Twitter and condemned the attack, saying: “The miserable thugs of the Far Left burned the offices of our [local branch] with Molotov cocktails in Nea Filadelfeia.”A Greek television programme later published a claim of responsibility for the attack from anarchists, who stated the bombing was in response to Koufodinas’s hunger strike.Just days later, a group of anarchist extremists stormed the offices of the state-run Athens-Macedonian News Agency in support of the terrorist, evading arrest by leaving the scene before officers arrived.Far-left anarchist extremists have been accused of setting fire to a local office of the Greek ruling New Democracy party in the Athens suburb of Nea Filadelfeia over the weekend. https://t.co/hz9DeCikBw— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 9, 2021Also this month, a small bomb was left at a building in Athens that houses several newspapers, resulting in minor damage to the entrance of the building.While the building has been the target of far-left extremists in the past, it is currently unknown who planted this device.Law and OrderLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeAlt-LeftanarchistsAntifaDimitris KoufodinasEUEuropean Unionfar leftfar-left extremismfar-left ideologyGreeceLeft-ExtremismNew Democracy partySocial CohesionTerrorists.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
821,"Thousands of Hong Kongers have already applied to a new UK visa scheme opened at the end of January in response to the Chinese Communist Party’s crackdown on democracy and personal liberty in the former British Crown Colony.Nearly 5,000 Hong Kongers have applied for visas since the new immigration route was opened on January 31st, according to The Times, with experts estimating total application could hit 145,000 by the end of the year if the current rate is maintained.Initially open to Hong Kongers holding British National Overseas (BNO) citizenship — a relic of the Cantonese-speaking Special Administrative Region’s long years as a part of the British Empire, before the UK transferred it to the communist regime in Beijing (Peking) in 1997. Nearly 25 years later, many Hong Kongers retain a strong sense of affinity with Britain, especially as Chinese repression and state interference has increased.In time, the scheme will be open to some 5.4 million Hong Kongers, with a clear path to full British citizenship.Pathway to UK Citizenship Now Open to Millions of Hong Kongers https://t.co/X1YiTHedtX— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2021Migration experts have reportedly expressed surprise at the number of early applications, with Dr Peter William Walsh of the Migration Observatory telling The Times: “It’s not an insubstantial number and it’ll be interesting to see how much it trails off. It would be something like 145,000 by the end of the year if it continued at that rate.”British officialdom’s grasp on immigration has long been incredibly poor, with the New Labour government having (in)famously projected that just 5,000 to 13,000 people, net, would migrate to Britain a year if it threw open the doors to EU free movement migration to new Central European member-states in 2004.While this was understood to be a massive underestimate fairly quickly, recent events have shown the state is no more clued in on the number of migrants in the country. Those crossing borders are not counted in and out systematically, with official estimates instead being based in large part on a crude voluntary survey of some travellers. Indeed, over five million EU migrants have applied for settled status in Britain post-Brexit despite the resident EU migrant population having previously been estimated at around three million.The Johnson administration has given no indication that it is even considering putting a cap on annual immigration in order to ensure the already soaring numbers do not go completely out of control as a result of the Hong Kong scheme, at a time when British workers, the public finances, and public services are already under huge strain as a result of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns.More Than Five Million EU Migrants Have Applied to Stay in UK https://t.co/bjVXSY9Fsv— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2021ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsBritainBritish EmpireCCPChinaChinese Communist PartyChinese Communist Party (CCP)communismcommunistsCommunity CohesionConservative PartydiversityHong KongMass MigrationMigrantssMulticulturalismSocial CohesionToriesTory partyUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
822,"Feminists have denounced proposals to honour war heroes who won the Victoria Cross and George Cross with hometown statues because not enough of them are women.Awarded, often posthumously, for the “most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice, or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy”, each Victoria Cross is struck from bronze taken from captured enemy guns, and it is regarded as the highest military honour in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth. So rarely is the medal given, there are just nine living recipients of them worldwide.The George Cross is considered the VC’s equal in merit, and is awarded for similarly outstanding gallantry not in the face of the enemy, often to civilians. Famously the Queen’s father, George VI, collectively bestowed the honour upon the island of Malta for the heroism of its population while besieged by the Axis powers during the Second World War, and the island nation’s flag bears that cross to this day.The proposal for every VC and GC winner to be honoured with a statue to create a new generation of public sculpture came at a time when the Black Lives Matter movement and its sympathisers are pressing to tear down statues to historic figures, including war heroes, or “recontextualise” them. In practice, this typically means new plaques or information boards disparaging the subject for alleged offence against modern left-wing sensibilities — but BLM has not been cited in initial efforts to squash the proposal.Instead, the feminist group InVisiblewomen, described by the Guardian as “a virtual museum and national campaign for gender equality in UK civic statues”, has complained the move would be “wholly retrograde” because not enough VC and GC heroes are women.It's wrong to criticise statues of VC winners because of identity politics. Statues should reflect merit, not quotas.

They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face.

The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

With the recent success of the UK’s vaccine rollout and Prime Minister Johnson’s earlier suggestion that Britons have seen the last of tiers, Mr Johnson is anticipated to outline on Monday his strategy for taking England out of lockdown, even if slowly, together.Former Prime Minister Blair has published his own “roadmap” through his Tony Blair Institute (TBI) with a traffic light system — from red, amber, to green — that associates different markers for infection levels to what parts of society should be reopened, according to the report seen by The Telegraph.The TBI plans allow for “both regional and local variation in restrictions”, claiming that “the Government should not ditch its locally-varied approach to restrictions. A rigid national approach alone will either impose unnecessary economic and social costs to contain the virus or fail to contain it at all.”It also claims that even once the whole adult population is vaccinated and immune, “it is far from clear that it will be possible to remove all restrictions without having in place a comprehensive containment infrastructure, likely involving digital health passes, better incentives for self-isolation and widespread availability of rapid testing”.Mr Blair has been a vocal advocate of “digital health passes”, calling for “health passports” in December, asserting: “I know all the objections, but it will happen.”Tony Blair Advising British Govt on Vaccinations, Pushes for ‘COVID Passes’ https://t.co/XCOws0J0IG— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 12, 2021The TBI report also advises against giving Britons dates by which they can expect to have their rights restored to them, and rejects calls from a group of lockdown sceptic MPs, the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), to lift lockdown at the end of April when the most vulnerable people will have been vaccinated.CRG Chairman Mark Harper told the BBC’s Question Time: “That’s two and a half months away, we are only one and a half months into this lockdown. So I don’t think in another two and a half months’ time that can really be described as a massive rush.“I think it’s actually taking it carefully and cautiously, in line with the rollout of the vaccination… Our view is once you’ve vaccinated those people and reduced hospitalisations by 80 per cent then you can remove the domestic restrictions.”Despite a legacy of controversies surrounding the former Labour prime minister — including his involvement in the invasion of Iraq, his open borders immigration policy during his premiership, and his recent attempts to foil Brexit — Blair’s Institute reportedly has “strong links to the upper echelons of Whitehall and the Palace of Westminister”, according to The Telegraph, which speculates that it is “probable” that Johnson’s news proposals could share similarities to those recommended by Blair.Not only has Blair pushed for immunity certificates, but is pressuring the Conservative government to take a lead in developing a “Global Covid Travel Pass” at June’s G7 summit, claiming the UK has only two choices: “Lead or be led.”Tony Blair Rejoices: Joe Biden Can Unite the World https://t.co/mHqBCokxzv— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 13, 2020London / EuropePoliticsScienceChinese coronaviruscoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownpandemicTony BlairUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
826,"Former football player Dylan Duby has admitted to Belgian police that he was paid €10,000 (£8,645/$12,115) to murder entrepreneur Frank Goes, who was stabbed to death in the street last year.The 24-year-old, who previously played for Belgian club RUS Givry as a midfielder until 2019, admitted to his part in the killing of the 54-year-old businessman who was stabbed to death on September 29th last year in the municipality of Jette as he was leaving the offices of his business for the evening.According to a report from Sudinfo, Duby confessed to his part in the plot and named an intermediary who gave him the contract for the killing. The businessman is said not to have been the only person on the hitlist and from information provided by Duby, police issued three more arrest warrants in the case.Duby was identified in connection to the murder along with another 24-year-old suspect named Ishmael D., in November after police were able to trace the identification of a rental car used by the alleged killers of Mr. Goes.One of the three men recently arrested by police is said to have been a business rival of Mr. Goes, who made his living in real estate. Youssef A., a contractor who specialized in renovations of building facades, is alleged to be the client who ordered the killing.The motive for the murder plot, according to HLN, was that both Youssef A. and Goes were bidding on a lucrative contract and Youssef A. wanted to simply scare Goes, rather than kill him. Youssef A. has denied any involvement in the murder.Duby is not the first football player to be involved in a high-profile murder in recent years. In 2015, Brazilian former goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes was handed a 22-year prison sentence for the murder of his former girlfriend Eliza Samudio.Samudio was killed in 2010 after he strangled her to death, dismembered her body, and fed the remains to dogs.Last year, Fernandes, who had been allowed to serve out a “semi-open” sentence at his home since 2019, was criticized for posing with several dogs to promote a local kennel.Law and OrderLondon / EuropeSportsBelgiumBrusselscontract killingDylan DubyFootballFrank GoesHitmanMurder.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

828,"Britain may finally be making some progress on the Channel migrant crisis, with boat crossings reportedly 70 per cent following a £28m pay-off to the French authorities.While the Boris Johnson administration still seems unwilling to countenance simply turning boats back to France and the Low Countries from which illegal migrants set sail, its decision to pay the French to stop them from using their coastline as a staging post — on top of millions already handed over to strengthen security in and around Calais — does appear to have borne some fruit.Attempted crossings are up 50 per cent on the same period last year, to 950, but according to the Telegraph some 70 per cent have been prevented. The Home Office is also preparing to attempt the removal of illegals who have arrived under post-Brexit legislation disallowing asylum applications from migrants travelling to Britain from safe countries by sea.“As a result of our improved intelligence-sharing with the French and enhanced surveillance, we have stopped approximately 700 crossings in 2021, despite there being a 50 per cent increase in crossing attempts on last year,” said Chris Philp, junior minister at the Priti Patel-led Home Office.“However, we are not complacent. We will step up our activity into spring and are aware there is much more to do to make this route non-viable, and target the vile organised crime gangs who facilitate these dangerous crossings,” he continued, adding that “Now we have left the EU we have changed the law meaning those who have travelled through safe countries will have their asylum cases treated as inadmissible.”It has hitherto proved difficult to remove bogus asylum seekers even after their claims have been rejected, however, with judges blocking flights back even to perfectly safe European Union member-states such as Spain due to deportees receiving insufficiently lavish assistance on arrival in Madrid, for example.Overall, deportations even of migrants convicted of crimes in Britain plummeted by 79 per cent in 2020. The trend may be set to continue this year, too, with the courts recently blocking the removal of a double rapist because he might not receive adequate mental health care in his native Somalia.“The Government are working as fast as possible to fix the broken asylum system to make it firm and fair,” Philp claimed.‘It Never Stops’: Nearly 300 Illegal Boat Migrants Land in UK After Brexit https://t.co/XnupTbmBmd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 10, 2021Despite the Home Office’s tough words on tackling people-smugglers, however, their punishments are typically fairly light.The government-friendly Daily Mail, for example, reported at the beginning of 2020 on Home Secretary Patel’s boast that 100 people-smugglers had been imprisoned “for a total of 320 years” over the course of 2019. While at first blush this is an impressive number, it is less impressive once those 320 years are divided among all 100 convicts — and much less impressive once the fact that inmates are typically entitled to automatic early release on licence halfway through their terms is taken into account.By way of example, two Ukrainian people-smugglers who smuggled Albanian illegal aliens to England from the Netherlands were handed terms of just two-and-a-half years in November 2020 — meaning they should be out on licence before 2021 is out if the standard halfway point release rules are applied.Asylum Seekers Stage Hunger Strike over Quality of Free Hotel Food https://t.co/GCoIrToRls— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021 ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsasylum seekersBoat MigrantsBrexitBritainChannel CrisisChannel MigrantsChris PhilpEUEurope Migrant CrisisEuropean Unnionhome officeIllegal AliensIllegal Immigrantsillegal immigrationMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant Crisispriti patelUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
829,"The Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), a group the French government moved to dissolve in the aftermath of the terrorist murder of Samuel Paty, is to relocate to Brussels under a new name.The CCIF, which French President Emmanuel Macron targetted for dissolution in the wake of the Islamist-inspired beheading of the history teacher, is expected to relocate to neighbouring Belgium, to become the Collective Against Islamophobia in Europe (CCIE) instead. In dissolving itself and moving abroad in the face of the government pursuing it, the body has effectively jumped before it could be pushed by Macron’s anti-extremism crackdown.But Belgian MP Denis Ducarme has said he will challenge the justice and interior ministers over the proposal, and intends to ask Minister of Justice Vincent Van Quickenborne to look into dissolving the association once it arrives in his country, Belgian magazine Le Vif reports.Macron Govt Proposes Dissolving Major Islamist Associations After Teacher Beheading https://t.co/N90nY0RouO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2020“Our country cannot become a zone of retreat for Islamists again,” Ducarme said, likely referring to how Bataclan terrorist Salah Abdeslam was able to hide in Brussels’ notorious Molenbeek immigrant district for months following the November 2015 Paris terror attacks before Belgian police eventually caught him in 2016.“I consider it extremely dangerous to allow such an organisation to establish itself in Belgium, given the actions of its members in France,” Ducarme added.The CCIF voluntarily dissolved itself at the end of October last year, prior to the French government decree that accused it of giving legitimacy to “a permanent suspicion of religious persecution likely to stir up hatred, violence or discrimination”, according to newspaper Le Monde.The paper noted that as early as November, French nationals had filed documents to set up the CCIE in Belgium. Earlier this month, the CCIF told its followers that it would be transferring its assets to other groups, including the CCIE.Belgian Minister of Justice Vincent Van Quickenborne commented on the issue earlier this week, saying there would be no automatic ban on the group, but the intelligence services would monitor the group if needed.Brussels: Nearly 200 Islamic Terror-Related 'Entities' Shut Down Since 2014 https://t.co/3ntofWgbhH— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2021Law and OrderLondon / EuropeBelgiumBrusselsCollective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF)FranceIslamismIslamophobiaPolitical Islam.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
830,"London mayor Sadiq Khan has suggested it is critics of his scheme to audit place names and historic statues in the British capital who are trying to “engineer a culture war”, rather than the would-be iconoclasts who have made memorials an issue of them in the first place.“Some people are trying to engineer a culture war because it plays to the hinterland or it gets more listeners to LBC,” said Mayor Khan on the LBC radio station, after the host — former BBC presenter and fanatical anti-Brexiteer James O’Brien — said some people were suggesting he “spent more time worrying about statues than stabbed teenagers.”“I don’t apologise for walking ’round my city as I do and not seeing many street names, murals, statues or names of buildings that reflect the contribution made by a diverse population,” Khan added — despite having earlier said he did not spend “a lot” of time worrying about public monuments.The Labour politician announced a so-called Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm after Black Lives Matter disorder in the United States crossed the Atlantic in 2020, with many of the movement’s acolytes fixating on public statues and other memorials to the great men and women of British history as the main targets of their ire.The commission’s members have proved controversial, with one having once had to be dragged out of Westminster Abbey for screaming at the Queen and threatening to “punch out” security during a religious service marking the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade.WATCH: Khan Statues Adviser Screamed at Queen in Church, Threatened to 'Punch Out' Security  https://t.co/4lfF2Cvryz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021Mayor Khan’s attempts to turn the tables on statue defenders and claim they are the ones trying to start a “culture war” by resisting leftist efforts to sweep away much of the country’s built heritage comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel told LBC she was firmly opposed to municipal politicians like Khan moving against statues after they were targeted by violent BLM supporters.“We saw statues being brought down and some councils making, quite frankly, a stance around statues and street names,” she said on February 12th.“There are other ways in which those discussions can take place and, also, quite frankly I didn’t support that attempt to re-write history.

831,"Half of the borough councils in London use surveillance equipment linked to technology used by the Chinese Communist Party in the oppression and persecution of the Uighurs.Data obtained from a freedom of information request given to the Thomson Reuters Foundation revealed that at least half of London’s 32 local governing bodies were using surveillance systems from two Chinese companies, Hikvision and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co Ltd, which produce facial recognition technologies. Both firms are currently subject to restrictions in the United States.Hikvision provides video surveillance systems to police in Xinjiang, home to the Uighurs, where an estimated one to three million of the Muslim minority group are believed to be detained in the province’s more than 1,000 concentration camps.Digital rights researcher Samuel Woodhams, who handed the data to the news organisation, said of the findings: “We’re getting a clearer picture of just how pervasive these firms’ technology is in the UK — and how frequently public funds are being used to acquire it.”Hammersmith and Fulham, for example, have 1,790 Hikvision cameras at an estimated cost of £350,000 ($485,000).Local governments are responsible for purchasing and deploying surveillance equipment on the public streets of Britain. Mr Woodhams sent requests to London’s 32 boroughs and the UK’s 20 largest councils, finding two-thirds, including 16 London boroughs, of the total had purchased surveillance equipment from Dahua or Hikvision. In 2016, Hikvision was found to be the UK’s top provider of CCTV equipment.Three other national councils and six London boroughs did not respond to the FOI requests or claimed that they did not have the data, meaning that the true proportion of local governments in Britain’s capital which operates technology linked to the suppression of the Uighurs could be higher.Human Rights Abusing Chinese Surveillance Firm Blacklisted by Trump to be Promoted by UK https://t.co/5RhtLCN1jo— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2020Camden in London said it had a policy against using certain Chinese-origin surveillance technology, but the FOI request revealed the borough was using video recorders made by Hikvision.Councils were found to have bought cameras and other hardware, including recorders for storing data, but none said they were using either companies’ facial recognition technologies. However, owning other pieces of hardware means systems could be configured for facial recognition purposes, some councils admitted, with Mr Woodhams remarking: “Even if it’s (tech) not being used for the most intrusive capabilities at the moment, it wouldn’t be that much of a jump to do it.”Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: “It’s a problem for UK taxpayers to be funding firms that work hand in hand with the Chinese state, that do ethnic profiling, and enable what looks like ethnic cleansing … we can’t tolerate our own Chinese-built panopticon.”Ms Carlo warned that while there is an assumption that CCTV cameras are just passive recording devices, “we have to acknowledge is that it’s increasingly active surveillance”, adding: “We’re talking about analysing footage, profiling people, processing data.”Big Brother Watch added in a statement on social media: “Hikvision and Dahua CCTV has NO place in the UK — and banishing them should prompt a wider review of why the UK is one of the most widely and deeply CCTV-surveilled countries in the world.”REVEALED: Cambridge University and the BBC have become the latest British establishment institutions accused of working in step with China. https://t.co/I2f8lNBwwj— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 10, 2021Meanwhile, The Sun revealed that the Transport for London (TfL) group, which runs the capital’s bus, tube, and some train services, has a pension scheme which invests in Chinese firms linked to Uighur persecution, including Alibaba and Tencent.Alibaba, an Amazon-like online marketplace in China, produced a ‘Uighur Alert’ facial recognition system, while technology giant Tencent also reportedly developed a phone app which singles out the minority group.Shaun Bailey, the Conservative contender for mayor of London, told The Sun that it was “deeply upsetting that Sadiq Khan has allowed TfL’s pension fund to invest in companies that aid China’s human rights abuses.“We cannot stand by while genocide is being committed in Xinjiang and freedoms are being crushed in Hong Kong.“It’s time for Sadiq Khan to live up to his responsibilities.“He must detwin London from Beijing and disinvest TfL’s pension fund from companies involved in these crimes.”While London is not technically twinned with Beijing, it has partnered with global cities, including the Chinese capital and Shanghai.Mayor Khan’s office said that it is not involved in the pensions scheme but has met with the Pension Fund, which is independent of the mayor’s office and TfL, to urge it to “fully consider” human rights when making investments.Over a dozen British universities are reportedly under investigation by security services over their relationships with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which may have violated national security and human rights laws.  https://t.co/JPASmB4Fvn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021AsiaLondon / EuropeTechChinaChinese TurkestanEast TurkestanLondonsurveillancesurveillance stateUighursUnited KingdomUyghursXinjiang.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
832,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate.

The American president said that countries can no longer do the “bare minimum”, saying that nations must “rapidly accelerate emissions commitments, hold one another accountable, and increase ambitions”.Speaking on the effects of the Chinese coronavirus and echoing the language of the Great Reset, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “If anything good can possibly come from this tragedy, we have at least been given the chance to build a global recovery on new and green foundations, so that humanity can prosper without imperilling the planet.”“The shared goals of the UK’s presidency of the G7 are to help the world to build back better and build back greener after the pandemic and minimise the risk of a catastrophe like this happening again,” he added.Bojo calls Biden to plot 'Build Back Better', Green Agenda https://t.co/CVbm50ruLu— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 10, 2020The chummy relationship between Mr Biden and Mr Johnson was on full display when the British PM joked with the President that his campaign stole the British government’s slogan ‘build back better’.“I think he may have nicked it from us but I certainly nicked it from somewhere else — probably some UN disaster relief programme,” Mr Johnson admitted.It is not the first time Mr Biden has been accused of stealing rhetoric from across the pond, having famously ripped off his “thousand generations” speech from former Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock during his first presidential bid in 1988.The bid collapsed amidst the resulting plagiarism scandal.Though the slogan ‘Build Back Better’ was indeed used by United Nation following the 2011 Japanese tsunami, the phrase has increasingly been associated with the Great Reset agenda laid out by the World Economic Forum (WEF) which organises the elite Davos summits in Switzerland.Despite longstanding media narratives likening Boris Johnson to Donald Trump, the notionally conservative leader is in fact far more aligned on policy positions with neoliberals like Mr Biden, particularly in areas such as free trade, immigration, illegal alien amnesties, and climate change.While the relationship between the two leaders was reportedly tense over the issue of Joe Biden’s anti-Brexit attitude, the pair seem to have mended the ‘special relationship’, with the President expected to make his first international trip outside of North America to the United Kingdom for the G7 summit in June.A confidant of Mr Biden said in January that he will use the trip to plot “the destiny of the world” with Mr Johnson.Boris Johnson reportedly told Joe Biden that his ascendancy to the White House represented a “moment of hope in a dark time” as the leaders discussed their ‘Build Back Better’ agenda during a phone call on Saturday. https://t.co/njFiSkt61v— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 24, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaEnvironmentLondon / EuropePoliticsBoris JohnsonBuild Back BetterClimate ChangeDonald TrumpG7globalismGlobalistsGreat Resetgreen agendaJoe BidenMunich Security ConferenceParis Climate Accordspecial relationshipUK-U.S. relationsUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
835,"A healthy 32-year-old man was offered a priority coronavirus injection because his height was recorded as 6.2cm — a little over two inches.Liam Thorp, who stands six foot two inches tall, was listed as just 6.2cm by the National Health Service (NHS) database, giving him a body mass index (BMI) of 28,000. The NHS classifies anyone with a BMI of between 30 and 39.9 as obese, with anyone over that range as morbidly obese.With an obesity rate off the charts, Mr Thorpe was put on a priority list for vaccinations as he counted as medically vulnerable. The mix-up suggests the NHS system cannot provide feedback to staff when impossible data is entered.“Like most people, I’ve put on a few pounds in lockdown, but I was surprised to have made it all the way to the clinically, morbidly obese category,” Mr Thorpe told BBC Five Live on Thursday.“It really made me rethink what I was going to do for pancake night,” he added.Should they not have been in touch before to see how the man the size of a thumb was getting on?— Jennifer Williams (@JenWilliamsMEN) February 17, 2021It was only when Mr Thorp, the political editor at the Liverpool Echo, called his GP after getting the letter that the error was exposed and cleared.“This led to some serious soul-searching and a quickly revised schedule for Pancake Day (I opted for four instead of five),” Mr Thorp wrote of his experience before detailing what he described as “one of the more bizarre phone calls of my life”.The NHS staff member at the surgery told Thorp that his details had been put into the system incorrectly when he had registered with the GP last year.“I’m not sure how he kept it together when he told me that this, combined with my weight, had given me a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28,000,” he wrote in the Echo.“If I had been less stunned, I would have asked why no one was more concerned that a man of these remarkable dimensions was slithering around south Liverpool,” he said.Always a bit nervous when you get a 'no caller ID' ringing youIt's ok though, this was just a man ringing to tell me that I'm a morbidly obese pancake— Liam Thorp 💙 (@LiamThorpECHO) February 17, 2021HealthLondon / EuropecoronavirusUnited KingdomvaccinationWeird News.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

They also did not comment on the nationality of those detained, but confirmed all the suspects have permanent residency in Finland and that the migrants smuggled into Finland were primarily from the Middle East.The migrants believed to have entered the country at several different locations, including the land border in south-east Finland and by air to the Helsinki area.Finnish Police Bust Huge Sex Trafficking Ring Led by Migrants https://t.co/7TPBZXJhXL— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020Investigation Director Antti Leskela said the smuggling of illegals was not related to forced human trafficking, saying: “Of course, in such a situation, it is taken into account, but from the point of view of the investigation, there is no real reason to suspect human trafficking.”The raids come just weeks after it was revealed that Finland saw a record number of people seeking help over human trafficking issues in 2020, most of which involved trafficking victims forced to work in various industries.Terhi Tafari, a senior advisor at the anti-trafficking centre, claimed that potentially thousands of people had been brought to Finland for forced labour.In recent months, several other migrant trafficking networks have been dismantled, including a large network in France that was believed to have played a major part in illegal crossings across the English Channel last year.ImmigrationLaw and OrderLondon / EuropeFinlandIllegal Migrantsillegal migrationMass MigrationPeople smugglerspeople smugglingraid.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
837,"An anti-lockdown MP proposed reducing political salaries in solidarity with ordinary Canadians forced onto benefit payments by the government’s pandemic response, only to have the bill rejected and the legislature vote to reduce his salary instead.Ontario member of the provincial parliament (MPP) Roman Baber introduced a bill in the Ontario parliament this week to reduce MPP salaries to $500 a week, the amount given to Canadians under the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). This ‘We Are All in This Together Act’, he said, would give lawmakers an incentive to end lockdown by leaving them in the same situation as the public.Baber’s private members’ bill was rejected but was countered by Progressive Conservative group government leader Paul Calandra, who put forward a motion to reduce just Baber’s salary to the $500 a week level instead. The proposal to target only the anti-lockdown member of the Ontario parliament passed with the unanimous consent, the Toronto Star reports.“The government is quick to shut down the economy, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers on Employment Insurance. The unemployment rate is almost double and more than 400,000 Ontarians remain unemployed compared to pre-pandemic levels,” Baber said.In Pictures: Ten Arrested During Toronto Lockdown Protests https://t.co/bf6pISB8uJ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 25, 2021While the original bill would have cut Ontario MPP salaries from $2,240 per week to just $500, the counter motion would not have any effect according to the Ontario speaker Ted Arnott, who stated that only legislative statues can change Ontario MPP salaries.“It’s easy to pass laws that destroy people’s livelihoods when you’re on government salary. My PMB will encourage MPPs to fully appreciate the consequences of their actions, when many Ontarians can’t afford to put food on the table,” Baber added.Baber also criticised Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who removed Baber from the Progressive Conservative caucus last month after Baber publicly declared his opposition to the Wuhan coronavirus lockdowns enacted by the Ford government.“The lockdowns aren’t working,” Baber wrote in an open letter to the Ford government and added, “They are killing lives instead of saving lives. I plead with you to accept this reality and end the lockdown.”The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) also criticised Baber who cited the rise in “thoughts of feelings of suicide” during the pandemic, claiming that the rise was linked to the pandemic itself and not the lockdown measures implemented by the government as Baber had suggested.BBQ Rebellion: Restaurant Owner Arrested After Days of Defying Toronto Lockdown https://t.co/WHfTN07lke— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 27, 2020Baber is not the first anti-lockdown critic to fall foul of the Ford government in recent months. Restaraunt owner Adam Skelly, the owner of Adamson Barbeque, was arrested after defying lockdown measures by allowing indoor dinging for several days in November.Initially, Premier Ford expressed sympathy for struggling small business owners but changed his attitude as Skelly’s protest continued saying, “You’re putting people’s lives in jeopardy. I always try to be nice the first time, but this guy is just totally ignoring public health officials.”Some of who have attempted to protest the lockdowns in Toronto have also been arrested by police in recent weeks and late last month the Ontario government deployed 50 inspectors to large retailers and fined those who did not comply with mask and social distancing rules.HealthLondon / EuropePoliticsCanadacoronavirusDoug FordontarioRoman Baber.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
838,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been accused of moving the goalposts amidst reports that the British government will not lift lockdown restrictions until cases fall below 1,000 per day.Mr Johnson is set to announce a “roadmap” to end the lockdown next week, with schools expected to reopen on March 8th. However, the plan is not likely to include any firm dates as to when life can return to normality in the United Kingdom.A senior Whitehall source told the Daily Telegraph: “For any significant relaxation of lockdown, household mixing and reopening pubs, case numbers have to be in the hundreds, not thousands.“The numbers are coming down quite fast, but the plan is likely to be high level and set out the tests that have to be met for restrictions to be released. There is real reluctance about committing to specific dates without knowing what the case numbers are doing.”Senior Tories expressed concern that the government is once again trying to move the goalposts as the initial justification for the lockdown — to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed — has seemingly been sidelined in favour of reducing cases.The chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbench MPs, Sir Graham Brady, said: “The case for the current lockdown was made on the grounds that NHS ICU [intensive care unit] capacity was about to be overwhelmed.“Now the picture is profoundly different. All of the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. Positive test numbers, hospitalisations, deaths are all falling rapidly.“The presumption should be that people are given back control over their own lives and we move from a world of arbitrary regulation to one where we are able to take responsibility for ourselves and each other. We cannot allow the goalposts to be moved every time we are about to reach freedom.”Boris Wants ‘This Lockdown to Be the Last’, But Wouldn’t Rule out a Fourth https://t.co/KJ0rBoHjVn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021Amid one of the more successful vaccination rollouts in the world, in which over 16 million people have been inoculated, including nearly everyone over the age of 70, Chinese coronavirus cases have fallen from a height of over 68,000 on January 8th to just above 10,000 per day as of Tuesday.If the government does commit to reducing cases to bellow 1,000 per day, it would mean that infections would need to fall to levels not seen since last August.Coronavirus deaths have also steeply declined in recent weeks, with deaths of people over the age of 80 falling by 53 per cent from January 28th to February 11th, as well as a 44 per cent drop for under-80s, according to an analysis conducted by the BBC.On Tuesday, Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi refused to say what number of cases per day would be deemed sufficient for the government lockdown to end.“The Prime Minister is right to say that where we are today in terms of number of people in hospital, in terms of case numbers per day, is still far too high, and we want to make sure we bring that right down. But I wouldn’t want to speculate on this until we see more data,” he told Sky News.The government has also announced that it has added 1.7 million people to the so-called ‘shielding list’, meaning that they may be asked to refrain from re-entering society even when the lockdown is lifted.Delingpole: Britain Is Now a Tyranny.

At that time, there were several violent confrontations between the two organizations.Berlin police said in addition to their own SWAT teams and other personnel, federal agents, Brandenburg police and tax officials were involved in the raids, more than 500 personnel in all.Arab Refugees in Sights of Berlin’s Notorious Crime ‘Clans’ https://t.co/alkI9QIKeZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 18, 2018Authorities did not immediately provide further details, but the Bild newspaper reported that one of the targets was the Remmo family, which has alleged links to two recent spectacular heists.Two of the main suspects in the 2019 theft of 18th-century jewels from a Dresden museum last year are part of the family, which has ties to Beirut.Mohamed Remmo, 21, was arrested by Berlin authorities in December in connection with the Green Vault Museum theft, while his twin brother, Abdul Majed Remmo, is being sought on an international warrant.Other members of the Remmo family were convicted last year for a similarly spectacular heist, the theft of a 100-kilogram (220 pound) Canadian gold coin dubbed the “Big Maple Leaf” from Berlin´s Bode Museum in 2017.The coin, with an estimated value of 3.75 million euros ($4.45 million) has not yet been recovered and authorities think it was likely cut up into smaller pieces and sold off.CrimeLaw and OrderLondon / EuropeBerlinChechnyaGermanyPolice.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

842,"A jailed far-right nail bomber who had said he wanted to start a “racial war” has allegedly converted to Islam in prison, reportedly asking to be called “Saddam” in admiration of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.David Copeland, 44, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2000 and must serve at least 50 years for his 13-day nail-bombing campaign in 1999, during which in three separate attacks he targetted London’s Bangladeshi, black, and LGBT communities. In total, his devices injured 139 people, and his final bomb, planted at the Admiral Duncan gay bar, killed three people including a pregnant woman.Fellow former inmate Andy Ross, who has since completed his sentence for armed robbery, told The Sun on Monday that Copeland, who had said he wanted to “set fire to the country and stir up a racial war”, had converted to Islam in the hopes of being “re-born in a different body after death”.He also allegedly told other prisoners at Her Majesty’s Prison (HMP) Frankland that he wanted to be called “Saddam”.“Copeland prays every day and sees practising as a Muslim as a way of getting forgiveness and changing. But he still has a twisted mind,” Mr Ross told the newspaper.Copeland was also sentenced in 2015 for the brutal attack on another prisoner using a shiv, specifically a toothbrush modified with razer blades, while serving time at HMP Belmarsh in London.He is now residing at the high-security Frankland prison in Durham, a jail home to other high-profile prisoners, including Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe until his death from coronavirus in November.Streatham Terrorist Told Fellow Inmate He Wanted to Kill a Politician https://t.co/2dqYE2Zdmz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 4, 2020The prison had also hosted Islamist terrorist Michael Adebolajo, who along with Michael Adebowale murdered and attempted to behead Fusilier Lee Rigby near Woolwich barracks in May 2014.Just three years later, sources at Frankland claimed that Adebolajo had groomed other inmates who then converted to Islam and were radicalised under the terrorist’s influence, some swearing allegiance to Islamic State and pledging to commit attacks upon release.Frankland was also the first prison to have a purpose-build extremists’ unit, to keep Islamists away from the regular prison population and stop them from attracting recruits.A Ministry of Justice 2019 report revealed that Muslim prison gangs were forcibly converting non-Muslim inmates under the threat of violence. A Christian chaplain claimed the year before that some convert for protection.While a 2015 Prison Officer’s Association report claimed non-Muslim inmates were being forced to pay a “protection” tax, or “jizya”, if they did not convert.However, prison officers have claimed some inmates have become “convenience Muslims to play the system”, including to gain access to better food.Despite three ‘jihadi jails’ opening in recent years, only one — Frankland — remains open, meaning that just three per cent of Islamist extremists have been isolated to stop them influencing or threatening other prisoners.Just Three Per Cent of Jailed Jihadists Are Isolated to Stop Them Radicalising Other Inmates: Report https://t.co/FRr3eTo7wv— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 20, 2021London / EuropeIslamMuslim convertprisonUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

This should be embedded throughout our education system,” she had said.Elsewhere in Scotland, the University of Edinburgh announced on Tuesday that it will launch a review of its buildings for their connections to the slave trade. The university said that it will audit the school’s “relationship with its past” in order to align more with the diversity of the student body.“The process will be highly consultative with students, staff, alumni and wider relevant stakeholders asked to take part. It will remain open to the widest possible sources of information and viewpoints,” a spokesman from the university claimed.Last year, Edinburgh University removed the name of 18th century Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume from one of its buildings over his now politically incorrect opinions on race.The woke purge has extended throughout British academia, heritage bodies, and museums alike. In August, for example, the British Museum removed the bust of its founder, Sir Hans Sloane, from its pedestal amid BLM-inspired outrage over his ties to the slave trade.The Natural History Museum followed suit, launching a review into supposedly “offensive” and “problematic” collections, including exotic birds collected by English naturalist Charles Darwin.British Library Boss Claims 'Racism Is a Creation of White People', Demands 'Decolonisation' https://t.co/OqjfXvtsqQ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 30, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeacademiaBritish EmpireBritish HistoryColonial GuiltGlasgow universityHeritageIconoclasmleft-wing academicsleft-wing educationMuseummuseumsscotlandUnited KingdomUniversity of EdinburghUniversity of Glasgow.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
846,"Security guards at an English supermarket called the police on a disabled man who refused to wear a yellow sticker exempting him from wearing a mask.Since Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the first police-enforced lockdown on March 23rd, 2020, Britons have subjected to overzealous policing of their activities and a suppression of their freedoms.After British supermarkets made mask-wearing mandatory, security guards have taken to demanding shoppers cover their face before entering or be banned. Those with disabilities, young children, or others with exemptions do not have to wear one. But some supermarkets offer lanyards or badges to designate those that they deem can enter their stores with their faces uncovered.The Sun reported on Wednesday the case of man, who said he was disabled, being threatened with police action unless he wore a yellow exemption badge to reassure other shoppers.Footage shared on social media showed him being confronted by two security guards, one appearing to call the police, with the shopper helpfully offering she call the non-emergency number, 111, rather than 999, whose operators he said would not be “happy” to be bothered with a non-emergency call.“I’m not conforming to no sticker laws. Sorry,” the shopper said, noting that the requirement to wear such a mark was not law, calling the shop’s policy “totalitarian”.When the male guard told him it was to “explain” to other people that he was exempt, the shopper responded: “I shouldn’t need to explain. I’ve got a medical exemption. That should be enough. I shouldn’t have to declare my medical exemption. That’s a Discrimination Act thing.”UK Police Apologise After Covid Cop Called Man ‘Idiot’ and Wrongly Detained Him https://t.co/X16qaPz3gG— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2021“If they ask me, I can tell them. I don’t need a sticker. I’m perfectly capable of communicating with somebody,” he added, as the female guard walked off, apparently to call the police.Morrison’s, one of the largest supermarkets in the UK, apologised to the man, saying there was no policy forcing someone with an exemption to wear a mask. However, it reiterated that it would ban shoppers without exemptions who refuse to wear one.Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a rise in police, politicians, and members of the public backing a hard crackdown on supposed lockdown rule-breakers.Police have also shared stories on social media of them punishing or shaming rule-breakers with some relish, including when they cracked down on rural dog walkers and fined a man for going to his friend’s house for a cup of tea.UK police have also busted baptisms, women’s dinner parties, and harassed shopkeepers over the sale of chocolate Easter eggs which officers claimed were ‘non-essential’.British police could not have done it without the help of citizens, however.Government ministers calling on Britons to inform on their neighbours if they suspected them of breaking social distancing rules led to incidents including one woman calling the police on a funeral wake in a pub garden because she thought people were standing too close to each other.The woman, who had shot footage of the wake from quite some distance, had claimed it was her “public duty” to inform on the mourners.""The coronavirus pandemic is turning sections of the populace into tinpot fascists I call #CovidNazis,"" writes @JamesDelingpole https://t.co/8vutimK3Ue— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 26, 2020Law and OrderLondon / EuropeSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19maskPolicestickerSupermarketUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

This is a man I met on the Internet. He lived in Africa, in Dakar. I fell in love. He wanted me to marry him in Senegal. I went there, and we got married,” Catherine told broadcaster Europe1.The couple lived with Catherine’s parents, to begin with, and according to the 36-year-old, her husband became verbally and physically abusive privately but put on an act when her parents were present.Civil Servant Suspected of Arranging Marriages to Keep Migrants in France https://t.co/BukeD41vVA— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 31, 2019“It’s very demeaning to feel used.

I knew he would send money there every month, but he told me it was for his mother. It was a huge amount of money,” she said.“He never managed to get his wife and children to come to France because I always refused to start the process for him to obtain French citizenship.

Maybe you could fall in love with someone who doesn’t have the right to stay here? Could happen, right? Stay open,” the group wrote on social media.That same year in France, a city project manager in Villepinte was accused of arranging sham marriages for migrants and was thought to be involved in at least a dozen such fake marriages.ImmigrationLondon / EuropeAfrican migrantsCitizenshipFrancemarriagescamsSenegalsham marriages.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
848,"A government scientific advisor has said that vaccination numbers are looking “so good”, there’s hope of lifting lockdown early.The UK has vaccinated some 17 million people and could have given both doses of the vaccines to all adults by August or September. With far greater vaccine success than on the continent, at one point during last week the UK had given the first dose to more people than the entire EU27 combined.Professor Mark Woolhouse, who belongs to a subgroup of the influential Scientific Advisory Committee on Emergencies (SAGE), told the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday: “If you’re driven by data and not the dates, right now you should be looking at early unlocking because the data are so good.”“The vaccination rollout is I think exceeding most people’s expectations,” Professor Woolhouse said, according to LBC.The University of Edinburgh epidemiologist remarked on the “actual performance of the vaccine”, saying that both the numbers related to the “transmission-blocking potential” and the “actual ability to protect against death and disease and to keep people out of hospital” looked “really good”.Boris Wants ‘This Lockdown to Be the Last’, But Wouldn’t Rule out a Fourth https://t.co/KJ0rBoHjVn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021The member of SAGE’s Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) also said that the government was slow to ease lockdown last March, owing to a lack of confidence in the scientific data, particularly with regards to reopening schools and outdoor sporting.“I think we probably could have considered reopening schools much sooner in the first lockdown,” he said.Professor Woolhouse continued: “The other thing, quite clearly, is outdoor activities. Again, there was evidence going back to March and April that the virus is not transmitted well outdoors.“There’s been very, very little evidence that any transmission outdoors is happening in the UK.“Those two things, I think, could have been relaxed sooner in the first lockdown.”He also confirmed that there had been no outbreaks linked to crowded beaches, giving fresh hope to Britons hoping at least for a holiday in the UK, even if international travel is banned.Woolhouse said: “Over the summer, we were treated to all this on the television news and pictures of crowded beaches and there was an outcry about this.“There were no outbreaks linked to crowded beaches. There’s never been a Covid-19 outbreak linked to a beach ever anywhere in the world to the best of my knowledge.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been accused of moving the goalposts amidst reports that the British government will not lift lockdown restrictions until cases fall below 1,000 per day. https://t.co/gk2deooigD— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2021Whitehall sources told media on Wednesday that in order for there to be any significant easing of lockdown measures, recorded cases of the Chinese virus would have to fall from the current rate of some 10,000 to the hundreds.Chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady accused the government of moving the goalposts over what conditions lockdown would be lifted, since when the prime minister first outlined a fall in hospitalisations, deaths, and a successful vaccine system when declaring the lockdown on January 4th.Brady said: “Now the picture is profoundly different. All of the most vulnerable groups have been vaccinated. Positive test numbers, hospitalisations, deaths are all falling rapidly.“The presumption should be that people are given back control over their own lives, and we move from a world of arbitrary regulation to one where we are able to take responsibility for ourselves and each other. We cannot allow the goalposts to be moved every time we are about to reach freedom.”On Monday, the prime minister said that he wanted this lockdown — England’s third — to be the last, but would not commit to ruling out a fourth in the future.Ministers Pressuring Boris to Reconsider Immunity Certificates for Domestic Use: Report https://t.co/H5ZhGSzf86— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2021HealthLondon / EuropePoliticscoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownSAGEUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
849,"Parents will be expected to test secondary school children, aged 11 to 18, twice a week under government plans to reopen schools from next month, according to reports.The government is set to have agreed on a compromise with schools unions in the plans after the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) dismissed suggestions schools become “field hospitals” responsible for the regular testing of older pupils.Sources speaking to The Telegraph on Wednesday said that while secondary schools will conduct the first round of mass-testing as part of their staggered reopening, parents will be required to conduct bi-weekly testing of their children thereafter.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce his “roadmap” for loosening England’s third lockdown on Monday. He is expected to announce that children may return to school from March 8th, with secondary schools allowed to reintroduce classes to groups in phases to allow schools to manage the first lot of testing.Parents would reportedly be using the lateral flow tests, which involve taking a swab from the nose or the back of the throat near the tonsils. Unlike the PCR test, it does not need to go to a laboratory for processing, and results are visible after 30 minutes.Masks will also be mandatory in secondary schools in places where social distancing is not possible outside of classroom ‘bubbles’.‘No Jab, No Job’ – UK Firms Set to Make Vaccines Mandatory https://t.co/kQpRm0vgWe— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2021Care Minister Helen Whately would not confirm whether the Telegraph report was true, only telling Sky News on Thursday that “next week, more will be set out about how the return to school is going to work.”Mrs Whately, however, later suggested that testing of children would be part of the plans to reopen schools, telling the BBC: “There is work being done to look at how testing will help schools come back. But there will be more details set out about that next week.”When schools reopened in September after the summer holidays, following several months of disruption after the beginning of the outbreak of Chinese coronavirus in the UK, schools introduced temperature-checking at the gates. Some demanded children wear masks and carry their own hand sanitiser. Others also segregated playtime between the year groups and enforced strict “no touching” rules.The British government has been criticised in recent months for its handling of schooling since the beginning of the pandemic, notably with regards to supporting poorer children after it was revealed that contractors were sending massively inadequate food parcels to families of children who would ordinarily receive free schools lunches, worth a fraction of what taxpayers were paying for them.On Thursday, the Daily Mail reported on the cost of lockdown to children, claiming that pupils in England will have lost some 850 million hours of face-to-face classroom teaching by the time schools reopen on March 8th.A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies from earlier this month calculated that school closures due to lockdown, which resulted in two years of exams being cancelled, could cost each pupil up to £40,000 in lost income throughout their lifetimes unless there is a concerted effort to catch children up on months of lost learning.Police Called on Disabled Man Who Didn’t Wear ‘Mask Exempt’ Yellow Badge https://t.co/ondTx9OEGF— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 18, 2021EducationLondon / EuropeSciencecoroanvirusCoronavirus testingCOVID-19pandemicschoolsUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
850,"Between 2014 and 2020, the number of children reported being exploited and sold by sex traffickers in France increased by 600 per cent, according to the country’s human trafficking agency.The French Central Office for the Suppression of Human Trafficking (OCRTEH) revealed that the number of minors reported as being exploited as child prostitutes was 28 in 2014, but the number rose to 198 in 2020, representing a 600 per cent increase in just six years.One of the areas in which the number of child prostitution cases has especially multiplied in recent years is Lille, where prosecutor Carole Étienne has said the figures should act as a “wake-up call” for authorities, Actu reports.Earlier this month, the city saw the latest case involving two young men involved in a sex trafficking network that included children.One-Third of Young Prostitutes in Paris No-Go Suburbs Under 15-Years-Old https://t.co/XGzxmt0n7z— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 13, 2019One man was accused of taking pictures of the girls and using them to advertise their services on social media, while the other is accused of providing security for the young victims.Prosecutor Carole Étienne said: “In 2020, of the pimping cases we had to deal with, there were 33 victims and 22 were minors. It’s a wake-up call I want to push.”“They are often vulnerable, struggling people between the ages of 14 and 17, on the run,” Étienne said. She added: “We see a trivialisation of pimping and prostitution among young people, to finance a lifestyle.”Several other cases of child prostitution made headlines last year in France, including a report from Dijon in which a judge was accused of pimping out his 12-year-old daughter to other men through an online dating website.In 2019, the Observatory of Violence Against Women in Seine-Saint-Denis published a report claiming that around a third of the underage prostitutes in Paris’s no-go suburbs were under the age of 15 and that some were as young as just six years old.French Judge Arrested for Attempting to Prostitute 12-Year-Old Daughter Online https://t.co/le3PRFnp6O— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 14, 2020Law and OrderLondon / Europechild abusechild exploitationchild prostitutionchild sex traffickingFranceLilleSex Trafficking.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

The Black community in Ottawa makes up seven per cent of the general population, but accounts for 37 per cent of COVID-19 cases,” the committee said.The move to prioritise vaccinations based on race comes after the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced other racially-based policies in recent months.In September, the Trudeau administration announced a plan to invest $221 million (£159 million) of taxpayer money into a programme to give loans to black entrepreneurs.

852,"The British government is planning on requiring voter ID for elections by the year 2023, in one of the biggest reforms to the electoral system in recent memory, a report claims.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is set to require that voters present some form of identification, such as a driving licence, passport, or even library card at the polls, fulfilling a manifesto pledge from the Conservative Party ahead of the last general election.The requirement will be folded into the government’s planned Electoral Integrity Bill, which The Sun reported will be introduced to the parliament in the coming months and is expected to be in place before the 2023 elections.Under the current system, voters are merely asked to provide their name and address, without any verification, before they are allowed to vote. Ministers hope that a voter ID will give the public greater confidence in the electoral process.A Cabinet Office spokesperson told the paper: “We will be introducing new measures, as part of the Government’s manifesto commitment, to prevent the potential for voter fraud in our electoral system.“This will further strengthen the integrity of UK elections and will include ID checks at the polling station and rules that prevent abuse of postal and proxy votes.”The list of identification documents will also reportedly include documents such as library cards in order to prevent lower-income people from being stripped of the franchise, given there is a nominal fee associated with acquiring a learner’s driving licence or a passport.Those who have no form of identification at all will be able to contact their local council prior to election day to verify their identity and receive a free form of ID.Poll: Majority of Britons Support Voter ID Law https://t.co/i5KMfP8YWG— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2019During a series of ten “voter ID pilots” conducted by the government across England in the 2019 May elections, less than one per cent of voters were turned away for lack of proper identification.Yet, the Labour Party — like the Democrat Party in America — is firmly opposed to any such measures, claiming that voter ID requirements are racist and tantamount to voter suppression.Labour’s Shadow Minister for Democracy, Cat Smith said: “It doesn’t matter how the government dresses it up, these plans will make it harder for working-class, older and Black people to vote.“Giving people a say at the ballot box helps make our democratic country what it is, and we must not do anything to undermine that.”In response to the claims of racism from the Labour Party, a senior fellow at the Policy Exchange think tank and political commentator Calvin Robinson, told Breitbart London that he finds it “incredibly patronising of them to use black people as an excuse.”“To suggest voter ID would discriminate against black people is essentially the Left saying black people aren’t capable of obtaining ID. I find that implication incredibly offensive,” he said. Mr Robinson, who has himself been the target of left-wing racism and even called a “race traitor” for publicly expressing conservative views, added that the issue of voter ID “exposes the double standards of many on the Left.”“We’re seeing calls for vaccine passports, restricting people’s freedoms and access to everyday services until they receive a mandatory vaccination. At the same time, they insist it’s discriminatory to implement voter ID regulations.“Surely both positions can’t hold true unless they’re admitting to wanting to discriminate against some individuals but not others,” Robinson noted.“If voter ID would help prevent voter fraud, why wouldn’t Labour want to implement it? That’s a question I hope many Labour voters are asking,” he concluded.‘Safe and Secure’?

854,"MADRID (AP) – More than 50 people were arrested and dozens injured during a second night of protests that turned violent in several Spanish cities. The protests were sparked by the imprisonment of a rapper who had insulted the monarchy and praised terrorism.The protests began peacefully late Wednesday in dozens of Spanish provincial capitals and other towns in the northeastern Catalonia region, home to the rapper Pablo Hasél. But as the evening wore on they turned violent, with rioting, impromptu barricades made from trash containers and fires, and damage to shops.In Madrid, Barcelona and smaller cities, anti-riot police fired rubber or foam bullets at baton-charged protesters, who threw objects at officers and set trash containers alight. Some used overturned motorbikes to block streets.Police officers take position next to a barricade during clashes following a protest condemning the arrest of rap singer Pablo Hasél in Barcelona, Spain, Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021.

Emergency services assisted 35 injured anti-riot officers and 20 others, including protesters and people who passed by and were caught in the melee.In Barcelona, 29 people were arrested and at least eight were injured and sent to hospitals, the regional emergency service said Thursday. The night before, a young protester lost an eye night as a result of a foam projectile used by the regional Mossos d´Esquadara police to dispel the protesters.At least four protesters were also arrested Wednesday in the southern city of Granada.Some of the gravest riots on Wednesday night took place near the Lleida prison, where Hasél was taken Tuesday. Police arrested him at a university building where he had barricaded himself 24 hours earlier to draw attention to his arrest.The rapper and his supporters say that Hasél’s nine-month sentence for writing a critical song about former King Juan Carlos I and dozens of tweets that judges said glorified some of Spain’s extinct terrorist groups violates free speech rights.A man reacts next to burning motorcycles during clashes following a protest condemning the arrest of rap singer Pablo Hasél in Barcelona, Spain, Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021.

(AP Photo/Felipe Dana)Before that case, the rapper had been given a suspended two-year sentence and faced other charges for assault, praising armed extremist groups, breaking into private premises and insulting the monarchy.His legal situation has drawn considerable public attention because it comes on the back of a string of other artists and social media personalities that have been put on trial for violating Spain’s 2015 Public Security Law, which was enacted by a previous conservative-led government and criticized by human rights organizations.Spain´s left-wing coalition government wants to change the country´s criminal code to eliminate prison terms for offenses involving freedom of speech, especially when it comes in the form of artistic expression. The junior member of the coalition, the far-left United We Can (Unidas Podemos) party, has said it will work to grant a pardon to Hasél.The riots have led to a new political storm, with the opposition lambasting United We Can for not expressing a strong condemnation of the street violence. Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, a member of the center-left Socialists leading the ruling coalition, criticized United We Can spokesman Pablo Echenique for showing support for the “antifascist protesters fighting for freedom of expression.”People gather next to a burning barricade during clashes after a protest condemning the arrest of rap singer Pablo Hasél in Barcelona, Spain, Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021.

That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
857,"Companies in Britain have been tasking law firms to craft “no jab, no job” contracts that would bar prospective employees from being hired unless they have been vaccinated against the Chinese coronavirus.While the government has publicly claimed that it has no intentions of requiring domestic vaccine passports, ministers have admitted that private businesses may take up the mantle of imposing it on the British public.Speaking to the Financial Times, law firms said that they have already been contacted by companies, including care homes and multinational corporations, which are looking to draw up contracts that would require employees to be inoculated against the virus.One unnamed attorney told the paper that such requirements could be risky as they might trigger discrimination claims from people who refuse to take the vaccine on religious grounds, pregnant women, or those who have health conditions, such as allergies, which prevent them from taking the jab.The lawyer did note that in sectors in which employees are surrounded by at-risk people, such as in care homes, so-called “no jab, no job” contracts may ultimately be defensible.Some of the law firms contacted claimed that businesses have also begun inquiring about how to require that those already employed receive the vaccine.However, companies seeking to change the contracts of people already employed would need to gain the consent of the worker, a partner at the law firm Lewis Silkin, James Davies, cautioned.The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that there was no justification for businesses to require vaccines for employees, saying that mass testing would be a preferable option.The chief executive of the human resource firm CIPD, Peter Cheese, said: “The UK government hasn’t made the vaccine compulsory, so neither can employers.”Mr Cheese added: “Nor should they be restricting people coming into work based on whether they have had the vaccine.”Ministers Pressuring Boris to Reconsider Immunity Certificates for Domestic Use: Report https://t.co/H5ZhGSzf86— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2021On Tuesday, Britain’s vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi said: “It’s up to businesses what they do, but we don’t yet have the evidence of the effect of vaccines on transmission.”Zahawi had previously said that such a scheme would be wrong and discriminatory.On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the use of vaccine passports on a domestic level is being considered by the government in such places as supermarkets.In January, the anti-Brexit founder of Pimlico Plumbers announced that he would be requiring his employees to be vaccinated, boldly pronouncing “no vaccine, no job”.Charlie Mullins said that he will make it “standard” in employment contracts that “you’re required to have a vaccine”, saying: “We won’t be employing people in the future unless they’ve got a vaccine.”Barchester Healthcare, which operates over 200 care homes, has also said that it will refuse to hire people who fail to vaccinate.Boris Johnson Admits Vaccine Passports Will Become ‘Inevitable’ https://t.co/XZheMME56H— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaEconomyHealthLondon / EuropeBritish EconomycoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid Vaccinehealth passportimmunity passportUK economyUnited KingdomVaccinevaccine passportVaccine Passports.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
858,"Government ministers are reportedly pressuring Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reconsider his personal objections to the introduction of immunity certificates for domestic use, which the senior MPs claim could help save the hospitality and entertainment industries.In the past week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has confirmed that the government is in negotiations with other countries on vaccine passports to reopen avenues for international travel after countries like Greece and Denmark announced they were looking into similar schemes.While Prime Minister Johnson admitted on Monday that such documentation will “inevitably” come into play, he remained opposed to the prospect of immunity certificates for domestic use such as for going to the cinema or the pub.Sources speaking to The Times, however, said that ministers are working on changing the prime minister’s mind, acknowledging that while he may remain against the idea, businesses, particularly those badly effective by the lockdowns, may demand them from customers as condition of entry.“We’re talking about industries that are dying here. In terms of getting live music, theatre and other parts of the entertainment industry back on their feet, it seems an obvious thing to do once the majority of people have been vaccinated,” a senior minister told the newspaper of record on Wednesday.Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that the government was “not planning a domestic passport”, however, seniors’ care homes, schools, and cinemas are said to be amongst the groups calling for their implementation.Mr Zahawi admitted that “it’s up to businesses what they do”. The vaccine minister had before said that while the UK would not force people to take the vaccination, many businesses may demand proof of immunity before entry and that the government may enable such schemes through government-run systems like the NHS’s test and trace app.Boris Johnson Admits Vaccine Passports Will Become ‘Inevitable’ https://t.co/XZheMME56H— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021For months, the Conservative government has given mixed messages on vaccine passports or immunity certificates. While Mr Johnson expressed his opposition to immunity certificates for domestic use, he admitted on Monday that nightclubs, pubs, and other hospitality venues could demand proof of vaccination.“I think that will be the route that we go down and that businesses will go down,” the prime minister said on Monday, adding: “You are already seeing lots of business using the potential of rapid, on-the-day testing as well. I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward.”On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab suggested that immunity certificates may be needed even to go into the supermarket, telling LBC that the idea “hasn’t been ruled out and it’s under consideration, but of course you’ve got to make it workable”.“Whether it’s at an international, domestic or local level, you’ve got to know that the document being presented is something that you can rely on and that it’s an accurate reflection of the status of the individual,” Mr Raab added.Anti-Brexit plumbing mogul Charlie Mullins announced in January a “no vaccine, no jobs” policy and while an employment lawyer at the time said that the move would be illegal, government sources later told the media that employers might have the right to fire staff who refuse the vaccine — on the grounds of health and safety — unless they have a medical reason exempting them.Analysis by The Times on Wednesday said that the law on immunity certificates was “opaque” and while ministers may brand them “discriminatory”, other employment lawyers disagree.Sky News reported on Wednesday that every adult could receive both doses of the vaccine by August or September. So far, 15 million people have been vaccinated in the UK, including everyone in the top four tiers of vulnerability.Mr Johnson is also said to be preparing mass testing ahead of any lockdown restriction easing, including testing people who have shown no signs of the virus.Vaccine Passports Could be Used in Supermarkets Suggests UK Foreign Secretary https://t.co/I6BWrbvLZd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19immunity passportlockdownpandemicUnited KingdomVaccinationsvaccine passportvaccines.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
859,"The Chinese state overtook the United States as the European Union’s top trading partner in 2020, as ties between Brussels and the communist dictatorship in Beijing continue to deepen.During the year in which the coronavirus pandemic was inflicted upon the world through the ineptitude and malevolence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), imports from China to the European Union rose by 5.6 per cent and exports of EU goods to China climbed by 2.2 per cent.At the same time, trade between the European bloc and the United States fell dramatically, in part due to the Chinese coronavirus hampering transatlantic trade. Imports of American goods to the EU fell by a staggering 13.2 per cent, while European exports to the U.S. fell by 8.2 per cent, a report from Eurostat revealed.The shift in trade reliance means that for the first time, China has topped America as the EU’s chief trading partner, with €586 billion ($709bn/£510bn) exchanged in trade between the bloc and China last year, compared to €555 billion ($672bn/£483bn) in trade with the United States.European Union leaders are typically reticent to be overly critical of the CCP, yet they did not shy away from criticising the ‘America First’ trade war carried out by the Trump administration against China, which to date has been one of the more aggressive actions taken against the communist government by any American president.Conversely, EU leaders celebrated the election of Democrat President Joe Biden, who is widely regarded as more friendly towards the Chinese state and whose family has been accused of profiting off of business relationships with CCP connected firms.The increasingly close relationship between Brussels and Beijing has, however, begun to draw considerable backlash.Merkel Makes Clear That Germany Will Not Help U.S. in China Trade Fight https://t.co/mD8I0wy1gu— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 17, 2020Speaking with Breitbart London on Tuesday, the chairman of the Bow Group, Ben Harris-Quinney said: “The EU presents itself as the global arbiter of the ‘rules-based system’, yet they wasted no time in repudiating the democratic decisions of Brexit and Trump as a debasement of their ideal rules, criticising the rise of what they describe as ‘dangerous populism’.”“They, however, have very little to say on how China is run, and what are very apparent human rights abuses,” he said, adding that therefore it is “no surprise” that trade has ramped up .The head of the UK’s oldest conservative think tank pointed to the Paris Climate Accords — which America left under the leadership of former President Trump, only to be rejoined under the Biden administration — as another example of European hypocrisy.Mr Harris-Quinney noted that under the agreement “the West is required to dismantle its industry, but China is allowed to continue to increase industrial development and pollution,” adding that “this unchecked hypocrisy and baffling lack of statecraft” from European leaders have “allowed China to rise and the West to fall.”The Bow Group chairman said that China’s industrial might is reliant upon trade with Western nations, saying that despite the EU’s penchant for trade rules and regulations, the bloc has given the Chinese dictatorship a pass on its unfair trade practices and human rights abuses.“At a minimum, it is high time they at least apply the same basic human rights requirements to China as their other major trading partners in return for so much trade. It seems likely however that EU rules will continue to be for thee, but not for Xi,” Harris-Quinney concluded.Farage: European Union’s Greed Is Helping Communist China ‘Take Over the World’ https://t.co/VQphKAACee— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 7, 2021Trade between China and the European Union is likely to continue rising, with negotiators agreeing in principle to an investment pact in December that would see an increase of €120 billion in trade.The EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) — which was hastily signed before the inauguration of Democrat Joe Biden, representing one of the first diplomatic challenges for the incoming administration — has been characterised by the EU as the “most ambitious agreement that China has ever concluded with a third country”.While the bloc has touted that it has achieved alleged “concessions'” from the communist regime, the EU has failed to require that the Chinese government stamp out modern slavery, in places such as the concentration camp province of Xijiang, as a prerequisite for the agreement. Within the deal, Beijing conceded to only “work towards” implementing international labour rights.The pact, which still needs to be approved by the European Parliament and the governments of individual member states, also fails to mention the issue of human rights in general or the anti-democratic crackdowns in Hong Kong.Responding to China becoming the EU’s chief trading partner, the founder and chairman of Hong Kong Watch, Benedict Rogers told Breitbart London: “There remains an extraordinary naivety – or willful blindness – within the European Union about the dangers of the Chinese Communist Party regime and the risks involved in being too close or too dependent on it, even despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the Uyghur genocide and the dismantling of Hong Kong’s freedoms.“The new EU-China investment agreement is one appalling example of that, and the pursuit of further trading relations is another.“The EU should reassert its values, ensure that any trading relations include high protections for human rights – including stopping slave labour in the supply chains of global brands – and reduce its strategic dependency on China.

860,"Labour has released a new report calling on Britain to apologise for her empire, pay reparations to former colonies, and introduce a new constitution which virtually abolishes the monarchy and various other aspects of British heritage.The report, authored by the party’s External Governance Officer, Seán Patrick Griffin, does not mince words, from the title — Remaking the British State — to its declaration that the party should “seek to use the [new] constitution as a tool to achieve the social transformation which they seek.”For the avoidance of doubt, it spells out the goals of a new constitution in no uncertain terms: “Socialists should seek to reorder the British state and hardwire the constitution in favour of socialist objectives. This must be a central plank of the Labour Party’s vision to transform the UK.”The country’s existing constitution, traditions, and history are given short shrift, with the former British Empire coming in for particular criticism.“The history of the British Empire is one of subjugation of peoples, colonisation, land grabs, slavery, religious bigotry and racism,” the report proclaims — making no allowances for the good it did in defeating Nazi Germany, spearheading efforts to end the slave trade globally, and bring innovations such as the rule of law, trial by jury, and industrialisation to the wider world.“In recognition of the past wrongdoings of the British state, the new constitution should make an unreserved apology to all of the countries of the world that the Empire invaded and negatively impacted,” it proposes.“In addition, the British state should set up a reparations fund as part of the constitution, which offers financial assistance to communities across the world that can show loss and detriment as a result of the actions of the British state.”Churchill College Hosts Anti-Churchill Talk: 'Embodiment of White Supremacy', British Empire 'Far Worse' Than Nazis https://t.co/a6eTjrqL4u— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021The monarchy, too, would be virtually abolished if the report’s proposals were implemented, as although “the Monarch would remain as head of state, all of the trappings and add-ons of the monarchy should be abolished with immediate effect, including the Privy Council and the requirement to swear an oath to the Monarch to hold certain public offices.”“In addition, all royal involvement in public affairs should be subject to a constitutional prohibition, with criminal sanction if contravened,” the report adds, and the royal honours conferred by the monarchy — knighthoods, membership of the Order of the British Empire, and so on — would all be scrapped in favour of “a new Civic Award that can be conferred by the UK Parliament”.Other remnants of a traditional society would fare even worse, with the nobility abolished “in its entirety” across the country — and “a constitutional prohibition [placed] on any future creation of noble titles.”Naturally the House of Lords would be eliminated, and replaced by a so-called Senate of the Nations and Regions, as part of a wider transformation of Britain from a united kingdom into a looser federation — although England would remain without a parliament, the only home nation to do so.Parliamentary sovereignty would end in all but name, with the Blair-created Supreme Court of the United Kingdom given the power to strike down legislation incompatible with the new constitution.Farage: Sadiq Khan's Anti-British Statue Wars Will Sink the Labour Party https://t.co/AuMNeRD3qI— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, an ardent anti-Brexiteer who is nevertheless attempting to move the mood music of the party away from the overt leftism of predecessor Jeremy Corbyn — pushing for more use of the British flag and national colours in party branding, for example — has already attempted to distance himself from the report, dismissing it as a relic of the former leadership.However, its foreword it signed “Seán Patrick Griffin… Leader of the Opposition’s Office, London, February 2020” and there is no indication that its author has lost his position as Labour’s External Governance Officer.Labour’s New Leader Promotes MP Who Shared ‘Abused Girls Need to Shut Their Mouths for Good of Diversity’ Tweet https://t.co/ujMooJCmDy— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 11, 2020London / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeAnti-patriotismBritainBritish ConstitutionBritish cultureBritish EmpireBritish HistoryBritish MonarchyBritish Royal Familyfar leftKeir StarmerlabourLabour Partymonarchyreparationsroyal familySeán Patrick GriffinSJWsSlave TradeSlaverysocial justice warriorsThe queenTraditionUnited KingdomWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
861,"Southern Finland is reported showing signs of a Wuhan coronavirus “baby boom” as the number of births expected in March could be up to ten per cent higher than the previous year.Aydin Tekay, head of the division of Gynecology and Obstetrics at the Helsinki University Hospital, stated that southern Finland has already seen a slight increase in births so far this year and that pregnancy screenings suggest an even larger increase in the area in the coming months.“During February, we will see if the forecast is correct, but it will probably be quite a busy March,” Tekay told Finland’s public broadcaster YLE.Tekay said that the trend shows many people in the area were more cautious in the Spring when lockdown measures were more severe and that the increase in pregnancies likely occurred in the Summer.Turku University Hospital has also projected a slight increase in births for February and March, but maternity ward head Eeva Ekholm noted that the increase was below five per cent.Exclusive: West Must Solve ‘Demographic Crisis’ or ‘Europe Will Be Lost’ – Hungary Govt https://t.co/mKBLaG3Py2— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021In the early days of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, some predicted that the lockdown measures implemented in many countries would lead to a baby boom.

If we can’t find a long-term solution to the problem, if we don’t act immediately, Europe will be lost.”“Hungarians were more prepared to [deal with the] crisis caused by the epidemic thanks to 10 years of pro-family decision-making,” Ms Novák said.She added: “I also deeply believe that thanks to our pro-family initiatives during the crisis, we will be able to overcome the negative consequences of COVID soon.”HealthLondon / Europebaby boomChina viruscoronavirusDemographicsFinlandHelsinkiWuhan coronavirus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
862,"Academics with ties to the Chinese Communist Party’s military have reportedly secured research funding from Britain’s leading national security laboratory.The Ministry of Defence’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), one of the UK’s most secretive military research facilities, has been found to have shelled out “substantial sums” of money to Chinese-tied researchers.Projects at the University of Bristol, Imperial College London, and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have received financial support from the Ministry of Defence facility in Porton Down, The Times reported on Monday.The report claimed that three academics at Bristol University’s Composites Institute have lectured at Zhejiang University in China and even went on to open a laboratory there. The professors are said to be experts in crafting novel materials for the use in extreme conditions such as jet engines, satellites, nuclear power stations, and other “stealth structures”.The government-backed Australian defence and strategic policy think tank, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) classified Zhejiang University in 2019 as “high risk” for its “moderately high number of defence laboratories, relationship with defence industry, and links to economic and cyber espionage”.Over a dozen British universities are reportedly under investigation by security services over their relationships with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which may have violated national security and human rights laws.  https://t.co/JPASmB4Fvn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021Imperial College London and Heriot-Watt University’s links to the Chinese military were both laid out in a report this month from the think tank Civitas, entitled Arming China? The Chinese Military Complex and Its Potential Exploitation of Scientific Research at UK Universities.Imperial College London — which signed a £5 million deal with CCP-linked tech giant Huawei last year— was found to have at least “four research centres sponsored by major Chinese weapons suppliers”, including the development of China’s next-generation stealth fighters.Heriot-Watt University was also mentioned in the report for receiving money from UK defence groups to partner with the Chinese to develop radar jamming technology.The university was found to have worked on another project with one of China’s top defence research universities, Harbin Engineering University, to create a password-breaking tool, which could potentially lead to “serious leaks of sensitive information”.Imperial College claimed that the details in the Civitas report “completely mischaracterise the true nature of our sponsorship arrangements”. Heriot-Watt claimed that any research carried out by staff complies with national security and intellectual property laws.Universities in Britain have seen increased scrutiny for pairing with the Beijing dictatorship, with MI6 reportedly investigating “some of the most prestigious universities in the country” for possibly violating national security laws by working with Chinese weapons developers.Some 200 British academics are also reportedly under investigation for allegedly sharing military technology with the communist regime.The author of the Civitas report, Radomir Tylecote, said: “British taxpayers are paying for research that might unintentionally help China’s military soon attain a potentially dominant position,” adding: “This is strategically incoherent – especially when UK spending on research for its own military needs is so anaemic.”REVEALED: Cambridge University and the BBC have become the latest British establishment institutions accused of working in step with China. https://t.co/I2f8lNBwwj— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 10, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaAsiaEducationLondon / EuropeBritish universitiesChinaChinese Communist Partychinese militaryChinese military technologyImperial College Londonmilitary technologyMinistry of Defencenational securityPorton DownUK educationUnited KingdomUniversity of Bristol.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

864,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) – A shipment of COVID-19 vaccines produced in China arrived in Hungary on Tuesday, making it the first of the European Union’s 27 nations to receive a Chinese vaccine.A jet carrying 550,000 vaccine doses developed by the Chinese state-owned company Sinopharm landed at Budapest´s international airport after flying in from Beijing. The shipment is enough to treat 275,000 people with the two-dose jab, Dr. Agnes Galgoczy of the National Public Health Center told a press conference.Chief Eurocrat Admits EU Made Mistakes that Resulted in Vaccine Fiasco https://t.co/wMu4aBJQ1W— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2021“With this vaccine, five different types are now available in Hungary so that we may get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible,” Galgoczy said, adding that vaccine shots won’t begin until the shipment is evaluated by the National Public Health Center.Hungarian health authorities were the first in the EU to approve the Sinopharm jab for emergency use on Jan. 29. That came after a government decree streamlined Hungary´s vaccine approval process by allowing any vaccine administered to at least 1 million people worldwide to be used without undergoing review by the country´s medicines regulator.The country expects to receive 5 million total doses of the Sinopharm vaccine over the next four months, enough to treat 2.5 million people in the country of nearly 10 million.Hungarian officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban, have been critical of the EU’s common vaccine procurement program, claiming the bloc’s slow rollout of shots is costing lives.German Vice-Chancellor Reportedly Slams 'Really S***' EU Vaccine Programme https://t.co/GVv3CedxOR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021“If vaccines aren´t coming from Brussels, we must obtain them from elsewhere … One cannot allow Hungarians to die simply because Brussels is too slow in procuring vaccines,” Orban said last month.Hungary has also agreed to purchase 2 million doses of Russia´s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, which hospitals began administering in Budapest last week.On Friday, Orban claimed these additional vaccines from Russia and China will enable Hungary to vaccinate millions more people by the end of May than other European countries with similar populations.“As things stand now, (we can vaccinate) 6.8 million people by the end of May or beginning of June,” Orban said in a radio interview. “I think this is huge.”EU’s Top Diplomat in Moscow: Hopes Russia’s Sputnik Vaccine Will Be Approved by Bloc https://t.co/1AVFXZ7QbL— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 5, 2021Orban earlier said he would personally choose to be inoculated with the Sinopharm vaccine since he trusts it the most.“I think the Chinese have known this virus for the longest and they probably know it the best,” he said last month.The Sinopharm vaccine, which the developer says is nearly 80% effective, is already in use in Hungary´s non-EU neighbor Serbia, where around half a million people, including ethnic Hungarians, have already received the jab. The company has not yet released data on the results of the vaccine’s Stage 3 trials.The new vaccines shipment represents around 40% of all COVID-19 vaccine doses that Hungary has received so far, and makes Sinopharm nearly equally prevalent in Hungary as the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine.But recent polling shows that some Hungarians are reluctant to receive the Sinopharm jab.

865,"A public prosecutor has turned over an investigation into an anti-mass migration protest in the French Pyrenees to the office tasked with fighting genocide and war crimes.The prosecutor’s office in Saint-Gaudens handed over an investigation into a January 9th protest along the Franco-Spanish border by the activist youth group Generation Identitaire to the Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity, Genocide, and War Crimes (OCLCH).Local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy stated that he had referred the matter to that hate crime division of the OCLCH which would be working alongside local gendarmerie investigators, La Depeche reports.France to Increase Border Security After Identitarians Use Helicopters, Trucks in Alps ‘Defend Europe’ Action  https://t.co/M4FlqfjJNh— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 24, 2018According to the newspaper, Generation Identitaire members had gone hiking along the border with Spain at Col du Portillon and deployed drones to monitor the crossing for any illegal migrants attempting to cross into French territory, citing terrorism risks as part of their “Defend Europe” mission.The prosecutor said the activists “can make statements that are not factual; that is freedom of expression. But there is what we can say and what we cannot say — what is freedom of expression, and what is criminal.”“I’m not saying I’ll necessarily have a prosecution at the end. I’m saying I’m investigating and at the end of this investigation I’ll establish whether or not there was a criminal offence,” Mr Amunzateguy added.The potential prosecution comes just months after a court of appeal in Grenoble acquitted several members of the activist group after they had been found guilty of offences linked to a similar 2018 protest in the French Alps.Austrian Identitarians Fully Acquitted Of ‘Mafia’ and Hate Crime Charges  https://t.co/dLOtm9s3ff— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 27, 2018Despite the recent acquittals — along with other failed prosecutions against the group, including an attempt to label the activists part of a mafia organisation in Austria in  2018 — the French government wants to dissolve Generation Identitaire.Interior Minister Gérald Darmamin said on Saturday that he believed the activists could be in violation of the law by “provoking discrimination, hatred, or violence against a person or group of persons on the basis of their origin”.Marine Le Pen’s National Rally said of the French government’s proposal: “Such a dissolution would also be contrary to the constant jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that ‘freedom of expression is one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and even applies to ideas that offend, shock, or worry’.”ImmigrationLaw and OrderLondon / EuropeEmmanuel MacronFranceGénération IdentitaireGeneration IdentityGérald Darmaninhuman rightsMass MigrationprotestPyrenees.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

We have been taking a knee before games since June but, like many of our fellow players at other clubs, no longer believe that this is having an impact,” the statement explained, somewhat equivocally.“As a group we are fully behind and proud of Brentford’s desire to become the most inclusive club in the country and the drive towards equality under the #BeeTogether banner,” they added.The ‘no kneeling’ policy first went into effect in a game against Barnsley FC at the weekend.

867,"British police have begun employing drones to monitor political protests throughout the country, as campaigners warn that the increasingly heavy-handed tactics employed by the police may be used to “silence dissent”.A freedom of information request from the UK Drone Watch campaign group found that police across the country have begun using drones to surveil protests.Police forces in Surrey, Cleveland, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire and West Midlands, as well as the Devon and Cornwall and Avon and Somerset forces, were all found to have used drones during protests, The Guardian reported.Protesters monitored by the police with drones included anti-lockdown, Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion activists as well as one so-called ‘extreme-right protest’.Chris Cole of UK Drone Watch said: “Police are adopting this new surveillance technology with little oversight or consent from the public.”“There seems to be little control over how the data is being gathered or stored with alarmingly worrying replies from the police indicating they do not understand what rights the public have in regard to accessing data,” he explained.The campaign manager for the human rights organisation Liberty, Rosalind Comyn, claimed that the deployment of drones will be used to limit the right to protest, saying: “Protest is a key way we can all fight for a better society and stand up for what we believe in.“Recent years have seen a concerted attack on the right to protest from police and government, which particularly threatens people who are already marginalised and cut off from having their voices heard.“Increased mass surveillance, whether through drones or other developing tools like facial recognition, is designed to intimidate and control, and ultimately silence dissent.”The National Police Chiefs’ Council denied the accusations, with the councils lead for the police use of drones, assistant chief constable Steve Barry, saying: “Police use drones at protests to help inform policing tactics to keep everyone safe. Their use is well regulated and governed by the surveillance commissioner and information commissioner guidelines.”Exclusive Video: Watch Cops Storm, Forcibly Shut Down Peaceful Anti-Lockdown Protest in London https://t.co/KHEbyz6vvB— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 27, 2020Police officers in London are also often seen carrying video cameras to document protests and have in recent months employed tactics such as kettling to break up anti-lockdown demonstrations under the guise of enforcing coronavirus restrictions.Since December, protests have all but ceased in the nation’s capital, with police threatening to issue attendees £10,000 fixed penalty notices for breaching the national lockdown.In a major example of the effectiveness of the London Police’s anti-protest capabilities, 190 anti-lockdown protesters were arrested in one evening, ironically on November 5th, the anniversary of the failed Gunpowder Plot to blow up Parliament in 1605, known as Guy Fawkes Night in Britain.The police have also been accused of having a political agenda in how they deal with different protests, with London mayoral candidate David Kurten telling Breitbart London during a December anti-lockdown rally that there is a “clear bias” in how Black Lives Matter ralliers were policed compared to anti-lockdown demos.“You have Black Lives Matter protests with way more than six people that are allowed to go-ahead… but they come in and specifically target people who are just talking because they think we are against the lockdown and we might have opinions that may be unacceptable to those in Westminster,” Kurten said.The disparity in policing has been apparent in London over the past year and was even admitted to by Met Commissioner Cressida Dick, who said in July that police took a hands-off approach to BLM demonstrations for fear of sparking “serious disorder”.‘You Don’t Need to Obey an Illegal Order!’: Tory MP Stands up to Cops Arresting Elderly Lockdown Protester https://t.co/43CoUI60HV— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 25, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaCrimeLaw and OrderLondon / Europeblack lives matter protestBlack Lives Matter UKBritish policedomestic surveillanceDronesExtinction Rebellionfree speechGovernment SurveillanceLockdown ProtestsOrwellianProtestersprotestssurveillancesurveillance stateUK policeUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

President Emmanuel Macron says the efforts are also needed to protect French values like gender equality and secularism from encroaching fundamentalism in some communities.But many French Muslims say the draft law limits religious freedom and unfairly targets them, and say France already has enough laws to fight terrorist violence.

870,"At least ten former staff members are ready to come forward as claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex bullied and “humiliated” aides are probed.Allegations that Meghan, the former Suits starlet and wife of Prince Harry, inflicted “emotional cruelty and manipulation” on staff are being investigated by Buckingham Palace, after a former aide revealed she had been the subject of a bullying complaint and accused her of driving a number of people out of their jobs.“A group of people are queuing up to be involved. They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face. Our eyes met and she lowered hers, humiliation etched on her features.”Prince William Angered by Meghan and Harry's 'Insulting, Disrespectful, and Petulant' Attitude to Queen https://t.co/kvuRJbdJA9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021Before Meghan and Harry abandoned their duties as working royals — but not their titles — to pursue money-making ventures and activism in the United States, their communications secretary wrote to Prince William’s private secretary said he was “very concerned that the Duchess [of Sussex, Meghan] was able to bully two PAs out of the household in the past year. The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

But in March 2020, the RSPCA confirmed that the lawyer would not be facing legal action.The animal charity had stated that while it was not illegal to kill a fox, there may be a criminal offence if in doing so the animal faced undue suffering.

872,"British foreign secretary Dominic Raab predicted on Sunday that businesses in the United Kingdom will begin requiring a form of vaccine passport for their customers.In the latest example of the mixed messages coming from Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government on the issue of vaccine passports, Mr Raab said that the government is considering the implementation of such a scheme on the “domestic or local level”.While the government previously came out against the use of vaccine passports, the foreign secretary told LBC Radio that in places such as supermarkets the idea: “hasn’t been ruled out and it’s under consideration, but of course you’ve got to make it workable.”“Whether it’s at an international, domestic or local level, you’ve got to know that the document being presented is something that you can rely on and that it’s an accurate reflection of the status of the individual,” he said.“I’m not sure there’s a foolproof answer in the way that it’s sometimes presented but of course we’ll look at all the options,” Raab added.However, a government spokesman later told the radio station: “There are no plans to introduce immunity passports for use domestically.”The director of the civil liberties watchdog, Big Brother Watch, Silkie Carlo criticised the idea in an interview with BBC Radio 4, saying: “We have to ask ourselves, what really is the purpose of a vaccine passport? Well, the core purpose is to afford more rights to vaccinated people than to everyone else.”She claimed that the introduction of vaccine passports will create a “health apartheid” state in the UK, which Carlo said is “completely wrong for a country where rights and equality matter”.Q: Will you need “a domestic vaccine passport to go into a supermarket”?A: “It’s something that hasn’t been ruled out, it’s under consideration” – @DominicRaab A dangerously irrational and draconian response from one of the highest offices of state. pic.twitter.com/iOsX3hzyeT— Big Brother Watch (@BigBrotherWatch) February 14, 2021Britain’s vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi previously predicted that businesses in the UK would require immunity passports for their customers, however, this month the Conservative MP ruled out the use of the health passes, describing the system as “discriminatory.”Yet, the British government has reportedly been funding projects that would create QR code smartphone applications that could serve as a basis for such a scheme.Several countries within the European Union have already announced their intentions to roll out health passes, with the government of Denmark planning to become the first country to introduce a passport this month.Last week, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis — one of the leading champions of the idea in the EU — announced that his government would be partnering with Israel to introduce a “trial run” vaccine passport system between the two countries.On Sunday, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair — the most outspoken proponent of vaccine passports in the UK — said that they will become inevitable and that Britain should lead the way in adopting the programme.“This is not about discrimination, or hostility towards those not vaccinated or tested. It is a completely understandable desire to know whether those we mix with might be carrying the disease,” Blair wrote in the Daily Mail.Mr Blair said that his think tank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, is currently involved in helping craft health passport models, including the CommonPass initiative being pushed by the architects of the so-called ‘Great Reset‘, the World Economic Forum.“We have the technology which allows us to do this securely and effectively. The need is obvious. The world is moving in this direction,” the former Labour leader said, adding: “We should plan for an agreed ‘passport’ now.

873,"Welsh police have been accused of subverting the democratic process after they were caught on video “harassing” a Member of the Welsh Parliament for distributing political leaflets for the upcoming election.Neil McEvoy MS, who is challenging the left-wing Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford for his seat in Cardiff West, accused the police of political intimidation after they showed up on his doorstep to warn him to refrain from campaigning.In the video, Mr McEvoy criticised the police for an apparent double standard, as the South Wales Police have been distributing “crime prevention” leaflets. He went on to say that his political party, Propel, will seek to remove the Chief Constable if the “abuse of the democratic process” continues.In comments made to Breitbart London, McEvoy said: “This is nothing less than the Labour Welsh Government abusing the powers it has to target other parties with less money.“Labour has simply come up with this ‘guidance’, which was not voted on, is not actual law and has no scientific basis, specifically to target volunteers delivering election leaflets.”McEvoy, whose Propel Wales party argues in favour of Welsh independence, and against lockdown from a broadly free market-centrist position, said there was a double standard at work where established forces like the police and Welsh Labour party were at liberty to get their messages out but new political parties were effectively blocked. He continued in his remarks: “people receive all manner of other leaflets through the door every day, including from the police. I think it’s a breach of the Human Rights Act, as it’s put in place a policy that puts certain parties and candidates at a disadvantage.“When the police are banging on politicians’ doors late in the evening to “caution” them against delivering election leaflets you know things have gone too far. I didn’t think this kind of thing could happen in Wales but I’m really concerned that our democracy is under threat,” McEvoy concluded.I used to look with concern at police harassment of politicians in other countries. Never thought it could happen here. Now it's taking place on my own doorstep.Full video, including the ""caution"" here: https://t.co/FNzkqg6F0d#COVID #lockdown pic.twitter.com/4g7GlNlWAz— Neil McEvoy MS (@neiljmcevoy) February 15, 2021The Welsh Government has argued that passing out campaign leaflets for the May 6th election is “not a reasonable excuse to leave home”.First Minister Drakeford has also said that volunteers should not be used to distribute leaflets but suggested that paid delivery mail services and social media advertisements could be employed to get out a candidate’s message.In January, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds accused Drakeford of trying to limit the teacher of smaller political parties and non-wealthy candidates.“Mark Drakeford should be following the science and not party politics. If it is safe for individuals to be paid to deliver leaflets, then it’s safe for volunteers to do the same. Stopping volunteer delivery means that only large parties and rich candidates will be able to campaign on any great scale.“I honestly thought Labour were better than this,” she added.Liberal Democrat candidate Cadan ap Tomos said: “This is a blatant attempt to shut out smaller parties and many well-meaning independent candidates out of the democratic process.”In January, London mayoral candidate Brian Rose was fined by police for campaigning on what he described as his “COVID safe” bus.“With an unelected mayor currently heading up our city for the past year, including its police force, it is incredibly worrying that democracy is being eroded in this way, while the mayor’s own team continue to campaign,” Mr Rose said.Khan’s term as mayor expired last year but the election was postponed because of coronavirus.Britain Is Turning Into a Totalitarian Police State, Warns Top Lawyer Lord Sumption https://t.co/pLAKQoAYaT— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 30, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropePolitics#CovidNazisBritish policecampaignscoronavirusCoronavirus measuresdemocracyElectionsMark DrakefordSouth Wales PoliceUnited KingdomWalesWelsh government.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
874,"Vaccine passports for the Chinese coronavirus will “inevitably” be implemented for international travel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted in a press conference on Monday.The British government has been wavering on the issue of vaccine passports for the past few months. However, Mr Johnson gave the clearest indication yet that such a scheme will be imposed on Britons.“I think inevitably there will be great interest in ideas like can you show that you had a vaccination against COVID in the way that you sometimes have to show you have had a vaccination against yellow fever or other diseases in order to travel somewhere,” Johnson said at a Downing Street press briefing.“I think that is going to be very much in the mix down the road, I think that is going to happen,” the British leader added.The language from Mr Johnson mirrors that of former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has reportedly been advising the government on the Chinese coronavirus. Blair has also said that vaccine passports will become “inevitable”, and therefore called on Johnson’s government to become one of the first adopters of the scheme.Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed on Monday that the British government is currently in negotiations with other countries to develop a digital form of a vaccine passport.“There are some countries around the world that are considering bringing in rules saying you can only travel if you have been vaccinated – these aren’t in place yet, but there are countries who are actively floating this idea and proposing it,” he told Sky News.Hancock argued that due to the current restrictive state of international travel, it would be important for people in the UK to be able to show their vaccination status to go abroad.“So we are working with countries around the world on the basis for this and how that vaccine certification can happen in a way that can be assured,” he said.“We can avoid this and the complications of multiple passes and varying travel requirements if the UK takes the lead on developing a single, global COVID pass.” https://t.co/AgDRBOMz26— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 28, 2021At his press conference, Prime Minister Johnson went on to say that he does not believe that health passes will be required for people to enter establishments such as pubs. However, he did suggest that larger venues like nightclubs, cinemas, or theatres may require patrons to present a negative coronavirus test.“I think that will be the route that we go down and that businesses will go down,” Mr Johnson said, adding: “You are already seeing lots of business using the potential of rapid, on-the-day testing as well. I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward.”Johnson did caution that it is “still early days” and that “there are lots of discussions still to be had”.Cinemas and theatres have already begun partnering with firms working on vaccine passports to facilitate their reopening.David Chadwick of Verifiable Credentials — a company currently funded by the government to develop a digital vaccine certificate — told The Telegraph that he has already come to agreements with a theatre and a cinema complex to run trials of the technology.The plan would create electronic vaccination certificates tied with data from the National Health Service (NHS) which would be paired with tickets bought online to create a smartphone QR code to be used upon entry.Despite denials from Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi and Cabinet Minister Michael Gove that the government would implement vaccine passports, the British government has reportedly been funding eight separate projects to develop the health passes.The idea of vaccine passports has been picking up steam across Europe, with several EU member states announcing their intentions to adopt the measure. Both Denmark and Greece have said that they will launch vaccine passports for international travel this month.Following Mr Johnson’s press briefing on Monday, the civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch warned that vaccine passports would create a “health apartheid” state, saying: “We cannot banish people from public life for having the wrong vaccine ID.

875,"European Union parliamentarian Guy Verhofstadt has admitted that the bloc’s vaccine rollout has been “a fiasco”, and that Ursula von der Leyen’s leadership has potentially “ruined” relations with the United Kingdom.In a video entitled: “the inconvenient truth behind the vaccination fiasco of the EU”, Verhofstadt took aim at European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for potentially ruining diplomatic ties with the UK. “The use of the Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol has been a diplomatic disaster that destroyed in a few seconds the seriousness of the negotiations with the UK conducted by Michel Barnier for more than three years,” he said.Verhofstadt went on to malign von der Leyen’s obfuscation of blame in the failed vaccine rollout, saying that the EU was “ill-conceived” in its negotiations with pharmaceutical companies.“I think the measures taken by the Commission are hugely symbolic, insufficient and counterproductive,” he added.The Eurocrat went on to say that Europe has fallen “short of its potential… a fiasco I call it, and a fiasco it is”, blaming the leadership of the European Commission for the “dramatically” low number of vaccines given throughout the bloc.“If you believe in Europe, if you love Europe, it’s your duty to be the most vocal critic especially when Europe falls short of its potential and our expectations. That’s exactly what’s happening now with the vaccinations,” the MEP said.“Europe is no more, no less than the world leader in vaccine production today. More than 75 per cent of vaccines worldwide are produced in Europe. Nevertheless, there is a crucial lack of supply,” he Verhofstadt noted but admitted that Brexit Britain, the United States, Canada, and Israel are not facing similar shortages.Last week, Breitbart London reported that the United Kingdom — which was branded as “stupid” for leaving the EU and its attendant ‘benefits’ like membership of the European Medicines Agency by Mr Verhofstadt — has vaccinated more people than the entire European Union in absolute terms, despite having less than one-sixth of the population to vaccinate.Pro-Europeans should be the first to be critical when things go wrong. On vaccines, they certainly have… My take on @vonderleyen’s #vaccine fiasco and how to move forward and fix it 👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/NiP0TQ3Xxl— Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) February 13, 2021The typically globalist-minded politician was seemingly annoyed that vaccines produced in Europe would be shipped to other countries, calling upon the EU to “radically” change its strategy and re-negotiate contracts with the pharmaceutical firms to be more similar to those negotiated by the newly independent Britain.Mr Verhofstadt then called for the EU to reduce its onerous regulatory requirements in order to fast track the approval of future vaccines.The Belgian MEP did, however, return to a more classically Eurocrat position, in calling for the establishment of a new ‘Health Union’ bureaucracy, which he said would be necessary to “match the United States” in the development of new medicines and treatments.He concluded by pronouncing that the European Union was not the problem, but rather “the basis for the solution.”While Mr Verhofstadt touted the possibilities for the future of the EU, Brexit leader Nigel Farage has warned that the vaccine fiasco will mark the end of the European Union.Farage noted that the unelected politicians in the European Commission, such as von der Leyen, are often people who have “failed” in domestic politics.“They’re the people who make the big decisions that affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people. You can’t vote for them, and you can’t sack them. You can’t change the decisions that they make,” Farage said.“I genuinely think that on something as important as this [the pandemic], the magnitude of this, I really believe this is the beginning of the end of the European Union as we know it,” Mr Farage predicted.The European Union appears to be haemorrhaging goodwill over its botched handling of coronavirus vaccine procurement, as reliably pro-Brussels outlets line up to criticise the leadership of the bloc in the strongest terms. https://t.co/ywGlZP8Jty— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 3, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitcoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineEUEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionGuy VerhofstadtUnited KingdomUrsula von der LeyenVaccine.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

877,"London Mayor Sadiq Khan has been revealed to have given nearly £100,000 in taxpayer money to a Black Lives Matter-style leftist activist group over the course of two years.A Freedom of Information (FoI) request has revealed that Sadiq Khan’s “Violence Reduction Unit Community Seed Fund” has funded the 4Front Project, a youth organisation established in 2012 to ostensibly take on youth violence, which they claim is driven by “racial inequality” and the criminal justice system itself.The Westminster political blog Guido Fawkes reported that the London Mayor’s office gave the group £50,000 in 2019/20, and £46,042 in 2018/19 to help the “youth-led intervention project for 100 young people involved in and affected by serious youth violence”.During the height of the unrest in the UK following the death of American George Floyd, the BLM-style group staged a ‘blockade’ of a London police station after a teenager was arrested on suspicion of possession of marijuana in August. Approximately forty members of the group squared off with police officers, some of whom sustained minor injuries, outside the Colindale police station.The leader of 4 Front, Temi Mwale, told The Guardian at the time: “We tried to de-escalate the situation, I actually think it was going well. But at some point, someone … decided it would be appropriate to send four, five huge vans full of hundreds of you, to start dragging community workers across the floor.”Mwale, who is set to be featured by TedxLondon’s women series, has previously said: “The racism in this country is brutal, it is overt, it’s very plain to see, and if people cannot see it and they’ve simply buried their head in the sand.”She also called to “defund the police” as well as the establishment of a “Truth and Reconciliation process” to confront the “colonial and racist legacy” of the United Kingdom.Watch: BLM Protesters Chant ‘F*ck The Police’, Call for Commissioner to Resign:
Kurt ZindulkaMembers of the partly city-funded 4 Front Project were filmed by Breitbart London staging a protest outside New Scotland Yard in September, calling for the resignation of Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick for supposed racial bias in police profiling.In the video, one of the activists is seen leading a chant of “f*ck the police”, going on to say: “We scream ‘f*ck the police’ because they don’t serve and protect us. We scream ‘f*ck the police’ because they kill us, stop and search us, brutalise us, assault us like it’s ok.”“I’m done seeing the videos. I’m done seeing everything. All I want is change, and I just want to change the systematic, institutionally racist bullshit,” the activist added.The revelation that Sadiq Khan has funded the 4 Front Project comes after the leftist London Mayor unveiled his Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm, a publicly funded group of left-wing activists and celebrities who are set to target statues and historical monuments.The Red Guard-style commission includes Star Wars actor Riz Ahmed as well as social rights activist Toyin Agbetu, who was previously filmed heckling the Queen during the celebration of Britain’s abolition of slavery, the first country to do so. Agbetu shouted at the Queen: “You should be ashamed!” and “This is an insult to us!”Brexit leader Nigel Farage has warned that if the Labour Party fails to limit the radicalism of Sadiq Khan it will face electoral ruin, saying that if Sir Keir Starmer “cannot rein in Khan, his identity politics, and his willful adoption of cancel culture, then the Labour Party will lose by even more votes at the next election than Jeremy Corbyn did at the last.”Exclusive Footage: ‘Are You Loyal to Britain?

878,"Britain’s Electoral Commission has rejected efforts to register Black Lives Matter as a political party on grounds that it would be “likely to mislead voters”.“The application to register Black Lives Matter as a political party was refused by the Commission on the basis that the proposed name is likely to mislead a voter as to the effect of their vote,” said a spokesman for the controversial regulator in comments reported by MailOnline.“As part of our considerations we examined the existing groups by the same or similar names in the UK. Having contacted a number of groups, they confirmed that the party was not associated with them,” the spokesman explained.“Our assessment concluded that, whilst the BLM movement is a grassroots movement, it was still likely that the proposed name would mislead a voter as to the effect of their vote. This was on the basis that a reasonable voter could assume that the party represents, or is in some way associated with, these groups when that is not the case.“If a name cannot be accepted, the associated application must be rejected. In addition, other elements of the application were rejected, including the constitution and financial scheme.”The problems with the constitution were not enumerated, however.Watch: BLM Radical Sasha Johnson Announces Creation of the ‘First Black-Led Political Party in the UK’ https://t.co/CjnlhA60Gf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 1, 2020The Black Lives Matter UK organisation confirmed that is was not behind the efforts to register a BLM political party to contest elections, telling the MailOnline that it had “absolutely no connection, affiliations or other and no individual or group has informed or made us aware of their intentions of forming a political party under the name of Black Lives Matter. It is not us.”BLM UK added: “Those of all ethnicities and from all nations who believe in racial equality are anti-racists, we stand together… Some content published on [our] website may have political elements by the nature of a society and state governed under a system of democracy; however we operate in a humanitarian capacity and concern before all else.”BLM UK is not without its own controversies, however, having been accused of antisemitism after attacking the “settler colonial pursuits” of Israeli Jews and declaring that “we loudly and clearly stand beside our Palestinian comrades” in 2020.Brexit champion and Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage has also condemned Black Lives Matter as “a dangerous, Marxist organisation, hell-bent on anarchy” which wants to defund the police and has backing from the likes of George Soros.The people who are behind the failed effort to register a BLM party is undisclosed, according to the MailOnline, but Sasha Johnson, a prominent BLM activist and self-styled Black Panther, has already launched her own Taking the Initiative Party, which among other things wants the state to create a Race Offenders Register in which people who express views they consider problematic would be officially listed, like sex offenders.“A lot of racism happens at work and places of education in a micro-aggressive way. If you exhibit an element of bias at work, you should probably receive a warning first [before later being added to the register] so people know in future that you hold these views,” said Johnson, who also believe the police are “no different from the KKK“ and wants black people to receive Holocaust-style reparations. People gather in Westbourne Park to take part in the inaugural Million People March march from Notting Hill to Hyde Park in London on August 30, 2020, to put pressure on the UK Government into changing the “UK’s institutional and systemic racism”. – The march is organised by The Million People Movement, and takes place on the bank holiday weekend usually associated with the Notting Hill Carnival, this year cancelled due to the coronavirus covid-19 pandemic.

879,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that he wants “this lockdown to be the last”, but would not rule out a fourth.The prime minister said that he would present a “roadmap” out of lockdown next week, which should outline “the route to normality” — “even though some things are very uncertain”.“We want this lockdown to be the last. And we want progress to be cautious but also irreversible,” Mr Johnson told a Downing Street press conference on Monday evening, according to the i newspaper.However, the prime minister refused to give a “cast-iron guarantee” that this lockdown, England’s third, which was put in place on January 4th, would be the last.Prime Minister Johnson said: “No, I can’t give that guarantee, of course not, because we’re battling with nature, with a disease that is capable of mutating and changing.“I’m increasingly optimistic about the sheer extent of the possibilities that are opening up with vaccinations. I’ll be setting out as much of a timetable as we can give on the 22nd.“And I’m very hopeful that we’ll be able to go ahead and open things up.”“But I don’t want people to think I’m not optimistic. I think there’s been a big change and the big change is that science is now unquestioningly in the ascendancy over the disease,” he, however, added.Vaccine Passports Could be Used in Supermarkets Suggests UK Foreign Secretary https://t.co/I6BWrbvLZd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 16, 2021This week, Professor Stephen Reicher of the government advisory body the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) advised the Johnson administration against giving the public dates of when they can begin to have their freedoms back because when the government fails to deliver by those deadlines, it leaves people feeling “hopeless and helpless”.So far, some 90 per cent of over-70s have been offered the first shot of a coronavirus vaccine, with the UK having two varieties available: the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca.The UK has been far advanced in its vaccination programme, generally, when compared to the European Union. At one point last week, the UK had given the first dose to more people than the whole EU-27 combined.However, scientists are pressuring Johnson into a “cautious” release of lockdown measures.Imperial College’s Professor Azra Ghani has claimed that her modelling predicts a wave of deaths in Summer 2021 if lockdown is relaxed in July, and that measures should remain in place until at least September when most adults will have been vaccinated.“My advice would be to be cautious… to open up slowly, because in the long term this will be the better way out of the pandemic,” Professor Ghani told ITV News.The epidemiologist continued: “The problem is that it is highly transmissible. We now have these new variants in place that we know are even more transmissible than previously, and not everybody will be vaccinated for various reasons.“Some people can’t take the vaccine. Others will choose not to. So that can lead to subsequent epidemics if we just relaxed everything straight away.”Pro-Freedom Plan Rejected: Senior Minister Rejects ‘Arbitrary’ End of Lockdown in April https://t.co/9o7T6ZDNVF— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 15, 2021This week, the 63-strong group of lockdown sceptic Conservative MPs the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) called on the government to begin outlining an exit strategy that would lead to all restrictions being lifted by the end of April, when the most vulnerable groups will have been vaccinated and protected.Senior minister Dominic Raab rejected what he termed the “arbitrary” date, resulting in CRG Chairman Mark Harper responding: “They’re not random, arbitrary timetables.”“It’s linked very much to the rollout of the vaccine. Once you have vaccinated the top nine groups who represent 99 per cent of the people who have sadly died from Covid and about 80 per cent of those who are seriously ill, I don’t think there is a justification for these draconian restrictions,” Mr Harper added.Coronavirus Patients with Learning Disabilities Given 'Do Not Resuscitate Orders' in Britain https://t.co/QamgJ0OOEU— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021London / EuropePoliticsScienceBoris JohnsoncoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownsocial distancingUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
880,"Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has criticised pro-migrant activist lawyers for filing last-minute ‘human rights’ based appeals to delay deportations for criminal migrants.The Lord Chancellor, who heads the ministry of justice, said that he and Home Secretary Priti Patel were working on ways to “streamline” the immigration system including restricting the use of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which enables criminal migrants to claim they are at risk of “torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment” in order to avoid deportation.Condemning the manner in which activist lawyers acting on behalf of criminal non-citizens were making a mockery of British justice and of Britons, Mr Buckland told the Daily Mail that the removals process had become “very, very lengthy and, frankly, sometimes deliberately elongated in order to buy people more time in the country”.“What I don’t think people like is being taken for a ride by people who keep on inventing new grounds of appeal,” he added.Mr Buckland was alluding to the “activist lawyers” that Ms Patel’s Home Office had outright condemned for blocking the deportation of illegal aliens who crossed the English Channel from France — often travelling through several safe countries beforehand before landing in Britain — claiming to need asylum in the UK.In August 2020, Whitehall sources told media that in one planned deportation of migrants who had entered the UK illegally via channel dinghies, the department was set upon by caseworkers from three separate law firms who set to work to delay returning migrants to Spain, a safe country they had passed through on their way to the UK, with the returns being agreed with the Spanish government.A high profile tussle between activist lawyers and the government included last year’s efforts to deport 23 criminal migrants back to Jamaica. Celebrities and Labour MPs who condemned deporting the foreign criminals attempted to compare the removals to the Windrush Scandal, despite the flight including rapists, sex offenders, and murderers.Initially, all 23 had been removed from one flight on varying grounds of appeal, including Jermaine Stewart who was jailed in 2014 for six years for raping a woman who fell asleep on his couch at his home in Liverpool.Some were removed on the allegations that they had, in fact, been victims of human slavery.Judge Blocks Deportation of Migrant Double Rapist Because of Poor Healthcare in Somalia  https://t.co/F5TzJY7l09— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021Buckland specifically raised this abuse of laws meant to protect genuine victims of human trafficking and slavery, telling the Mail: “The modern slavery laws are such an important, ground-breaking piece of legislation. It breaks my heart to think it might be potentially open to abuse by people just because they want to launch another argument to buy them more time.”Thirteen of the 23 were eventually deported in early December including three drug dealers, a man who illegally possessed a firearm, two convicted for sexual activity with a girl under 16, one man convicted of manslaughter, and three murderers.It is not just activist lawyers who are thwarting British justice in the name of compassion.On Sunday, Breitbart London reported on how a judge had blocked the removal of a double rapist, who posed a “high risk of serious harm” to the public, on grounds he would not be able to access adequate mental health care in his native Somalia.The immigration tribunal judge, Judge Judith Gleeson, expressed concern that the 49-year-old sexual predator would face stigmatisation for his mental health issues because of the cultural attitudes in his home country, and be in danger of being considered “‘possessed’”, subjected to “inhuman and degrading treatment”, and risking “stoning and chaining”.‘Activist Lawyers’ Block Deportation of 23 Illegal Migrants With Last Minute Legal Challenges  https://t.co/mPHrQ6T1GX— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 10, 2020The Sun reported on Sunday that a convicted Islamist terrorist is on the verge of winning his refugee claim in the UK after a 27-year-long battle, because he faces the death penalty for part in a plot to assassinate the Egyptian prime minister.Yasser Al-Sirri was also charged in the U.S. in connection to the World Trade Center bombing, claimed that Osama Bin Laden died an “honourable death”, and defended Taliban propaganda videos which showed American military vehicles being bombed.The 58-year-old member of Egypt’s Islamic Jihad first claimed asylum in the UK in 1994 after being found guilty by an Egyptian court in absentia for the failed assassination plot. A car bomb had detonated outside of a girls’ school, and while failing in its primary goal to kill the prime minister, resulted in the death of a 12-year-old girl.His eight attempts to appeal his asylum rejections have cost an estimated £2 million in British taxpayers’ money.Last week, the Appeal Court ruled in Al-Sirri’s favour, with the Home Office now said to be considering its next steps in removing the foreign terrorist.Just One in 40 Illegal Channel Migrants Returned to EU: Report https://t.co/fR1uTu23rc— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 8, 2020CrimeImmigrationLondon / Europeactivistsdeportationsforeign criminalshome officeLawyersRobert BucklandUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

882,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate.

884,"The number of children aged nine to 12 self-harming in the UK has doubled in just six years, with indications that mental health problems are increasing amongst the very young.According to BBC Radio 4’s File on 4 programme, the number of pre-teens attending hospital after intentionally injuring themselves rose from 221 in 2013-14 to 508 in 2019-20. With population growth factored in, it results in a rate of self-harm for this age-range having doubled.Professor Keith Hawton, a specialist in suicide and self-harm at the University of Oxford’s School of Psychiatry, observed that it appeared “as though the problem is spreading down the age range somewhat”.“I do think it’s important that it’s recognised that self-harm can occur in relatively young children, which many people are surprised by. I think it indicates that mental health issues are perhaps increasing in this very young age range,” Professor Hawton said, according to The Guardian which previewed the episode “Surviving Self Harm”, due to be aired on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday night.Unclear of why precisely there had been this rise, Professor Hawton observed that there had been an increase in mental health problems in children, “and there’s been a particular increase in anxiety disorders, particularly in females, and also eating disorders, which are quite closely associated with self-harm, including self-injury”.Lord Sumption Brands Lockdown ‘Thoroughly Inhumane’ https://t.co/OwoC14VOnZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 10, 2021Self-harm — defined as including cutting and poisoning, such as overdosing — was found by the BBC to be twice as prevalent amongst girls as boys in the age group. Around ten pre-teens are presenting at hospital every week with signs of self-harm.The broadcaster also revealed a doubling in admissions for the higher age group, 13 to 17, in seven years.Last week, a London psychiatrist said he was in no doubt that lockdown was to blame for the surge in mental health referrals in children, pinpointing the closure of schools and the banning of socialisation and team sports.“One can only say the major factor across it all is pandemic — the lack of activities, the lack of schooling, the lack of opportunities for these young people and probably a deterioration of wellbeing of their parents not being able to cope,” Dr Omer Moghraby had said.Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary wrote earlier this month that the frequency of children presenting at Accident and Emergency experiencing a mental health issue had gone from once to twice a week before the lockdowns to once to twice a day. He added that self-harm was observed more and more frequently in pre-teens.Child behaviour expert Elizabeth O’Shea predicted in January a “mental health ticking time bomb” amongst the young because of lockdowns, including a rise in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), depression, and anxiety.An October investigation by The Guardian found that since the beginning of the pandemic there had been a 30 per cent increase in children being prescribed medication for sleep disorders, compared to two years ago. Charities and other organisations had told the newspaper they had seen rises in eating disorders and self-harm amongst children.Amid Rise in Child Self-Harm, Suicidality, Alcohol Deaths Boris Appoints ‘Mental Health Ambassador’ https://t.co/YKKQzx86sf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 4, 2021EducationHealthLondon / EuropeChildrenmental healthself harmUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
885,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Net Zero policies are driving up energy bills by £10 billion a year and hitting the poor hardest, according to the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF).💵 Climate policy costs are adding £10bn a year to energy bills, paid disproportionately by poorer people Electricity prices 40% higher than in the absence of government policies😱People who have electric heating are paying up to £500 a year extra— GWPF (@thegwpfcom) February 15, 2021The government is clearly not unaware of the problem because Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng recently published a policy document — Sustainable Warmth: Protecting Vulnerable Households in England — offering a range of subsidies including a ‘£140 warm home discount’ for those living in ‘vulnerable fuel poor homes.’But as the GWPF’s energy editor Dr John Constable points out, this is just tinkering at the margins. The real problem is the government’s relentless pursuit of a Net Zero policy the country cannot afford.The fuel poverty problem as it affects electrically heated low-income households is largely the creation of government policies and in particular the £10 billion a year subsidy cost of renewables, one-third of which hits households through their electricity bills and the remainder through the general cost of living as businesses pass on their costs.Mr Kwarteng’s measures are wholly inadequate, barely scratching the surface of the electricity bill issue, and leaving the cost of living problem caused by his climate policies quite untouched.

886,"A member of London mayor Sadiq Khan’s new commission reviewing statues, street names, and other memorials once interrupted a church service to scream at the Queen and threatened to “punch out” security.British-Nigerian activist Toyin Agbetu was already working on the BLM-inspired Review, Rename, Reclaim naming review for the municipal authorities in the London borough of Hackney — represented by Labour’s Diane Abbott in Parliament — but was thrust into the spotlight by his appointment to Mayor Khan’s so-called Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm, which will be conducting a similar audit of statues and memorials for the entire capital.An investigation into the background of the Commission’s members, described as “almost entirely… left-wing political activists, campaigners, and celebrities, instead of historians and experts” by Conservative parliamentarian Andrew Rosindell, soon revealed Agbetu as its most controversial appointee, with the activist having made headlines in 2007 when he interrupted a Westminster Abbey service commemorating 200 years since Britain’s abolition of slave trade to shout at the Queen.“You should be ashamed!” he screams in video footage of the incident unearthed by the Guido Fawkes blog, as he is ushered away by security personnel and clergymen, jabbing his finger in the face of one guard — a black man — and threatening “I’ll punch you out!” London, UNITED KINGDOM: Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II (top R) watches as a protestor, named by local media as Toyin Agbetu, is led out after interrupting proceedings to mark the bicentenary of the 1807 act to abolish the slave trade, attended by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Tony Blair, at Westminster Abbey in central London 27 March 2007. Trade in black slaves was banned throughout the British empire by the 1807 law, imposing a fine of 100 pounds for any slave found on any British boat. Slavery was completely outlawed in British colonies in 1833. AFP PHOTO/ REUTERS/Stephen Hird/Pool (Photo credit should read STEPHEN HIRD/AFP via Getty Images) Writing in the Socialist Review shortly after the stunt, Agbetu condemned Britain’s commemoration of its historic abolition of the slave trade as not only “an act of astonishing arrogance [from] the British church, monarchy and government” but “an orgy of hypocritical moral profligacy where they neglected to apologise, or reparate”.A spokesman for Mayor Khan’s office has defended Agbetu’s appointment to the statues commission, however, saying that the teaching assistant was chosen “for his significant expertise, knowledge and experience as a social rights activist and in setting up Ligali, which challenges the misrepresentation of African people and culture in the media.”“His vast experience will provide a valuable contribution to the commission,” they added.As a recent example of this experience includes attending a protest against a statue of Sir Robert Geffrye, a former Lord Mayor of London and philanthropist born in the 1600s, and shouting “Geffrye must fall!” through a megaphone, some may question whether his “valuable contribution” to the question of what should be done with historic memorials is a foregone conclusion.ImmigrationLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeAndrew RosindellBritainBritish HistoryCommission for Diversity in the Public RealmCommunity CohesiondiversityElizabeth IIHeritageHistoryIconoclasmlabourLabour PartyLigaliLondonMulticulturalismNational Identitysadiq khanSJWsSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorsstatuesThe queenToyin AgbetuUnited KingdomWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
887,"Kehinde Andrews, the “Black Studies” professor who slated Churchill as a “white supremacist” and said the British Empire was “far worse” than Nazi Germany, has been accused of racially abusing black conservatives by activist and educator Calvin Robinson.“I just think the solution [to divisions in society] is easy, we just need to come together,” said Robinson, of the Policy Exchange think tank and Don’t Divide Us campaign, while on a panel with Andrews on BBC show The Big Questions.“[Y]es, there has been an increase in racism this year; I’ve personally experienced more racism this year than I have in my entire adult life,” he continued, prompting the presenter to cut in and exclaim “Well that’s extraordinary!” — before Robinson explained where the racism was coming from: “–and that is because of Black Lives Matter and Critical Race Theory being pushed.”“This idea that there’s an ‘appropriate’ way to be black — for example, I’m often called, by Professor Andrews, ‘Bounty’, ‘Uncle Tom’, ‘House Negro’, for not having the right opinion,” Robinson alleges in an edited clip of the segment he shared on social media.“You haven’t said that, have you?” the BBC presenter asks Andrews in Robinson’s cut of their exchange.“Not about Calvin,” Andrews replies with a chuckle.“Oh, you’ve said it about some people?” the presenter follows up.“Some of those terms, not all of them,” Andrews admits.“It’s wrong. We need to accept that black people, all people, should be diverse, we should have different thoughts and opinions; we shouldn’t expect people to think the same because of the colour of their skin,” Robinson fires back.“That is racist. That’s what’s dividing us. We need to come back together and say, actually, it doesn’t matter what colour we are, we’re all British, we’re all here together, and that’s the thing that unites us.”The idea that all black people should think alike is racist, evidenced by the comments I receive: uncle Tom, bounty, etc.Stop letting people divide us based on the colour of our skin!We should focus on the things that unite us; we’re all British.  pic.twitter.com/f7hBmSvhXs— Calvin Robinson (@calvinrobinson) February 14, 2021Andrews’ recent sally against Churchill and the British Empire which he led against Hitler’s Germany is by no means his only foray into identity politics, with academic venues, the BBC, and various other mainstream media outlets regularly wheeling him out to denigrate various aspects of British and Western history, culture, and society as racist.Prior to Churchill, targets for his ire have included the British national anthem (during which sportsmen should “take a knee” or “clench a fist” because the British flag is a symbol of “oppression”), the patriotic song Rule, Britannia (“racist propaganda”), portraits of the Queen (“she is the premier symbol of empire and colonial violence“), and the St George’s flag of England (“something like the Confederate flag”), among others.Andrews and Robinson have crossed swords before, with the latter having recently describing the “Black Studies” professor’s latest book, The New Age of Empire: How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World, as “preposterous” in a scathing review.“[Andrews’] premise is that everything and everyone is racist, there is no solution, and we should all subscribe to the principles of Critical Race Theory,” Robinson suggests.“It means that white people should be apologising for the mistakes of their ancestors, and black people should be raging in anger or brooding in a victimhood mentality.”Churchill College Hosts Anti-Churchill Talk: 'Embodiment of White Supremacy', British Empire 'Far Worse' Than Nazis https://t.co/a6eTjrqL4u— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeBritish EmpireBritish HistoryCalvin RobinsonCommunity CohesinCritical Race TheoryCulture Warculture warsdiversityDiversity of OpinionDiversity of ThoughtHeritageIconoclasmIdentity PoliticsKehinde AndrewsMass MigrationMulticulturalismNational IdentitypatriotismracismSJWsSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorsstatuesWinston ChurchillWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
888,"Churchill College at the University of Cambridge hosted an online talk in which academics claimed that Winston Churchill was a white supremacist and the British Empire “far worse” than Nazi Germany.In the Zoom “discussion” titled, arguably inaccurately, The Racial Consequences of Mr Churchill — as a knight of the realm the wartime leader’s proper title is ‘Sir’ rather than ‘Mister’ — academics Priyamvada Gopal, Onyeka Nubia, Kehinde Andrews, and Madhusree Mukerjee all appeared to share a profoundly negative view of the British leader.Gopal, who gained a degree of public infamy after tweeting that “White Lives Don’t Matter. As white lives” in 2020 — over 20,000 people signed a Change.org petition calling for the India-born academic to be fired before the website took it down, but Churchill College instead promoted her to a full professorship — lead much of the “discussion”.Her own initial contribution to it focused largely on attempting to justify why the uniformly anti-Churchill panel was not unbalanced, but she made it clear in the aftermath of the event that it is very much her view that Churchill was “manifestly” a “white supremacist”.I've done a lot of word mincing in recent days, so let me answer the Mail's charge that this was an 'accusation'  (by @kehinde_andrews, but I think the rest of us also referred to this) Was Churchill a white supremacist?If we just go by his own words, manifestly so. https://t.co/W2bC5zQEAD— Priyamvada Gopal (@PriyamvadaGopal) February 12, 2021Onyeka Nubia began by tracing Churchill’s English fatherline to the 1400s and his American motherline to “Huguenot stock”, suggesting that this bloodline “helps us to understand much about the nature of ethnicity in the timeframe of which Churchill was born and lived… an ethnicity or an ethnic identity that is framed on a European hegemony that we might now say was a white supremacist philosophy.”Nubia went on the critique Churchill’s use of the term “Anglo-Saxon race” in his books — “there is no such thing, of course” — and to accuse him of having “strong ideal about ethnicity and race” which were “particular to a kind of Anglophile, Eurocentric, white supremacist perspective”.Madhusree Mukerjee, a Germany-based, Indian-born physicist who wrote a much-disputed book laying much of the blame for the Bengal Famine at Churchill’s doorstop, focused much of her talk on that humanitarian disaster — leaving the fact that much of the rice crop had been devastated by a cyclone and a catastrophic outbreak of fungal disease off her slides listing its causes.Mukerjee also claimed that “Hitler was inspired by the British Empire” and that “militarism is at the core of the British identity”, saying of London’s historic monuments: “those statues need to come down”.She also appeared to dismiss Britain’s role in the defeat of the Axis powers, saying “of course it was the Soviet Union that defeated the Nazis and the Americans who defeated the Japanese” — completely overlooking the vital contribution of British and Empire forces to the Arctic convoys, the D-Day landings, and the African and South-East Asian theatres.Churchill’s sole personal contribution to the war effort, she surmised, was that if anyone other than him had been in Downing Street the Bengal Famine would have been less severe.Both speakers dragged up politically incorrect remarks made by — or attributed to — Churchill, who was born in 1874, in an effort to prove his was alleged supremacist views, particularly with respect to Indians, but neither quoted his statement in 1943, the year of the Bengal Famine, that “The old idea that the Indian was in any way inferior to the white man must go.

889,"BEIJING (AP) – The European Union on Saturday called on China to reverse its ban on the BBC World News television channel imposed in apparent retaliation for Britain’s pulling of the license of state-owned Chinese broadcaster CGTN.The EU said in a statement that Beijing’s move further restricted “freedom of expression and access to information inside its borders,” and violated both the Chinese constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The statement also said that Hong Kong’s announcement that its public broadcaster would also stop carrying BBC broadcasts added to the “erosion of the rights and freedoms that is ongoing” in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory since the imposition last year of a sweeping new national security law.“The EU remains strongly committed to safeguarding media freedom and pluralism, as well as protecting the right to freedom of expression online and offline, including freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information without interference of any kind,” the statement said.While Britain is no longer in the EU, it remains a member of the Council of Europe, which oversees a 1989 agreement linking broadcasting licenses. Britain, the U.S. and foreign correspondents based in China have also expressed dismay over the BBC ban.China’s move Thursday was largely symbolic, because BBC World was shown only on cable TV systems in hotels and apartment compounds for foreigners and some other businesses. However, it comes against the backdrop of growing conflict between Beijing and Western governments over a slew of issues ranging from human rights to trade and the COVID-19 pandemic in which Chinese criticisms over foreign media coverage have played a prominent role.China’s National Radio and Television Administration said BBC World News coverage of the country violated requirements that news reporting be true and impartial, reflecting complaints over BBC reports about the government’s initial response to the virus outbreak in China. Other complaints were over allegations of forced labour and sexual abuse in the north-western Chinese region of Xinjiang, home to Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups. The EU statement specifically linked the ban to BBC reporting on those topics.BBC World News Banned from Airing in China https://t.co/Azu1PSDew2— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 12, 2021It wasn’t clear whether BBC reporters in China would be affected.

890,"BERLIN (AP) – German prosecutors said Monday they have charged five Tajik men with being members of the Islamic State group, accusing them of participating in a cell of the extremist organization in Germany.Federal prosecutors filed the indictment at the Duesseldorf state court, where an alleged associate of the five was convicted last month of membership in IS for co-founding the German cell and supporting two planned attacks. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.The suspects now charged were identified only as Farhodshoh K., Muhammadali G., Azizjon B., Sunatullokh K. and Komron B., in keeping with German privacy rules.Prosecutors say that Azizjon B. administered propaganda channels and helped collect money for a Russian- and Tajik-language IS online network. They say he also personally recruited IS members, leading to the founding of a cell in western Germany in early 2019 that aimed to carry out attacks in Germany.The rest of the accused – along with Ravsan B., the man convicted last month – are alleged to have belonged to that cell.Prosecutors say that they trained their military skills in paintball games, and that participants in those included “other people from the Islamist scene” who were in contact with the gunman who killed four people in an attack in Vienna in November. They also allegedly acquired components for an “unconventional” bomb.Farhodshoh K. and Ravsan B. are accused of traveling to Albania in 2019 to carry out a contract killing that was intended to finance IS to the tune of $40,000. That killing was called off because doubts arose over the intended victim´s identity.The indictment alleges that Ravsan B. then gave Sunatullokh K. the semi-automatic pistol intended for that killing to shoot a man in Germany who had made critical comments about Islam – an attack that was foiled by authorities.It says that the cell then changed its strategy, concentrating on radicalizing and recruiting young Muslims in Germany and raising money for IS.London / EuropeDuesseldorfGermanyIslamIslamic StateTajikistanterrorism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
891,"Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson has said “muddle-headed lefties” should stop dragging Britain’s name through the mud and highlight its dangerous and expensive crusade to stamp out global slavery.The broadcaster took aim at the BLM-inspired fad among publicly-funded bodies such as Historic England for pouring resources into attempting to connect swathes of Britain’s heritage with supposed misdeed, and so on — for example by creating a list of village halls, churches, pubs and so on which were supposedly touched by the “slavery economy”.“Right. Good. This was excellent research, and I’m sure the people who live in these places are now burning their houses and pubs and schools down and moving, with their heads bowed in shame, to an area that was never involved in slavery. Spain, perhaps, or Portugal,” Clarkson remarked — perhaps not entirely sincerely — in an article for the Sunday Times.“In the meantime, I’ve been doing some research of my own about the Royal Navy’s West Africa Squadron,” he went on, referring to the once-famed armada which spearheaded Britain’s efforts to stamp out the Atlantic slave trade globally.“Britannia claimed that it ruled the waves, and Britannia was going to damn well prove the point,” he said, highlighting in particular the story of the HMS Black Joke, a former Brazilian slave trader repurposed by the British for its swiftness.“In one engagement it spent 31 hours chasing a Spanish brig called El Almirante that was en route to Havana. When the British finally caught up, they realised that their two tiny guns were no match for the 14 monsters that the Spaniards could muster. But after little more than an hour, 15 of the El Almirante’s crew, including the captain, were dead, and the remainder had surrendered,” he wrote, lamenting the fact that schoolchildren never hear tell of the Black Joke’s daring captain, Henry Downes — “I suppose his story doesn’t tally with current thinking.”“I guess that muddle-headed lefties really don’t like the idea that for nearly a hundred years, and at vast expense, the country that they hate waged easily the most morally just war of all time,” Clarkson concluded acidly.Between 1808 and 1860 over 150,000 people were liberated from the slave trade by the West Africa Squadron. #BlackAndBritish pic.twitter.com/FyRTtk5yit— BBC Two (@BBCTwo) November 23, 2016While the activities of the West Africa Squadron, which “swallow[ed] up 13 per cent of the navy’s manpower  [and] cost far more than Britain earned from its earlier slaving enterprises”, according to Clarkson, is the probably Britain’s best-remembered initiative against the slave trade — which is perhaps not saying much in an era obsessed with emphasising only the (real or imagined) crimes of the former empire — it was not alone.Clarkson touched upon the Royal Navy’s efforts against the Arab Muslim-run slave trade in East Africa — almost entirely neglected by activist academics and schools alike, although it endured for far longer than the Atlantic slave trade and is believed to have been much deadlier to enslaved than even the infamous Middle Passage. British abolitionists such as Dr David Livingstone and Dr John Kirk were also vital in closing down the East African trade.Britain played a key role in stamping out an even more inconvenient slave hub — that of the Muslim rulers of North Africa, who for centuries carried European Christians off from ships and coastal settlements, largely in the Mediterranean but also from Great Britain, Ireland, and even faraway Iceland, to live out lives of brutal toil or sexual slavery on the Barbary Coast.It took a fleet of British ships, aided by the Dutch and led by Lord Exmouth, a hero of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, to put an end to this trade — for the most part — and free North Africa’s white slaves, after a deadly battle with Dey of Algiers.Britain was also instrumental in ending the widely ignored practice of slavery among Africans themselves, with Boy Scouts founder Robert Baden-Powell, for example, having participated in an expedition against the Ashanti kingdom in the 1890s to “put a stop to slave trading and raiding”.The Ashanti ruler, Prempeh, preyed upon his neighbours not, for the most part, for want of labour, but for captives who could be used in human sacrifices.The expedition was not without its dangers for the British, and claimed the life of Queen Victoria’s own son-in-law, Prince Henry.BBC – History – British History in depth: British Slaves on the Barbary Coast https://t.co/ATBiclTz6t— Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) August 18, 2019AfricaLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBarbary CoastBarbary PiratesBritainBritish HistoryHeritageHistoric EnglandHistoryjeremy clarksonNational IdentityNational pridenorth africaRobert Baden-PowellRoyal NavySJWsSlave TradeSlaverySlavessocial justice warriorsUnited KingdomWest Africa SquadronWokewokenessWokismZanzibar.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

893,"A group of asylum seekers being housed at the expense of the British taxpayer in a Reading hotel have staged a hunger strike, protesting against the quality of the free food they are given.One of the migrants leading the strike, Salahe Lakhdar, claimed that the food was unhealthy and the portions too small, leading to some of the migrants losing weight.Lakhdar, who said he has been staying in the hotel for three months, told Sky News: “These people have been living in the hotel for nine months without going anywhere, without seeing any family, without seeing friends, without doing any activities.“We know it’s bad for everyone, for UK residents, and we respect that and we wish them the very best and we hope this time passes soon — but it’s very bad for these people as well,” he suggested.The 24-year-old migrant claimed some in the hotel have experienced medical issues as a result of the food, alleging that “many people” have gone to the hospital as a result of the food.Lakhdar said he wants “some sign” from the government that their supposed plight has been heard, and that their asylum claims will be progressed.Sky News: ‘Desperate’ Migrants In Glasgow Stabbing Hotel Unhappy with ‘Limited WiFi’, ‘Poor’ Food https://t.co/DrWDSvtUAk— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 26, 2020Another unnamed migrant, who is staying in the hotel with her daughter said: “It’s been miserable… she hasn’t eaten healthy food for over five months — no vegetables, no fresh milk, no cheese, no egg, no fish. Imagine a kid who is growing and needs all this protein and calcium — she doesn’t get any of this.”“For the first time in my whole life I’ve had suicidal thoughts… and there are so many suicidal people in the same place,” she added — suggesting her previous circumstances cannot have been that desperate.Clearsprings Ready Homes, a firm that services migrant detention centres said that “Clearsprings ensures that where required, three meals a day are provided.“The food service provided by our suppliers is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure what is provided meets the required standards and that feedback from our asylum seekers is taken into account as part of that review.”Illegal Migrants Unhappy with Free Accommodation in 'Racist' UK Want to Return to EU https://t.co/xBqAni6Zct— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2021In July, Brexit leader Nigel Farage uncovered the fact that the government has been housing illegal migrants in hotels during the Chinese coronavirus crisis, amid record-breaking waves of illegal boat migration.Mr Farage later embarrassed the government after revealing that one of the migrant hotels was in Home Secretary Priti Patel’s own constituency.Aside from the financial cost of housing migrants — expected to total at least  £4 billion over the coming years— the hotel housing scheme has had some violent consequences.In June, a Sudanese migrant went on a stabbing spree inside his Glasgow hotel, wounding six people, including a police officer, David Whyte, who was critically injured.The attacker, Badreddin Abadlla Adam, had also reportedly complained about the free food he was provided, which sometimes consisted of spaghetti or macaroni and cheese, which was deemed not to be “culturally appropriate” by local activists.Migrants have long complained about the free accommodation provided to them by the British taxpayer. In September, a group of illegal Sudanese migrants complained about their housing at a converted British Army barracks, telling the media that they “wished they stayed in France“.Others have staged violent protests and hunger strikes at the camp.In January, a group of five asylum seekers were arrested in connection with an arson attack on the facility.Glasgow Migrant Hotel Stabber Named as Badreddin Abadlla Adam https://t.co/VRUCSbrw4B— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 28, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsasylum seekersBoat MigrantsChannel CrisisChannel MigrantsCommunity CohesiondiversityEurope Migrant CrisisFolkestoneIllegal AliensIllegal Immigrantsillegal immigrationMass MigrationMigrant BoatsMigrant CrisisMigrant HotelsMigrantsMulticulturalismreadingSocial CohesionUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

895,"At least ten former staff members are ready to come forward as claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex bullied and “humiliated” aides are probed.Allegations that Meghan, the former Suits starlet and wife of Prince Harry, inflicted “emotional cruelty and manipulation” on staff are being investigated by Buckingham Palace, after a former aide revealed she had been the subject of a bullying complaint and accused her of driving a number of people out of their jobs.“A group of people are queuing up to be involved. They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face.

The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
896,"(AFP) — New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ordered the country’s biggest city Auckland into a snap lockdown for the first time in nearly six months on Sunday after three coronavirus cases emerged in the community.The Pacific island nation has been widely praised for its handling of the pandemic, with just 25 deaths in a population of five million.But almost two million residents were told on Sunday to stay at home from midnight, when the level-three lockdown begins, with schools and businesses to close except for essential services.“The main thing we are asking people in Auckland to do is stay at home to avoid any risk of spread,” Ardern said.She added that the restrictions were “just in case it could be one of the more transmissible strains of Covid that we need to act with a high degree of caution around”.It came after three members of an Auckland family tested positive, with authorities concerned about the “new and active” infections as there was no obvious source of transmission.The city will also be ring-fenced from the rest of New Zealand, with travel in and out of the metropolis highly restricted for the next three days.The remainder of the country will move to alert level two, Ardern said, with people required to wear masks on public transport and gatherings limited to a maximum of 100 people.“I know we all feel the same way when this happens — not again,” she said.“But remember, we have been here before, that means we know how to get out of this — together.”New Zealand Stands with China: Cautions Ally Australia to ‘Show Respect’ to Beijing https://t.co/HEwhXwMIUZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 28, 2021Too soon to judge Health officials said a mother — who works for a company providing laundry and catering services to international flights — and her daughter tested positive Saturday, before the father returned a positive sample Sunday.A fourth member of the household is also showing symptoms of Covid-19 but returned a negative test.New Zealand director-general of health Ashley Bloomfield said the initial focus was on the mother’s workplace “because of its obvious connections to the border”.But he added it was “too soon to rule in or out” any source of transmission and the woman had not been at work for eight days before testing positive.Auckland spent more than two weeks in lockdown last August after a virus outbreak was linked to a worker at a coolstore handling imported frozen freight, but New Zealand has largely been enjoying relaxed restrictions for months.Several cases of Covid-19 were also detected in the city three weeks ago, before being traced back to a hotel where the people had completed quarantine after arriving from overseas.Ardern has been widely praised for her management of the pandemic, with New Zealand recording fewer than 2,000 infections.The country closed its borders and implemented a strict five-week lockdown in March and April last year, with occasional virus outbreaks since then being quickly contained.Ardern has said New Zealand’s borders were likely to remain closed for the rest of this year while the pandemic continued to rage worldwide.New Zealand: Police Website to Inform on Neighbours Breaking Lockdown So Popular It Crashes https://t.co/uPk6VY21Hl— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 30, 2020 HealthLondon / EuropeScienceAntipodesAucklandBritish CommonwealthcoronavirusCOVID-19Jacinda ArdernlockdownlockdownsNew ZealandpandemicWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
897,"European Commissioner for Migration Ylva Johansson admitted that just a third of bogus, rejected asylum seekers return to their home countries — and less than a third go voluntarily.The figures released earlier this week showed that around 70 per cent of illegitimate asylum applicants manage to stay in the European Union despite their claims being rejected.“When it comes to how [EU] member-states can improve the process, they must ensure that a refusal decision comes at the same time as a return decision,” Ms Johansson said following the report’s publication, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.“The right to seek asylum is fundamental. People have the right to have their case heard. But we also must have a functioning return system. And that’s why I’m putting so much focus right now on returns,” Johansson claimed.Spanish Canary Islands See ‘Unsustainable’ 700 Per Cent Rise in Migrants https://t.co/wFSHvA7WME— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 8, 2020The report revealed that in 2020, despite the Wuhan virus pandemic and travel restrictions implemented by many countries, a total of 110,000 immigrants entered the European Union illegally.While Greece saw a dramatic decline in asylum seekers in 2020, Italy saw a steady flow of migrants under the post-Salvini government, particularly to the island of Lampedusa in the summer months.Spain, specifically the Canary Islands off the west coast of Africa, saw the largest increase last year, with the islands seeing a record 8,000 migrants land illegally in November alone.Voluntary repatriation, accompanied by resettlement assistance, has been offered by many countries in recent years, but the number of migrants who have embraced the various schemes EU member-states have offered is limited.Last year, Greece began offering asylum seekers on overwhelmed islands in the Aegean 2,000 euros to return to their own countries.

898,"BERLIN (AP) – Germany on Sunday implemented tighter border controls on its frontiers with the Czech Republic and Austria’s Tyrol province in an effort to stem the spread of more contagious coronavirus variants.The new restrictions that took effect at midnight limit entry from those areas to German citizens and residents, truck drivers, transport and health service staff and a few others, who have to register online and show a negative coronavirus test.Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper that the new checks may cause some delays at the border and German police “will not just wave traffic through.”Infection rates in Germany have been declining steadily in recent weeks but officials are concerned about the possible impact of variants first discovered in Britain and South Africa. Both variants have been reported in Germany but so far appear to account for just a small proportion of cases.Significant numbers of cases of the latter have been discovered in Tyrol, whose residents have needed to show a recent negative coronavirus test to travel to the rest of Austria since Friday. The spread of the British variant has prompted a complete lockdown of some Czech districts on the border with Germany and Poland.To prevent a pile-up of trucks inside Austria, regional officials in Tyrol planned to check trucks headed for Germany at the Brenner pass crossing with Italy to ensure that drivers have the necessary paperwork to enter Germany.German Vice-Chancellor Reportedly Slams 'Really S***' EU Vaccine Programme https://t.co/GVv3CedxOR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany’s 16 state governors agreed on Wednesday to extend most of the country’s lockdown restrictions until March 7, though schools and hairdressers can open sooner.They set a new target of 35 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week before letting small stores, museums and other businesses reopen. That figure stood at 57.4 on Sunday, down from a peak of nearly 200 just before Christmas.The eastern state of Saxony’s governor cautioned Germans against expecting too much too soon.“Unfortunately, there can’t be Easter vacations in Germany this year,” Michael Kretschmer was quoted as telling Bild am Sonntag. “Too much mobility as a result of travel and tourism already in April would be poison. We would destroy everything we have achieved since mid-December.”Hotels and restaurants in Saxony, which was hard hit in the fall and winter, will have to remain shut over Easter, and the reopening of theatres and operas will have to wait until after Easter, he said.EU Commissioner: Fewer Than One Third of Bogus Asylum Seekers Go Back Voluntarily https://t.co/SvUWNh7ub3— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2021HealthLondon / EuropePoliticsAngela MerkelborderscoronavirusCOVID-19EasterEUEuropean UnionFree movementGermanypandemicSchengenSchengen agreementSchengen AreaSchengen ZoneWuhan virus.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
899,"Players for Scotland and Wales all remained standing ahead of their Six Nations rugby match on Saturday, defying uproar over many players not kneeling to Black Lives Matter at the earlier Scotland vs England fixture.While players for England — with some notable exceptions — decided to “take a knee” for Black Lives Matter before facing off against the Scots team in their home stadium, only a handful of Scottish players followed suit.The Scots went on to heft the Calcutta Cup after soundly defeating the English team — their first win over their much larger neighbour on English soil since 1983 — but the fact they had largely shunned the kneeling to BLM which has become ritual in many sports, and in particular football, before the game triggered a woke backlash.“#AsOne is the message from Scottish Rugby. But the players don’t seem to be ‘as one’ in their stance against racism,” sniped Sky Sports News editor Anthony Joseph.“It’s less about ‘they should kneel’ and more about ‘why wouldn’t they?’” he added, despite the fact that athletes’ decision to knee — or not — is supposed to be a personal one, and a subject for interrogation.Rather than buckle under the pressure, however, the Scots’ stance on kneeling appears to have hardened following the outcry, with none of the players for their team or the Welsh national team kneeling ahead of their own Six Nations clash.Woke Outrage as Few Scotland Players Kneel to BLM Before Historic Rugby Win over England https://t.co/miJe5dfHZF— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021“There’s a moment to reflect, there are messages going up on the screens, everyone is watching on TV, they’re not at the stadium,” commented Gregor Townsend MBE, the Scottish team coach, ahead of the match, in reference to the “moment of reflection” the teams observed, on their feet, in lieu of bending the knee.“It’s what rugby has chosen to do and we’ll follow that,” he insisted.The match between the two Celtic nations proved to be a hard-fought struggle, with the Welsh winning by just one point — 25-24 — after being down significantly before half-time.The Scots were hamstrung by the loss of a player to a red card in the second half, but did manage to regain the lead for a time despite this deficit with a try from the team captain.Wales’s win takes them to the top of the leaderboard as the Six Nations tournament — between Scotland, England, Wales, Ireland, France, and Italy — continues.Rugby Star Refused to Kneel for BLM for 'Burning Churches and Bibles' https://t.co/6IhzKB6kGY— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 22, 2020London / EuropeSocial JusticeSportsBlack Lives MatterBlack Lives Matter UKBLMdiversityEnglandkneelingMulticulturalismNational prideracismrugbyscotlandSix NationsSJWsSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorstake a kneeTaking a KneeWalesWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
900,"A British has blocked efforts by Priti Patel’s Home Office to deport a double rapist from Somalia on grounds that he would not receive proper mental healthcare in his native country.The 49-year-old migrant claimed asylum in Britain after arriving in the country in 2004, however, the Home Office sought to deport the man after he was convicted of eight criminal offences over the course of six years, including the rape of two women.The Somali national was sentenced to a meagre seven years in prison for rape at knifepoint before being put in immigration detention.According to the Daily Mail, an immigration tribunal judgment heard: “While at HMP Stafford he was not able always to behave appropriately. On several occasions after January 2017 he was placed in segregation, his attitude and behaviour being aggressive and unacceptable.”The migrant was also deemed to pose a “high risk of serious harm” to the British public — yet the British judiciary blocked the Home Office twice from deporting him citing mental health issues which they argued would not be adequately addressed in Somalia.In the first hearing an immigration judge blocked his deportation, saying that mental healthcare in Somalia was “extremely poor” and adding that “those with mental health issues, particularly those who are aggressive, were often stigmatised, considered ‘possessed’, and subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment within both society and families, including stoning and chaining.”The Home Office appealed the decision, but Judge Judith Gleeson rejected the appeal, saying: “The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error on a point of law.”The Conservative-led Home Office, for its part, appears to have given no indication that it intends to press for changes to the laws which allow such decisions in Parliament, where Conservative leader Boris Johnson won a majority of 80 in 2019.Judges Block Deportation of Knife Killer Migrant on ‘Human Rights’ Grounds https://t.co/xVLlkMSk8y— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 23, 2020British judges have often blocked the deportation of foreign national offenders and illegal aliens over the past years.Last February, for example, a judge blocked the deportation of mostly Jamaican criminals, including a rapist and a killer because they briefly lacked access to mobile phones while they were detained.A judge in Scotland also halted the deportation of a Taliban fighter in June on the grounds that he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) while fighting for the Islamist terror group in Afganistan and would not receive the care he supposedly required in his home country.In another stunning example of judicial activism, the Court of Appeal decided that it would “not be fair” to deport a Zimbabwean paedophile because the government’s lawyers supposedly took to long to present the correct justification for his removal.More recently, a group of alleged “activist lawyers” successfully convinced judges to remove 23 illegal migrants from a Home Office charter deportation flight in December.The Conservative government has long promised to step up deportations and to change laws to prevent judicial activists from thwarting their efforts. However, under the leadership of tough-talking Home Secretary Priti Patel, deportations actually fell by over 4,000 in 2020, representing a 79 per cent decline over the previous year.UK: ‘Activist Lawyers’ Block Deportation of Every Single Migrant on Planned Removal Flight https://t.co/QOt5PCzfHT— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 28, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaCrimeImmigrationLondon / EuropeBritish deportationsBritish judgesBritish JudiciarydeportationsEurope Migrant Crisisforeign criminalshome officeIllegal Immigrantsjudicial activismMigrantspriti patelRapistSomali immigrantsSomali refugeesSomaliaUK migrantsUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

902,"Britain’s socialised healthcare system has reportedly been issuing do not resuscitate orders for people with learning disabilities during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.The Royal Mencap Society, a top charity for people with learning disabilities, claimed that it had received reports in January from people with mental handicaps who said that they were told if they contracted the coronavirus, they would not be resuscitated.Mencap’s chief executive, Edel Harris, told The Guardian: “Throughout the pandemic many people with a learning disability have faced shocking discrimination and obstacles to accessing healthcare, with inappropriate Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) notices put on their files and cuts made to their social care support.“It’s unacceptable that within a group of people hit so hard by the pandemic, and who even before Covid died on average over 20 years younger than the general population, many are left feeling scared and wondering why they have been left out.“The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) and government must act now to help save the lives of some of society’s most vulnerable people by urgently prioritising all people with a learning disability for the vaccine,” Harris concluded.According to Public Health England (PHE), young people between the ages of 18 and 34 with learning disabilities are 30 times more likely to die from the coronavirus than their non-disabled counterparts.Last week, NHS figures showed that in the first five weeks of the third national lockdown, some 65 per cent of deaths of people with learning disabilities were caused by the coronavirus.Delingpole: Killing the Elderly In Care Homes to Save the NHS. Nice Work, Boris! https://t.co/r85p6p9qPz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 19, 2020In December, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said that there was “evidence of unacceptable and inappropriate” use of DNACPR orders from NHS doctors during the first wave of the pandemic leading to avoidable deaths.The United Kingdom’s care watchdog went on to warn that despite widespread outrage over media reports, there was evidence to suggest that the policy remained in place. The CQC is set to publish another report on the scandal within the coming weeks.In some instances, families of sick patients were told that their relatives had consented to the do not resuscitate orders, however, it was unclear whether it was “informed consent” as some patients, such as deaf people or those who don’t speak English, may not have understood the full implications.The same communication problems have apparently affected those with learning disabilities.A consultant in learning disability psychiatry in Leeds, Dr Keri-Michèle Lodge, said: “Doctors often don’t understand that someone with learning disabilities may not be able to communicate their symptoms. Carers are sometimes not listened to – you might notice something is wrong, but that is often written off as part of their behaviour.”“People with learning disabilities already get a raw deal from the health services. Fewer than two in five people with a learning disability live until they are 65.”The Office for National Statistics reported last week that 5.8 per cent of all coronavirus deaths were people with some form of disability, despite only making up 1.2 per cent of the study population.Dr Lodge said: “The biggest factor associated with the increased rate of death from their analysis was living in care homes or residential settings.“They prioritised people in care homes for vaccinations, but that was only for older adults. They completely forgot about people with learning disabilities in a really similar setting.

The paper cites neighbours who described the photographer’s model as a “lovely girl, very pretty”, who had recently entered into beauty contests.Just three hours after the attack, police were able to arrest a suspect in the case, takin a 19-year-old Afghan refugee into custody.""was described by authorities as 'an example of successful integration'… He was even featured in a campaign by Swiss authorities to promote positive integration."" https://t.co/IgNsmNjLXz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 28, 2020Georges-André Lozouet, spokesman for the cantonal police in Neuchâtel, stated that police were not certain of the motive for the acid attack and stated, “Whether the suspect and the victim know each other and how they relate to each other, I cannot say at this time.”A prosecutor has opened criminal proceedings against the 19-year-old Afghan and police have reached out to the public for any information and any witnesses who may have seen the attack take place.The case comes just months after residents of Neuchâtel called on police to act against criminal migrants in the area, stating that they would sort the matter out themselves if no action occurred.Acid attacks are relatively rare in Switzerland, but in the UK they have become a major issue in recent years, particularly in London which has been labelled a “hotspot” for acid attacks in the western world in 2019.London’s Metropolitan Police Service recorded 66 acid attacks in 2012 but the number had risen to 752 in 2018, a ten-fold increase in just six years.Associate professor of criminology Dr Simon Harding stated that acid had been used in a number of different types of crimes and said, “London has sadly become the acid attack hotspot in the western world.”Swiss Townsfolk Tell Authorities: Sort Out Migrant Crime or We Will https://t.co/2TplFdMUcn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 27, 2020ImmigrationLaw and OrderLondon / EuropeAcid Attackacid attacksAfghan migrantsasylum seekersmigrant crimeNeuchâtelSwitzerland.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
905,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
906,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage has warned that the Labour Party will face electoral ruin if it fails to rein in the Black Lives Matter inspired attack on British heritage by London mayor Sadiq Khan.In response to the unveiling of Khan’s left-wing activist Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm, a board which will target statues, street names, memorials, and building names in the British capital, Mr Farage warned that the Labour Party will suffer an even greater defeat than the historic losses seen under elderly socialist Jeremy Corbyn.He said that if Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer “cannot rein in Khan, his identity politics, and his willful adoption of cancel culture, then the Labour Party will lose by even more votes at the next election than Jeremy Corbyn did at the last.”Mr Farage said that the members of Mr Khan’s commission “are clearly intent on absolutely redrawing the history of one of the greatest and most successful cities in the world.”The Reform UK party leader pointed to social rights activist Toyin Agbetu, who disrupted a celebration to honour the abolition of slavery in Britain — a world-leading achievement — to heckle the Queen, shouting: “You should be ashamed!” and “This is an insult to us!”WATCH: Khan Statues Adviser Screamed at Queen in Church, Threatened to 'Punch Out' Security  https://t.co/4lfF2Cvryz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021“I’m not sure he’s the kind of person who objectively can decide how London portrays its history, because it seems to me he pretty much hates the way the country is,” Farage said of Agbetu.He went on to criticise the London mayor for tapping left-wing British Pakistani Star Wars actor Riz Ahmed, who has said Prime Minister Boris Johnson is “overtly racist” and that a lack of diversity in media will lead teens to join Islamic State.Finally, Farage highlighted Lynette Nabbosa, who has claimed that white supremacy is a “uniquely British” characteristic, writing last October: “If you look back far enough (and not always that far), the UK seems to be the common denominator in atrocities across the world. No matter where you find examples of white supremacy, all roads lead back to my country of birth. It was racism that birthed slavery and colonialism.”Black Lives Matter disorder spread across the Atlantic with remarkable speed in 2020 after the death of George Floyd in the United States, with statues torn down or vandalized across the country and London plunged into violent disorder, despite lockdowns. https://t.co/WrQ4h1woVS— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 5, 2021Mr Farage shot back, questioning if she has “noticed what the French empire did to their colonies, what the Spanish empire did, what the Portuguese empire did — and don’t even start me on what the Germans tried to do twice to the world.”“Has she any idea that in relative terms the British empire was very benign compared to what everybody else in the world was doing? Do any of these people have a clue that when it comes to slavery, we were the country the first country, not just to abolish slavery, but to use the Royal Navy over decades to stop other countries from practising the slave trade?” he asked.“Of course our history contains episodes that we may not regard as being perfect today, but our history compared with virtually every other country is one that we can be very rightly proud of,” Farage declared.The Brexit leader said that ultimately, Sir Keir Starmer’s attempts to paint the Labour Party as more patriotic in order to win back the working class will fall flat if he fails to reign in the leftist London mayor.Churchill College Hosts Anti-Churchill Talk: 'Embodiment of White Supremacy', British Empire 'Far Worse' Than Nazis https://t.co/a6eTjrqL4u— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeBlack Lives MatterBlack Lives Matter UKBLMBritish EmpireBritish HistoryBritish politicsCancel CultureCommission for Diversity in the Public RealmCommunity CohesiondiversityHeritageHistoryIconoclasmKeir StarmerlabourLabour PartyLondonLynette NabbosaMass MigrationMulticulturalismNigel FarageRiz Ahmedsadiq khanSocial Cohesionstatue warsstatuesToyin AgbetuUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
907,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said that the British government will not commit to an “arbitrary” date to end lockdown, after a group of Conservatives has called for restrictions to be lifted after a large proportion of Britons have been vaccinated against coronavirus.Mr Raab, who also as First Secretary of State is the de facto deputy prime minister, made the remarks in response to the lockdown sceptic group of Tory MPs the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) calling for the lockdown to be ended in April, as by that time everyone over the age of 50 would have been offered the first dose of a vaccine. Those over 70 have now all been vaccinated, as well as those in other key at-risk groups.The foreign secretary told Sky News on Sunday that while it was the government’s aim to have offered the vaccine to those groups before the end of April, “I don’t think you can set an arbitrary target and not be evidence-led — which is why the review point on the 22nd of February is very important.”The senior minister said other measures could still be on track to be lifted in line with the government’s latest plans, including schools preparing to open for March 8th. The Johnson administration recommitted to the “review point” next week, as it would give schools a fortnight to prepare for reopening.Raab said that the government was “on course” to hit the first milestone of offering the first dose to the four most vulnerable groups by Monday, with every adult expected to have had their first shot by September.“That is the roadmap we set out. We need to be evidence-based in analysing our progress towards it,” Mr Raab said.“We’re not taking what feels to me a slightly arbitrary commitment without reviewing the impact the measures have had on transmission and the hospital admissions of the virus,” he reiterated.Coronavirus Patients with Learning Disabilities Given 'Do Not Resuscitate Orders' in Britain https://t.co/QamgJ0OOEU— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021The CRG, led by Mark Harper and Steve Baker, wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on behalf of its 63-strong membership of MPs to call for an end of restrictions by the end of April on grounds that if all groups over the age of 50 have been offered at least the first dose of the vaccine, then there would be “no justification” with continuing all measures. After March 8th, when the most vulnerable have been vaccinated and protected, Britons should see the beginning of the end of lockdown, the letter said.“All restrictions remaining after 8 March should be proportionate to the ever-increasing number of people we have protected,” it said, according to The Guardian.“The burden is on ministers to demonstrate the evidence of effectiveness and proportionality with a cost-benefit analysis for each restriction, and a roadmap for when they will be removed.”Reacting to Mr Raab twice calling the April deadline “arbitrary”, CRG Chairman Mr Harper asserted that “They’re not random, arbitrary timetables.”“It’s linked very much to the rollout of the vaccine. Once you have vaccinated the top nine groups who represent 99 per cent of the people who have sadly died from Covid and about 80 per cent of those who are seriously ill, I don’t think there is a justification for these draconian restrictions,” he told Times Radio.‘Totally Unacceptable’ – Illegal Migrants Getting Vaccines Before At-Risk Brits at 4-Star Hotel https://t.co/rCPhPXD1aO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2021When Prime Minster Johnson announced England’s third lockdown at the beginning of January, he was reticent to announce an end-date, putting into law measures that could last until the end of March before renewal. Since then, the prime minister and others have suggested that it was too early to say if restrictions could be lifted by Spring or even Summer, with one health expert recently claiming that some form of coronavirus measures could be in place for “years”.Writing in The Telegraph on Sunday, CRG Deputy Chairman Mr Baker said that as the risk from coronavirus is “diminishing” as Britain continues to successfully roll out its vaccine programme, “we must focus on how we open up society in the short run.“The priority is getting all pupils back into school by 8 March, opening hospitality by Easter and a free life by 1 May once we have vaccinated groups 1-9. Then we must ensure that any future restrictions undergo proper analysis and scrutiny.”Baker warned: “We cannot live in a society where lockdowns are perpetually on the table, in fear that a minister might, without notice, impose restrictions that cost people their jobs, their livelihoods, their ability to date, to marry, to visit family at home and abroad, or to invest in their futures.”Top Tory: Authorities Going Mad with ‘Unlimited Power’ After Children Ordered from Play Park https://t.co/CdJcsj6iM3— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 12, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19Dominic RaablockdownUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
908,"The Netherlands has halted all international adoptions after a study revealed that many children brought to the country had been stolen from their parents.A study by a government commission looked into adoptions from several countries including Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka between 1967 and 1998 and found that children had been taken from their parents. In some cases, the children were bought from their parents, who were facing pressure while suffering under poverty.The commission also noted that the Dutch government knew about the abuses as early as the 1960s. Some officials were even involved in the adoption abuses, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports.Legal Protection Minister Sander Dekker offered an official apology to those affected by the abuses earlier this week, stating that as a result of the findings, international adoptions would be halted for the time being.Dekker added that overturning the international adoptions moratorium was a job for the next administration.

909,"The British government will reportedly begin fining universities which embark on cancel culture-style infringements on freedom of speech, as well as mandate that heritage groups remain apolitical, in a major pushback against the Black Lives Matter-inspired attacks on British heritage.The UK’s Education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will announce this week the creation of a Free Speech Champion, who will be empowered to fine universities that attempt to discriminate against people for their political views.A government source told the Sunday Telegraph: “Free speech underpins our democratic society and our universities have a long and proud history of being places where students and academics can express themselves freely, challenge views and cultivate an open, inquiring mind.“Unacceptable silencing and censoring on campuses is having a chilling effect and that is why we must strengthen free speech in higher education, by bolstering the existing legal duties and ensuring strong, robust action is taken if these are breached.”In a recent notable example of cancel culture on campus, the University of Leicester announced in January that it would be removing its studies in Medieval English in favour of “decolonising” its curriculum. Rather than teaching Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales, the university said that it would focus on texts relating to sexuality, diversity, race, and ethnicity.The chairman of the Common Sense Group of Tory MPs welcomed the government’s defence of free speech on campus, warning that increasingly, debate has been shut down by the “thought police”.“It is absolutely right that the Government steps in to defend free speech. Without the ability to speak freely soon we will not have the ability to think freely,” Sir John said.UK Schools Told to Teach ‘Cancel Culture’ Is Harmful, Not to Promote ‘Victim Narratives’ https://t.co/eVDVXusWqJ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 27, 2020Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden alongside Heritage Minister Nigel Huddleson will also host a Whitehall roundtable with the heads of the National Trust, Historic England, and other heritage bodies to reinforce the message that “public funds must never be used for political purposes” and to refrain from attempts to “airbrush” British history.In the letter, Mr Dowden said: “Proud and confident nations face their past squarely; they do not seek to run from or airbrush the history upon which they are founded.“History is ridden with moral complexity and interpreting Britain’s past should not be an excuse to tell an overly-simplistic version of our national story, in which we damn the faults of previous generations whilst forgetting their many great achievements. Purging uncomfortable elements of our past does nothing but damage our understanding of it.”The move comes after Historic England released a hit list ‘audit‘ of villages, churches, pubs, schools, farms, and village halls deemed to have benefited from the transatlantic slave trade.In response, Mr Dowden has ordered that civil servants work with Historic England in order to enforce the government’s message of “retrain and explain” rather than launch attacks.A spokesman for Historic England said: “We have been working on the subject of contested heritage for some time – we believe that removing difficult or contentious parts of the historic environment damages our understanding of our collective past.”Churchill College Hosts Anti-Churchill Talk: 'Embodiment of White Supremacy', British Empire 'Far Worse' Than Nazis https://t.co/a6eTjrqL4u— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 14, 2021The National Trust, which has been shifting leftward for years, has also embarked on a campaign of BLM-style iconoclasm.In September, the charity published the taxpayer-funded Colonial Countryside project, which targetted 93 National Trust properties, including the home of British wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill, for their alleged ties to colonialism and slavery.The Colonial Countryside project recently came under fire after it was revealed staff at the Trust were being “reverse mentored” by “child advisory boards” that instructed them in the alleged evils of the British Empire.The government has also tasked the newly installed head of Britain’s broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, to ensure that news networks abide by “due impartiality” rules after MPs accused the likes of the BBC and Channel 4 of trying to “appeal to a narrow band of north London metropolitan virtue signalling politically correct lefties”.""What statues do is point us to a place in our collective history, they form part of a wider conversation.

910,"A 32-year-old pro-migration activist has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after being found guilty of attacking police at a Paris protest.The attack took place at a demonstration on the 28th of November, with video played in court showing the accused kicking one officer and later beating other officers at the Place de la Bastille.Investigators later identified the man, finding him in a disused gendarmerie barracks where he lived with several other people linked to the environmental movement, Le Monde reports.The 32-year-old had volunteered for a pro-migration association.

Branco, meanwhile, stated that his client would not be launching an appeal against the judgment.Paris police arrested 81 people following the November demonstrations held to protest the “global security” law, which would have criminalised filming police.Across the country, an estimated 500,000 people took to the streets in protest of the law, resulting in clashes between far-left extremists and police in several areas, leading to 61 officers being injured, 23 of them in Paris.President Emmanuel Macron’s government later backtracked on the controversial law, with Interior Minister Christophe Castaner saying the bill would be completely rewritten.Far-left attacks on police have become common at major demonstrations and riots.

912,"Police forces in Britain have recorded some 120,000 allegations of so-called hate speech, though none of the instances had been found to have stopped any actual crimes.In the United Kingdom, the police record non-crime hate incidents in criminal databases, meaning that despite having committed no crime, people will have the incidents visible on criminal background checks for six years. There is currently no appeal system in place.A freedom of information request from the Mail on Sunday revealed that none of the 43 police forces in England and Wales could list a single crime that was prevented by the crackdown on free speech.Twenty of the forces went on to admit that they do not have any system in place to monitor the effectiveness of the draconian practice.The hate crime adviser for the National Police Chiefs’ Council, Paul Gianassi, defended the recording of non-hate crime incidents, claiming that instances of hate speech could lead to “dehumanisation and ultimately murder”.Senior officers have also claimed that it assists the police in measuring “tensions effectively and to prevent serious hostility and violence”.A former police officer, Harry Miller, who was investigated by police in Humberside after sharing allegedly “transphobic” tweets online, said: “Non-crime hate incident reports do not appear to have any usefulness as a crime prevention tool, but what they do have is a chilling effect on free speech because they make people think twice before saying or posting something on social media in the fear that it could land them with a criminal record.“These reports have allowed the police to become weaponised by woke activists who seek to attack and shut people up if they dare to express any views that they do not agree with.”‘Dislike’ and ‘Unfriendliness’ Can Be Hate Crimes, UK Police Confirm https://t.co/UMwDGHW2YM— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 25, 2017The UK Hate Crime Operational Guidelines state that non-crime hate incidents “must be recorded regardless of whether or not they are the victim, and irrespective of whether there is any evidence to identify the hate element”.The guidelines on supposed hate incidents were recently updated to apply to schoolchildren and extended to instances of “ill-will, spite, contempt, prejudice, unfriendliness, antagonism, resentment and dislike”.In their attempts to tackle “hate” on the internet, police have also called upon the public to snitch on their fellow citizens for “things like offensive or insulting comments, online, in person or in writing”.The chairman of the Common Sense Group of MPs and peers, Sir John Hayes, warned that the restrictions on speech are undermining the fundamental rights of Britons.“There is a real threat in our society of the development of a thought police where only certain views are permitted and all else is at best regarded as unacceptable and at worst is deemed illegal.“We must not meander into an Orwellian world where certain views are proscribed by an unrepresented and zealous minority who are determined to eradicate any views that are not compatible with their own.

914,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage has criticised Health Secretary Matt Hancock for being “drunk on his own power” after introducing a law making it a criminal offence to lie about having travelled from a coronavirus ‘red list’ nation, which could result in ten years in prison.The health secretary announced the new measures on Tuesday, putting the potential sentence on a par with prison terms handed out for serious crimes such as poisoning or making threats to kill.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage reacted to the remarkable development in Britain’s coronavirus strategy, saying: “The Coronavirus Act allows ministers to take the most draconian decisions without due process or a vote in parliament. It is a threat to civil liberties.”10 years in prison for going on holiday? The government has gone too far this time.Power without accountability. pic.twitter.com/rp4dh48OHr— Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 10, 2021Mr Farage reminded Britons during a YouTube broadcast on Wednesday that he had warned the government was “taking far too much power” and eroding Britons’ liberties for several months, but that “all of this went a step too far” following Hancock’s “diktat”, saying the health minister had become “completely drunk on his own power”.“We are fast becoming a police state,” Mr Farage later remarked.Former Supreme Court Justice Jonathan Sumption had also warned that government ministers’ ability to force through new measures and police expanded powers to enforce it made Britain increasingly look like a “police state”.Farage further criticised the government’s hypocritical approach to border control, where that while last year “they couldn’t care less about our borders” and allowed 18 million people to arrived unchecked in the three months up to the first lockdown, Britons are now ordered to quarantine in hotels for ten days if they have come from any of the dozens of “red list” nations at a cost of £1,750 per person for accommodation, travel, and testing.Minister Says UK Govt Discussing ‘Internationally Recognised’ Corona Passport for Global Travel https://t.co/CARmcCK7aa— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 11, 2021He also remarked on the complete lack of parity in treatment between legal arrivals — threatened with costly hotel confinement or arrest — and illegal aliens who continue to arrive across the English Channel to be put up at taxpayers’ expense.“There is one exception to all of this: if you come into the UK illegally by dinghy across the English Channel on the next calm day, the fact that you’ve got no documentation, the fact you’ve not had a PCR coronavirus test in the previous three days, none of that will matter. You will still get put into a hotel. The difference is: nobody will charge you £1,700 for the privilege.“If ever there was a moment to start dealing with illegal immigration, surely it’s now. If we’re going to get tough with our borders, is this not the moment to say, ‘We will not accept people coming criminally into the United Kingdom and posing a massive coronavirus risk’?” he said.The Reform UK leader also said that while he could understand the government providing documentary proof of vaccination so that Britons could use it to enter foreign countries demanding it, “what I don’t want, is for us to finish up with people in the street being stopped asked to produce their papers to prove they’ve been vaccinated. With this government as out of control as it is as we’ve seen in the last 24 hours, I think any of these things are possible.”“This is about our liberties. This is about our freedoms. The more power central government takes, the more difficult it is to get those freedoms back,” he warned.Delingpole: Ten Years’ Jail for Lying About Your Holiday?

916,"Senior Conservative MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith has condemned as police going mad with “unlimited power”, after reports that a police officer told two young children playing in a park to go home and play in their gardens, even though they lived in an apartment.Media reported this week that a police officer approached brothers Wren, eight, and six-year-old Bo late last month as they were taking pictures of their freshly-made snowman in a London park, telling the youngsters to go home and play there.Campaign group Play Outside said that this was an oft-repeated scenario, exasperated by the guidelines in England that said that while adults may meet in pairs for exercise, children must not play with each other if they are not part of their family, reported the i newspaper.Brexiteer and member of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) Steve Baker condemned the overzealous police officer, saying: “This unabashed vehemence in the expression of state power beyond the limits of the law would be comical if it were not for real. As the government succeeds in vaccinating vulnerable, incidents like this only underscore the need to reclaim our lives once and for all.”The government said that while children may play in playgrounds, they are not allowed to socialise, a statement they were forced to make after the Cabinet Office appeared to imply that only children without places to play at home were allowed to use parks.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former Conservative leader, responds to the story two children were sent home from a playground by officials for breaching Covid laws: ""This is what happens to people when they are given almost unlimited power."" @JuliaHB1 | @MPIainDS pic.twitter.com/IVUAZb2wo0— talkRADIO (@talkRADIO) February 11, 2021“Playgrounds are primarily for use by children who do not have access to private outdoor space, and while parents, guardians or carers are allowed to take children to a playground for exercise, they must not socialise with other people while there,” the Cabinet Office, the department responsible for supporting the prime minister and his Cabinet, had said.Speaking to talkRADIO’s Julia Hartley-Brewer on Thursday, Sir Iain, a former leader of the Conservative Party, said that the incident displayed the consequence of “what happens to people when they are given almost unlimited power”.Quoting the Cabinet Office, Ms Hartley-Brewer asked if “psychopathic” was not too harsh of a term to describe the statement, Duncan Smith replied: “No, but what it does describe is what happens to people when they are given almost unlimited power.“Their mentality goes in the same direction, which is, ‘What I say is right, therefore it must be obeyed.’ Nobody thinks for a second: ‘Does meet the normal standards of what people might do”.”“I generally would be concerned about that because it’s mad.

918,"A new law proposed by the far-left party in Spain’s coalition government will make it easier for residents to change genders for official purposes. A bill sponsored by Equality Minister Irene Montero aims to make gender self-determination — no diagnosis, medical treatment or judge required — the norm, with eligibility starting at age 16. Nearly 20 countries, eight of them in the European Union, already have similar laws.Factions of the Catholic Church and the right have focused their opposition to the bill on the fact that it also would allow children under 16 to bypass parental objections and seek a judge’s assistance in accessing treatment for gender dysphoria, the medical term for the psychological distress that results from a conflict between an individual’s identity and birth-assigned sex.Less expected has been the fierce resistance from some feminists and from within Spain’s Socialist-led government.“I’m fundamentally worried by the idea that if gender can be chosen with no more than one’s will or desire, that could put at risk the identity criteria for 47 million Spaniards,” Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, a veteran Socialist and women’s rights advocate, said last week.Opponents argue that allowing people to choose their gender eventually would lead to “erasing” women from the public sphere: if more Spaniards registered male at birth switch to female, they say, it would skew national statistics and create more competition for women for everything from jobs to sports trophies.A transgender weightlifter has swept the women’s categories in the 2019 Pacific Games in Samoa, winning two gold medals over natural-born female opponents. https://t.co/SfRxKoo84U— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) July 16, 2019The divide in Spain mirrors a debate between a branch of feminist theorists and LGBTQ rights movements around the globe. At one end, activists often derogatorily referred to as TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists) posit that accepting transgender orthodoxy uncritically could undercut efforts to root out sexism and misogyny by negating the existence of biological sexes.The State Federation of Lesbian, Gay, Transgender and Bisexual people says that if passed in its current form, the law would help end discrimination against transgender people and leapfrog Spain to the European vanguard of advancing LGBTQ political causes.Montero’s bill nonetheless has provoked unusual fury on online platforms, where critics express alarm over provisions that would assign public toilets and prisons according to “registered gender.” Confluencia Feminista, an alliance of dozens of women’s rights organizations, also has come out against any changes to Spain’s existing law.Former Prisons Minister Reveals Trans Inmates Have Raped Female Staff https://t.co/bhhwypOwzY— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 14, 2020The concern of Alexandra Paniagua, one of the new platform’s activists, pivots around the idea that by eliminating the opinions of doctors and judges, state-subsidized hormones and gender reassignment surgery would become more available, ultimately “promoting” more dysphoria among young people.“More people will see easier access to the invasive treatment, especially girls who have been told that their bodies are less worthy in our society,” she said.But Trans Platform Federation President Mar Cambrollé argues that some of the fears cited as reasons to keep existing hurdles in place are based on outdated ideas that reduce boys and girls, men and women to a handful of socially prescribed characteristics and roles.“Transphobic attitudes piss me off,” Cambrollé said. “As a woman, I’ve been discriminated against for being a woman in a world made by men for men, but also by cis[gender] people who build it with other cis people in mind.”No Prison for Trans 'Woman' Who Attacked Underage Girls in Public Toilets https://t.co/ijHakEPan9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 17, 2019Finding a compromise any time soon looks like an insurmountable task judging by the virulence of the debate online.

919,"The Guardian has amended an article decrying the “phallic” necktie as a symbol of “white male power” to correct an erroneous assertion that it is based on the codpiece.The article by Professor Claire Robinson, pro-vice-chancellor of the College of Creative Arts at Massey University, focuses on her anger that the New Zealand parliament is opting to retain rules making ties mandatory for male members — “a dress standard designed to promulgate Victorian white male power” — but raised eyebrows by claiming that “For those unfamiliar, the necktie is derived from the codpiece, a fabric flap or pouch designed 500 years ago to emphasise a European nobleman’s importance through his large phallic size.”“Today, the necktie retains its connection with the codpiece through its arrow shaped design and length that directs the eye of an onlooker down towards a man’s groin,” Robinson added.Many readers questioned whether this assertion had any basis in reality — and the Guardian now appears to have concluded that it did not, having amended the original version of the article to say that the tie merely “echoes the shape of the codpiece”.“This article was amended on 10 February 2021 to clarify the writer’s position that the necktie echoes the shape of the codpiece rather than it being derived from it,” an editor’s note now concedes at the bottom of the article’s current incarnation.Gaah.

920,"LONDON (AP) – The British economy suffered its biggest decline in more than 300 years in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic closed shops and restaurants, devastated the travel industry and curtailed manufacturing.The economy shrank 9.9% last year, more than twice the figure for 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. The drop is the largest since 1709, when a cold spell known as the Great Frost devastated what was then a largely agricultural economy.The data comes as Britain´s economy remains shackled by restrictions designed to combat COVID-19. A rebound in growth during the fourth quarter has been stifled by England´s third lockdown, which has closed schools, restaurants and non-essential shops since mid-December. Tough restrictions also remain in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.“Today´s figures show that the economy has experienced a serious shock as a result of the pandemic, which has been felt by countries around the world,” the U.K.´s top treasury official, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said in a statement. “While there are some positive signs of the economy´s resilience over the winter, we know that the current lockdown continues to have a significant impact on many people and businesses.”Sunak said he would announce new plans to protect jobs and bolster the economy when he delivers his annual budget statement to the House of Commons on March 3.COVID-19 has hit Britain´s economy harder than most other industrialized democracies. French GDP shrank 8.3% last year, Germany 5% and the U.S. 3.5%.The GDP figures show the breadth of the pandemic´s economic impact in Britain.The service sector, which accounts for about 80% of the U.K. economy, shrank 8.9% last year, with output from accommodation, food and beverage businesses down more than 55% from February levels. Manufacturing fell 8.6% and construction 12.5%.In hopes of relaxing the restrictions that have devastated the economy, the U.K. has moved to rapidly vaccinate its most vulnerable residents. More than 13.5 million people, or about 20% of the population, had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine by Wednesday.Andy Haldane, chief economist for the Bank of England, said the vaccination drive is helping Britain turn a corner in its battle against the virus. Lifting COVID-19 restrictions is likely to unleash a wave of spending by consumers and businesses that will trigger a rapid recovery later this year, he said.“A decisive corner is about to be turned for the economy, too, with enormous amounts of pent-up financial energy waiting to be released, like a coiled spring,” Haldane wrote in the Daily Mail.But that optimism comes against the backdrop of Europe´s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 115,000 deaths recorded so far.“These figures confirm that not only has the U.K. had the worst death toll in Europe, we´re experiencing the worst economic crisis of any major economy,” said Anneliese Dodds, the opposition Labour Party´s spokesperson on economic issues. “Businesses can´t wait any longer. The Chancellor needs to come forward now with a plan to secure the economy in the months ahead, with support going hand-in-hand with health restrictions.”EconomyLondon / EuropeBank of EnglandcoronavirusRishi SunakUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
921,"Social distancing measures and mask-wearing could be enforced until the end of the year, despite Britain’s world-leading coronavirus vaccine progress.Government sources have indicated that ministers are considering extending the period of restrictions in order to move England out of the third lockdown.Some form of lockdown, restrictions, or social distancing measures have been in place since March 2020.“The thinking is that social distancing will need to be in place for a long time to come,” a Whitehall source told The Times on Friday. “It has repercussions for the scale of any reopening. Restaurants, pubs, and offices will all need to be Covid-secure.”“The more restrictions we have in place, like social distancing rules, the more we can do in terms of easing,” a government source also told the newspaper of record.Sources have told the newspaper that several levels of restrictions are currently being discussed.Britons have already been subject to various social distancing measures, ranging from limiting social gatherings, imposing social distancing of two metres (six feet) between people in public spaces, and dictating how many times a day a person may leave their house.Delingpole: Britain Is Now a Tyranny.

This week, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warning people not to book summer holidays, yet — not even within the UK, suggesting that restrictions could still be in place domestically in six months’ time.Public Health England also said on Friday that some restrictions could be in place until all adults in the United Kingdom have been vaccinated, or even beyond that.Some 15 million people considered to be the most vulnerable are expected to be vaccinated by mid-February. As of Wednesday, the UK had given vaccine doses to more people than in the entire 27 countries of the European Union combined, putting the British government on course to meet its first vaccine targets.Boris Johnson’s administration was forced to recommit to February 22nd as the date on which the prime minister would set out the roadmap for taking the country out of lockdown.Earlier this week, the prime minister’s office appeared to “backslide” from that date.

The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
923,"Communist China’s state broadcasting regulator has pulled Britain’s BBC World News from its airwaves for alleged content violation, including on impartiality and undermining the repressive regime’s ‘ethnic solidarity’.Chinese state-owned English language news channel CGTN reported on Thursday that the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) claimed BBC World News, the international television news network operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation, was alleged to have violated broadcasting regulations related to impartiality.CGTN also claimed that the British broadcaster had been found to have “undermined China’s national interests and ethnic solidarity”.NRTA said in a statement: “As the channel fails to meet the requirements to broadcast in China as an overseas channel, BBC World News is not allowed to continue its service within Chinese territory. The NRTA will not accept the channel’s broadcast application for the new year.”The move appears to have happened effective immediately, with two Reuters journalists based in China saying that the channel had gone blank, as China ushered in the Lunar New Year.The move may be a tit-for-tat reprisal, after Britain’s communications regulator Ofcom revoked CGTN’s licence to broadcast in the United Kingdom last week because of its possible links to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The broadcasting watchdog is also continuing to investigate complaints that CGTN aired alleged forced confessions, including from a British Consulate employee in Hong Kong.Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin threatened last week that the CCP “reserves the right to take action in response”.China Threatens Revenge After UK Bans Communist Propaganda Outlet https://t.co/qqrZ6TYhvx— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021The BBC came into conflict with the communist state over its widespread oppression of the Uighurs in Xinjiang. Last year the broadcaster’s Andrew Marr grilled China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, on drone footage showing members of the Muslim minority group, heads shaven, being forced onto trains.Marr confronted the diplomat with a comparison to oppression under Nazism, saying: “When we see interviews like that, and we say people blindfolded and led off to trains to be taken to re-education camps, it reminds people in the West [of] what was going on in Germany in the 1930s.”Xiaoming claimed in response that “there’s no such concentration camp in Xinjiang”, implying that the footage, which Marr said had been authenticated by Western intelligence agencies, was fake news.The ambassador also rejected testimony he was shown of Uighur women revealing that the state forcibly sterilising them.Over a dozen British universities are reportedly under investigation by security services over their relationships with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which may have violated national security and human rights laws.  https://t.co/JPASmB4Fvn— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021More recently, Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other minorities who had survived the communist-run concentration camps told the BBC that women had been gang-raped and tortured, sometimes sexually assaulted with electric batons, electrocuting the women from the inside.Global Times, the Chinese Communist Party’s most belligerent propaganda mouthpiece, claimed that authorities have labelled the BBC a “rumour mill”, writing that “the decision to suspend its broadcast sends a clear message that China doesn’t accept fake news”.The news outlet drew attention to the BBC’s coverage of the Xinjiang concentration camps — which Global Times labelled “re-education camps” — labelling it a “sensational story”, alleging also that the “broadcaster also distorted coronavirus reports about Wuhan”.An estimated two million people are imprisoned in Xinjiang’s concentration camp system, the number having fallen from around three million after reports the regime sold some prisoners into slave labour.UK Paid £150m to Chinese Concentration Camp Connected Companies for Covid PPE https://t.co/rqZFmtBqGZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 10, 2021London / EuropeMediaNational SecurityBBCCGTNChinaChinese Communist PartynewsUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
924,"A London psychiatrist has said he is not under any doubt that the coronavirus lockdown has led to a surge in mental health referrals for children, saying the figure had “skyrocketed”.Dr Omer Moghraby described seeing a rise in children who have cut themselves or taken overdoses in Accident and Emergency wards. He has seen other children suffering from eating disorders, losing such a drastic amount of weight that doctors are fighting to save their lives.“The closure of schools, the lack of contact with friends and stopping all sports activities is having a particularly damaging effect on children.“One can only say the major factor across it all is pandemic — the lack of activities, the lack of schooling, the lack of opportunities for these young people and probably a deterioration of wellbeing of their parents not being able to cope,” the child psychiatrist told Sky News on Thursday.Dr Moghraby is not the only healthcare professional in recent weeks to voice his concern about the rising healthcare crisis amongst the young.At the beginning of February, Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary wrote for the BBC that before the pandemic, he and his colleagues would see children experiencing a mental health crisis arrive at A&E once or twice a week, but since the lockdown had become a more frequent occurrence. Self-harm, more commonly seen in teenagers, is starting to be observed in younger and younger children, too, he said.“Since the summer it’s been more like once or twice a day. Some as young as 10 have cut themselves, taken overdoses, or tried to asphyxiate themselves. There was even one child aged eight,” Dr Wright wrote.The doctor reported that other physicians from every corner of the United Kingdom had noted a similar phenomenon.Top Tory: Authorities Going Mad with ‘Unlimited Power’ After Children Ordered from Play Park https://t.co/CdJcsj6iM3— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 12, 2021Experts had warned after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the third lockdown that “the pandemic has created a mental health ticking time bomb” in young people, who are finding themselves under lockdown for such a long period of their young lives.Child behaviour specialist Elizabeth O’Shea continued that “the biggest issue is the mental health impact, I think what we know in the parenting industry is that we are going to be experiencing three main problems: depression, anxiety and OCD, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.”Ms O’Shea added that it was “vital” for children to play and get exercise outside. However, campaign group Play Outside has said that unclear lockdown rules have resulted in police ordering children not to play with each other at parks or ordered to leave.The issue was highlighted this week when two brothers, aged eight and six, were allegedly commanded by London police to leave the park because they were in breach of lockdown and told to play in their own garden, despite not having one because they lived in an apartment.Amid Rise in Child Self-Harm, Suicidality, Alcohol Deaths Boris Appoints ‘Mental Health Ambassador’ https://t.co/YKKQzx86sf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 4, 2021In November 2020, it was reported that the number of people having suicidal thoughts had tripled during lockdown, with a similar increase in people seeking help for anxiety or who have self-harmed.Eating disorders had also risen by nearly one-third, while six-in-ten psychiatrists said they had seen an increase in emergency callouts for people in mental health crises. Physicians also saw a rise in people needing to be sectioned or otherwise requiring a bed at a mental health facility.Last month, it was revealed that NHS general practitioners had been told to “stand down” routine care for their patients, to prioritise vaccinations, which charities warned could negatively impact Britons’ relationship with their GPs.Stillbirths Nearly Double During UK’s First Lockdown https://t.co/c625tKd6mj— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 3, 2020HealthLondon / EuropeScienceChildrencoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownmental healthsocial distancingUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
925,"Healthy young illegal immigrants have been given preferential treatment in receiving the coronavirus vaccines ahead of elderly and vulnerable native Britons, an investigation has found.Migrants who came to the United Kingdom illegally and are now being housed at the taxpayers’ expense at the four-star Crowne Plaza Hotel in London have received free coronavirus vaccinations, the Daily Mail reported on Saturday.One illegal Sudanese migrant, 20-year-old Abdul, who crossed in a boat from the safe and wealthy France seven months ago, told the newspaper: “I was given the vaccination yesterday at the hotel to stop me catching Covid. There are 400 migrants living here and we nearly all had it. No-one I know refused.”A group of Sudanese and Eritrean migrants said that on Thursday a “mass vaccination” operation was held at the hotel.A 27-year-old Sudanese national said: “The vaccinations were given to us whatever our age.”“We didn’t have to pay. We were told to queue up for them at the hotel. None of us want to catch the coronavirus,” he said.“This was the first vaccination and I don’t know which company made it. We will have another one nearer the summertime,” the migrant added.The illegal migrants at the hotel are also not being subjected to the strict measures placed on people arriving in the country legitimately from a so-called ‘red list’ of 33 countries, who are required to quarantine themselves in inferior hotels at their own expense with heavy fines for those who break the rules.The government has also announced that people who lie about their travel history could face up to ten years in prison.The migrants, meanwhile, are free to roam into nearby West Drayton to shop for food and so on despite the lockdown.‘Coming to a Hotel Near You?’ – Farage Releases Video of Migrants Being Loaded on Coaches at Dover https://t.co/hixd3s9aRk— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 6, 2020As a result of the Chinese coronavirus crisis taking place alongside record-breaking waves of illegal boat migration, the Home Office has been housing migrants in hotels across the country.Prior to the government commandeering the Crowne Plaza as a migrant hotel, it served as a popular destination for business people travelling in London due to its proximity to Heathrow Airport, with suites going for upwards of £100 per night.Several migrants still complained about the quality of the free food provided to them at the taxpayers’ expense in the hotel, however, with one saying: “I was living rough in Calais until before Christmas when I came to the UK by boat. When I was given this hotel to stay in I was relieved.”“They serve us too much rice and pasta to eat. It is nearly every meal apart from breakfast. That is the biggest complaint we have.”Complaints about “culturally inappropriate” food were raised as a possible contributing factor to hotel migrant going on a stabbing spree in Glasgow in 2020.""[T]hey were fed three times a day but people were complaining at getting the same spaghetti and macaroni cheese all the time.

926,"14 people have been arrested across Denmark and Germany as police break up a suspected Islamic State-loyal terror cell in the process of acquiring bomb-making materials and firearms.Press Conference takes place — Breitbart London update, Friday 1155:Speaking at a press conference on Friday morning, Danish counter-terror chief Lene Sørensen said the plot intercepted by officers in recent days is suspected to have radical Islamist inspiration.A report of the comments in Denmark’s oldest newspaper Berlingske notes Sørensen said she couldn’t be sure exactly where the terror cell was planning to strike, but that it was likely inside Denmark or Germany.Her colleague Flemming Drejer said an Islamic State flag was found during police raids, and that; “We have found the ingredients needed to make a bomb. We have also found weapons such as pump [action shotguns] and a hunting rifle with binoculars. These are some findings that concern us.”The security officers said there was no imminent danger to the public.Read the Associated Press newswire on this story below: COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) – The number of people arrested in Denmark and Germany over an alleged terror attack plot rose to 14 on Friday with six more people placed in pre-trial detention.All but one of the suspects were arrested in Denmark. Three of them were Syrian nationals, aged 33, 36 and 40, who were arrested last weekend.Authorities in Germany and Denmark initially on Thursday announced eight arrests, and on Friday, another six people were held, police said.All the detention hearings in Denmark were held behind so-called double closed doors, meaning the case is shrouded in secrecy and few details are made public. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service is planning a news conference later in the day.The agency, known by its Danish acronym PET, said Thursday that the people arrested in Denmark were suspected “of having acquired ingredients and components for the manufacture of explosives, as well as weapons, or having participated in this.”The persons’ identities and other nationalities were not made public.Earlier, German authorities had announced the first three arrests – two in Denmark and one in Germany. They said the suspects were alleged to have purchased several kilograms (pounds) of chemicals in January that could be used to manufacture explosives.A search of a residence in the city of Dessau-Rosslau, between Naumburg and Berlin, turned up 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of black powder, and fuses, the German prosecutor said. More chemicals were seized in Denmark.PET said those arrested in Denmark are suspected of “having planned one or more terrorist attacks or participated in attempted terrorism.” It did not say where such an attack would take place.Law and OrderLondon / EuropebombDenmarkEuropean UnionGermanyterrorism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
927,"‘There are loads of people who think it isn’t worth going on at the moment. And it’s about time some bloody Secretaries of State understood this! Existing isn’t living for many people!’Congratulations to Sir Charles Walker MP, for telling it like it is on BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme. I’ve rarely heard a politician so righteously angry on that programme, nor yet one who has used a swear word.And bloody right of him too! Walker may be the last truly decent politician in Britain – the only one prepared fully to acknowledge the scale of the devastation and cruelties being inflicted on the British people by an increasingly dangerous and out of control government.Walker was responding, in particular, to two egregious statements by government ministers. First, he objected to the one by Health Secretary Matt Hancock exulting in the 10-year prison sentence which will henceforward to apply to anyone who has been on holiday to Portugal (or any other country on the government’s Red List) and lies about it. Second, he objected to one by the equally noisome and low-grade Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warning people not to book summer holidays, even in Britain..Shapps told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:On the shrinking chance that there is anybody listening to this interview at this stage, and thinking of booking a holiday under the current circumstances … please don’t go ahead and book holidays for something which, at this stage, is illegal to actually go and do, whether it’s here or abroad.Walker was properly incensed by this. As he told the BBC interviewer Sarah Montague:The goal posts have not so much been moved as ripped off and carried to another playing field. This is just not acceptable. This is becoming an extended exercise in almost studied and deliberate cruelty for a nation that is increasingly anxious and under pressure.People need to see their children. They need to see their parents. They need to see the people that they love. They need to have something to look forward to.We are conducting a massive experiment in creating high levels of anxiety.Montague pointed out that opinion polls appeared to show most people in favour of lockdown.Walker replied:I suspect most people are in favour of lockdown as long as it works for them. And that when they do breach it they breach it in a ‘responsible’ way. ‘I’m a very responsible person’, they’ll say. ‘It’s those ruffians down the road that need lockdown.’So don’t read too much into opinion polls.Walker then moved onto the subject of vaccines which, he noted, had once been touted by the government as the event that would set everyone free.We were told that when the vaccine came release would happen. And it now seems that the government either knows something it’s not willing to share with us about vaccines or is just really facing in multiple directions and is determined to muddy the water and sow confusion…Montague, in characteristic BBC style, tried to trip him up on his suggestion that the government might know something about vaccines that it wanted to keep secret.Walker wasn’t playing her game:For crying out loud, we were told, weren’t we, that the vaccines were the route out of this? We had summer holidays last year when we didn’t have the vaccine.Again, Montague tried to trip him up by making it about him.She asked: ‘Have you booked a summer holiday?’Walker refused to engage with such frivolousness.Now we’ve got vaccines coming out of our ears we’re told not to book a summer holiday, for crying out loud. It does strike me as odd – and if it doesn’t strike you as odd we’re in a completely different place on this!Montague tried again:Have you booked a holiday?Walker:It’s not about me. It’s about stressed-out people who need something to look forward to. Yeah? Mental health is important. Loads of anxious people. Loads of them writing to me. OK?Walker, you could hear, was on the verge of losing his rag completely. (That aggressive ‘Yeah?’ and ‘OK?’ could have left no listener in doubt just how irritated he was, not least with Montague’s loyal upholding of the government’s propaganda narrative).If it hadn’t been for coronavirus, Walker would probably have remained one of those backbench MPs that no one has ever heard of. Looking at his biography, about the most interesting things about him are that he suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder, that he has twice won the Spectator‘s prize parliamentary speech of the year, and that he was once tipped to replace the poison dwarf John Bercow as Speaker of the House.But the current crisis has been the making of him. His first moment of glory came when he intervened after witnessing police manhandling an elderly woman who was protesting against coronavirus restrictions.He called the officers’ actions an ‘absolute disgrace.’Walker, I suspect, is the classic example of a complacent conservative mugged by reality – and transformed into a campaigning radical.Sure, other MPs have on occasion raised questions about the government’s increasingly unhinged and draconian coronavirus policies. But none has done so with the passion and commitment of Charles Walker. He has understood — as his parliamentary colleagues have inexcusably failed to do — that this is not just another game of positioning, and that Britain has slipped inexorably into tyranny with barely a whimper of resistance from its craven, career-safe MPs. Britain’s democracy is broken and only one MP has really noticed. How disgraceful and depressing is that?Charles Walker is fast becoming my favourite MP. pic.twitter.com/hCbH8CdiX3— Darren Grimes (@darrengrimes_) February 11, 2021London / EuropeBBCCharles Walker MPcoronavirusfascismGrant ShappsMatt HancockSarah MontaguetyrannyUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
928,"The Member of Parliament for Rotherham has revealed that she knows survivors of mostly-Muslim rape gangs who are now 70-years-old, suggesting the scope of the abuse is far vaster than many suspected.Sarah Champion MP was sacked from the opposition Labour’s front bench by former leader Jeremy Corbyn after writing that “Britain has a problem with British Pakistani men raping and exploiting white girls” in 2017. Much like police officers and council workers in the city, who like the authorities in other areas had long failed to tackle the issue due to fears they would be branded racist for intervening, the left-wing party found the issue too sensitive to confront head-on.Champion was not brought back into the party leadership by Corbyn’s supposedly moderate successor, Sir Keir Starmer — who instead made Naz Shah, who once shared a tweet saying “abused girls in Rotherham and elsewhere just need to shut their mouths. For the good of diversity”, his Shadow Minister for Community Cohesion” — but has continued to speak out on rape gangs, despite requiring enhanced police security as a result.“I fail to understand why this topic is so emotive, when there is a clear picture of gangs with a similar profile being involved in sexual abuse and exploitation,” she wrote in the Yorkshire Post recently, against the backdrop of another victim having recently come forward to say West Midlands Police have charged none of the 18 men she named after around eight years, and lost dozens of hours of her interview tapes.Sarah Champion MP Under Threat After Calling Out Pakistani Grooming Gangs, But Vows ‘I’m Not Done’ https://t.co/jfAFcqIC0u— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 13, 2018“We are very fortunate in Rotherham, because the National Crime Agency’s Operation Stovewood is looking at cases of CSE [Child Sexual Exploitation] by grooming gangs between 1997 and 2013, a 16-year period,” said Champion, referring to one of several belated initiatives to try and bring some rape gang members previously overlooked by the authorities to justice.“It has already identified 1,569 survivors and 261 designated suspects.“To date we have had 20 convictions in court, and four awaiting trial.“That is in 16 years. I know survivors who are 70 years old,” she said, strongly implying that such gang-based child abuse had been going on for decades longer than generally supposed.“Think about the scale and length of time of this abuse.”Indeed, while some infamous rape gang members such as Shahzad ‘Keith’ Khan preyed on women in a Telford residence known as ‘The Rape House’ from 1981 — without ever being punished for it — Champion’s revelations about victims who are now as old as 70 pushes the timeline of the abuse back almost to the beginning of the mass migration era in Britain.Sarah Champion MP Under Threat After Calling Out Pakistani Grooming Gangs, But Vows ‘I’m Not Done’ https://t.co/jfAFcqIC0u— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 13, 2018CrimeImmigrationLondon / EuropeBritainBritish policechild abusechild sexual exploitationCSEdiversityEmpire Windrushgrooming gangslabourLabour PartyMass MigrationMigrantsMulticulturalismPaedophilespaedophiliapedophilespedophiliapolitical correctnessRaperape gangsRochdaleRotherhamSarah ChampionTelfordUnited KingdomWest Midlands PoliceWindrush GenerationWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

930,"The government of Ukraine issued a decree this week banning the distribution of Sputnik V, a Russian coronavirus vaccine candidate President Vladimir Putin hastily approved last year, Reuters reported Wednesday, after warning the product was a “hybrid weapon” against the country.The administration of President Volodymyr Zelensky has escalated its measures to diminish the influence of Russian propaganda operations in the country, most recently shutting down a media network owned by a close ally of Putin’s, given the greater context of a protracted invasion and war by Russian separatists in the nation’s east. Russia also invaded and annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014; it remains under Russian control today.Zelensky arrived in the eastern Donetsk region of the country on Thursday, on a visit to assess the on-the-ground condition in the war there. Separatist groups in the greater Donbass region, where a war has been ongoing since 2014, claim to have established sovereign “republics” in the Ukrainian territory. Kyiv regularly accuses the separatists of cooperating with Russia, though Russia keeps a distance publicly from those fighting the Ukrainian military on the ground.The official Ukrainian government decree published this week formally prohibited the nation’s public health and drug regulatory authorities from approving any vaccine created “in a state recognized by the Ukrainian parliament as a state aggressor,” a list that only includes Russia, as it is the only country currently involved in hostilities with Ukraine.Ukraine is a member of the Covax program, run by the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), which is designed to help poorer nations access coronavirus vaccine doses. Sputnik V is not yet part of the Covax portfolio — the Russian government has claimed that it prefers to sign vaccine deals with nations directly rather than through the W.H.O. intermediary, but has left room for a potential deal to offer doses of Sputnik V through the program.“We will be working with COVAX, but definitely we will not be substituting COVAX for the approach we’ve been using till now to basically supply vaccines to countries directly,” Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev said in January.Ukraine is an active participant in Covax, which allows for the potential of a shipment of Sputnik V in the future if the government did not explicitly prevent its importing.Banning the Chinese coronavirus product this week followed incendiary remarks by the Ukrainian foreign ministry accusing Russia of using the vaccine as a “weapon” to promote its geopolitical interests.“There’s another hybrid dimension in this story, the situation with the Russian vaccine. We understand that when it comes to the Russian vaccine, it’s a hybrid weapon of Russia against Ukraine,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kulebo said in a televised interview in December. The remark indicates that Ukrainian officials are more concerned about Russia’s political interests regarding the vaccine than its efficacy, which has raised eyebrows around the world.President Vladimir Putin approved Sputik V in August 2020, making it the first coronavirus candidate approved for distribution by a state power in history. The Russian government did not indicate that public health officials deemed it safe and effective — Putin overrode his own Health Ministry — and admitted at the time that the product had not completed Phase III clinical trials. Putin assured Russians it was a safe product by claiming his daughter had received a dose, but never clarified which of his two daughters had done so.Given the lack of testing, international health experts warned that many questions about its ability to combat the virus safely remained unanswered. Russia nonetheless began selling the vaccine candidate to allied countries. A study in the Lancet medical journal published last week — five months after Putin approved the vaccine — concluded that its Phase III trials indeed proved that it had some effect in fighting the virus.Russia-backed fighters in the Donbass region began distributing Sputnik V, claiming approval by their alleged “sovereign” government, in early February.“The leader of the so-called Donetsk republic Denis Pushilin said a first batch of ‘several thousand’ Sputnik V doses had arrived and that doctors and soldiers would be inoculated first starting from Monday,” the Moscow Times reported on February 1. Leonid Pasechnik, the self-proclaimed leader of separatist Luhansk, similarly announced a shipment from Russia of the product. Neither the Donetsk nor Luhansk separatists are known to have public health experts fighting in their war and they did not give any indication that they independently studied the effectiveness of the vaccine candidate.The separatists’ announcements escalated pressure on the Zelensky government to begin distributing vaccines. At press time, Ukraine has yet to begin vaccinating citizens. Under Covax, it is expecting nearly 2 million doses of “Coronavac,” a Chinese coronavirus candidate created by the Chinese company Sinovac. “Coronavac” is believed to be the least effective of the coronavirus vaccine candidates currently in widespread circulations; studies have shown it is only about 50 percent effective in combating infections.Ukrainian Health Minister officials also announced major purchases of some of the most successful vaccines currently available, including the American Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, believed to be about 95 percent effective. Kyiv has also contracted to purchase as many as 3.7 million doses of the European vaccine created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.Sinovac applied for formal approval of its vaccine this week.London / EuropeNational SecurityScienceChinacoronavirusDonbassRussiaSputnik VUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr Zelensky.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
931,"A couple caught having sex by police officers on Dartmoor on the coldest night for 26 years have earned praise from some social media users.The couple, who engaged in their tryst in temperatures of -3 °C (26.6 °F), were sent on their way by officers enforcing the anti-coronavirus lockdown and reported for a breach of the regulations, which could mean heavy fines.“Fornicating under the stars, on the moors, may seem like this years latest rom-com, but it is not an essential journey and certainly breaks social distancing guidance,” chided Tavistock Police in a sadly now-deleted tweet.“Please continue to abide by Covid-19 legislation to help prevent the spread of Covid,” they added.Members of the public who were perhaps not too concerned by the public health impact of an illicit fling on a bleak and frozen moor appeared rather sympathetic to the amorous pair, however.“In this weather?

Makes you proud to be British.👍— Ian Heard (@irheard) February 11, 2021The phrase “Makes you proud to be British” — usually a somewhat facetious expression of praise for a person or persons caught in a scandal involving some level of daring, has a colourful history, with some attributing its popularisation to Sir Winston Churchill.One of the most famous retellings of the story, which involved an incident not unlike the one the Dartmoor Two were involved in, comes from Churchill’s modern-day successor at 10 Downing Street, Boris Johnson, by way of the war-time leader’s grandson, Nicholas Soames.“One of [Churchill’s] Conservative ministers was a bugger, if you see what I mean, though he was also a great friend of my grandfather,” Johnson quoted the notoriously politically incorrect Soames as saying in his book The Churchill Factor.“He was always getting caught, but of course in those days the press weren’t everywhere, and nobody said anything. One day he pushed his luck because he was caught rogering a Guardsman on a bench in Hyde Park at three in the morning — and it was February, by the way,” Soames continued.“So the Chief Whip came down to Chartwell [Churchill’s home in Kent], and he walked into my grandfather’s study, where he was working at his upright desk. ‘Yes, Chief Whip,’ he said, half turning round, ‘how can I help you?’“The Chief Whip explained the unhappy situation. ‘He’ll have to go,’ he concluded.“There was a long pause, while Churchill puffed his cigar. Then he said: ‘Did I hear you correctly in saying that so-and-so has been caught with a Guardsman?’“‘Yes, Prime Minister.’“‘In Hyde Park?’“‘Yes, Prime Minister.’“‘On a park bench?’“‘That’s right, Prime Minister.’“‘At three o’clock in the morning?’“‘That’s correct, Prime Minister.’“‘In this weather!

932,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate. But I can do that without going out and fighting elections,” Farage said.Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitBrexit PartyBritish politicsCCPChannel MigrantsChinaChinese Communist PartyEU referendumNigel FarageReform UKRichard TiceukipUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
933,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Many Europeans are desperate for a coronavirus vaccine. But not just any vaccine.As AstraZeneca shots are rolling out to European Union nations this month, joining the Pfizer and Moderna doses already available, some people are baulking at being offered a vaccine that they perceive – fairly or not – as second-best.Poland began vaccinating teachers Friday with the AstraZeneca vaccine, and some had misgivings about being put in line for a vaccine they believe is less effective than the others.Ewelina Jankowska, the director of a primary and high school in Warsaw’s southern Wilanow district, said nobody in her school was enthusiastic about getting the AstraZeneca shot, although many signed up, eager for any protection against a virus that has upended their lives and their students’ schooling.“I still fear the illness more than the AstraZeneca vaccine,” said Jankowska, who was infected with COVID-19 in November and had a very slow recovery.AstraZeneca, an Anglo-Swedish company, developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford. While regulators in more than 50 countries, including the EU’s drug watchdog, have authorized its widespread use, it has attracted more criticism than others due to concerns about its human trials.Several European nations have recommended the drug only for people under 65, and other countries have recommended it for those under 55, because AstraZeneca’s trials included a relatively small number of older people.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot acknowledged the criticism but said regulators had reviewed the data and deemed the vaccine safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines are in short supply, he said, and the AstraZeneca shot offers high levels of protection against severe disease, which is the most important benchmark in fighting a virus that has killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide.“Is it perfect? No, it’s not perfect, but it’s great,” Soriot said Thursday. “We’re going to save thousands of lives and that’s why we come to work every day.”Brexit Britain ‘Towering Head and Shoulders’ Above EU on Vaccines https://t.co/43wTtZEiil— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021The World Health Organization says the AstraZeneca vaccine is about 63per cent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses. That’s less than the 95per cent effectiveness reported by Pfizer and Moderna, but experts caution against such comparisons as the studies were done at different times and under different conditions. Furthermore, all have proven extremely effective at preventing serious illness and death.“If you’re offered any approved vaccine, take it,” said Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “They have all been found safe. Vaccines are the world’s route back to some sort of normality.”French President Emmanuel Macron angered scientists last month when he called the AstraZeneca vaccine “quasi-ineffective” for people over 65 — a comment that came hours before the European Medicines Agency approved it and said it could be used for all adults, including those over 65. Those who criticized Macron argued that he had spoken irresponsibly and had encouraged vaccine scepticism.French Health Minister Olivier Veran, who is 40, made a point this week of getting the AstraZeneca vaccine to show government confidence in it for under-65s.Chief Eurocrat Complains Countries Treating Vaccine Development Like a ‘Space Race’ https://t.co/dKAFmKN3zt— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021Adding to AstraZeneca’s troubles have been criticism from the EU about delivery shortages, its lack of approval yet in the U.S., and a preliminary study that raised questions about the vaccine’s ability to combat a COVID-19 variant discovered in South Africa. In its favour, however, is that it is cheaper and can be stored at refrigerator temperatures – not the far colder temperatures required of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.In Cyprus, Health Minister Constantinos Ioannou warned that opting for one over another risks delaying inoculations, given the limited deliveries of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in the coming weeks, and he noted “all three vaccines reduce hospitalizations and deaths drastically.”Yet in Poland, Spain, and Italy, some unions complained that their members are slated to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine, expressing concerns they were being treated as less important than groups getting the Pfizer or Moderna doses.Police unions in Spain have raised concerns about a government decision to administer AstraZeneca shots to police, military, firefighters and teachers.Some Italian doctors in the private sector are declining AstraZeneca shots, saying they want the Pfizer or Moderna shots going to public health care workers.“I’m not a no-vax AstraZeneca. But for an at-risk population, health care workers, they should use the same vaccination strategy for everyone and not create any discrimination,” said Dr Paolo Mezzana, a Rome plastic surgeon who helps administer a Facebook group of private doctors. They have been posting refusals to accept the AstraZeneca shot after vaccinations began this week.German Vice-Chancellor Reportedly Slams 'Really S***' EU Vaccine Programme https://t.co/GVv3CedxOR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021In Poland, the government announced earlier this month that the planned delivery of more than 1 million AstraZeneca doses meant teachers could get their shots ahead of schedule because the vaccine would not be given to older adults.But instead of expressing relief, the head of the main teachers’ union, Slawomir Broniarz, criticized the use of the vaccine in remarks that, in turn, came under fire from scientists and the government.Michal Dworczyk, who leads the government’s vaccine effort, said he regretted “that some irresponsible politicians or trade unions have tried to scare teachers or cause such anxiety by giving false information about the AstraZeneca vaccine.”Yet a sense of misgiving has settled in among teachers, who already have been in conflict with the government for years over low wages and unpopular reforms.Patrycja Swistowska, who teaches second grade at the Wilanow school, said she signed up for the AstraZeneca shot despite her fears and confusion.“I feel that teachers are treated a bit worse and this is the vaccine that they offered us. They didn’t offer us the vaccines given to doctors and other professional groups,” said Swistowska, 39. “I am disoriented and I don’t feel good about this. We are paid worse and this is just another example of us being shown our place.”In Italy, the head of the SAP police union, Stefano Paoloni, argued that if officers believe they are getting a less-effective vaccine via the police force, they can opt out and wait to get another shot later when the rest of the population is vaccinated. That would defeat the strategy to vaccinate as many at-risk people as quickly as possible.Some unions are going ahead with the AstraZeneca rollout without complaining, reflecting gratitude to get any protection.Dr Arianna Patricarca, a 52-year-old Italian dentist who received the AstraZeneca shot Thursday, called it “a great opportunity and I am very happy that I did it.”Warsaw preschool director Agnieszka Grabowska also welcomed getting the AstraZeneca vaccine Friday.“It is a great relief,” said Grabowska, 48, adding that she was exhausted after a year of the pandemic.“I have been waiting for this moment all year,” she said.‘Totally Unacceptable’ – Illegal Migrants Getting Vaccines Before At-Risk Brits at 4-Star Hotel https://t.co/rCPhPXD1aO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 13, 2021Winfield reported from Rome.

934,"A 22-year-old man in the Paris no-go suburbs of Seine-Saint-Denis was sentenced to four years in prison after blackmailing underage girls for sex on social media.A court in the commune of Bobigny sentenced the man on Tuesday after finding him guilty of sexual assault on a minor.According to a report from the news website Actu, the man had blackmailed his victims, most of whom were underage and Muslim, on the social media app Snapchat. He had threatened to post compromising photographs on pornographic websites unless the young victims gave him more explicit photographs and videos or sexual favours.The 22-year-old, who worked as an insurance salesman, was arrested in December after demanding a 17-year-old Muslim girl meet him for sex at a Seine-Saint-Denis railway station after threatening to send photographs of the girl to her family.After being forced to commit a sexual act on the man, the high school girl reported the incident to the police who told her to reconnect with the suspect.

935,"Andras Lederer from the George Soros-backed Hungarian Helsinki Committee has called on the European Union to punish Hungary after accusing the country of engaging in migrant pushbacks in contradiction of a European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling.Mr Lederer criticised the European Commission for inaction over the alleged pushbacks along the Serbian border with Hungary, saying that the central European nation was acting in defiance of an ECJ ruling from December that stated that pushbacks were unlawful.“It’s not very often in the legal field that things are crystal clear,” Leder told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle and added: “But that is the case with ECJ rulings. They are binding, and Hungary must obey and implement them. But the Hungarian government is not doing it.”Lederer also added that the European Commission should consider punishing the Hungarian government, saying: “It would be possible to impose financial sanctions on Hungary, in the form of significant daily fines, for the non-execution of ECJ rulings.”“Hungary is not going to give in to pressure from pro-migration forces.

Groups like Human Rights Watch have claimed that Greece had expelled thousands of migrants in the Aegean sea.The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has also called on the European Union to investigate pushback allegations allegedly recorded by pro-migration NGOs.ImmigrationLondon / Europeborder securityEuropean UnionGeorge SorosHungarian Helsinki CommitteeHungaryMass Migrationpushbacks.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
936,"Leading Conservative politician Jacob Rees-Mogg ripped the London mayor as ‘Red Khan’ for the BLM-inspired commission he has established to audit the “diversity” of the capital’s monuments, street names, and other memorials.The colourful Leader of the House of Commons was speaking in response to Andrew Rosindell, the Member of Parliament for Romford — and a Conservative party colleague — who raised the issue of Mayor Sadiq Khan’s new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm and the fact that “unsurprisingly, it seems to be made up almost entirely of left-wing political activists, campaigners, and celebrities, instead of historians and experts”.“[D]oes my Right Honourable Friend share my concern about these unelected activists being givent he power to interfere with London street names and monuments, and will he consider granting a debate in Government time to discuss how we can defend our great capital history’s proud history and heritage?”“I absolutely agree with my Honourable Friend; it seems to me that the Mayor of London has replaced Red Ken as Red Khan,” replied Rees-Mogg, referring to the first man to hold the Labour-created office, hard-left controversialist Ken Livingstone.“Who would have thought that you would have a more left-wing leader of London than Ken Livingstone? But now we do, and Red Khan is he,” the Tory lamented.“It is quite wrong that these loony left-wing wheezes should be inflicted upon our great Metropolis, and I think the mayor in his zeal is potentially treading on the toes of council anyway; the councils have the right to name streets, by and large, not the mayor of London, and I don’t think he should interfere in things that are not his responsibility,” he continued.“And as I was saying on the Honours system, we should celebrate and glory in our wonderful history and in the great heroes of our nation, going back over centuries,” he added.Red Ken has been transmogrified into Red Khan. https://t.co/QrGCQksKpp— Jacob Rees-Mogg (@Jacob_Rees_Mogg) February 12, 2021One of the most controversial members of Mayor Khan’s so-called diversity commission is Toyin Agbetu, who in 2007 disrupted a service commemorated the 200-year anniversary of Britain’s abolition of the slave trade in Westminster Abbey by advancing on Queen Elizabeth II demanding an apology and screaming “you should be ashamed!”Video footage of the incident shows Agbetu tussling with security guards, shouting “Let go of me!” and shoving his finger in one of their faces, threatening “I’ll punch you out!”London / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeAndrew RosindellAntonio GramsciBlack Lives MatterBlack Lives Matter UKBLMBritish HistoryCommunity CohesionConservative PartydiversityFabian SocialismFabian SocietyHeritageHistoryIconoclasmlabourLabour PartyMulticulturalismNational Identitysadiq khanSJWsSocial Cohesionsocial justice warriorsstatuesToriesTory partyTraditionWokewokenessWokism.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
937,"More than five million migrants from the European Union have applied to live permanently in Britain under the EU settlement scheme, with applications still open until June 2021.Of those, nearly 2.5 million (2,497,600) have already been granted permanent leave to remain, and more than two million (2,039,800) have been granted pre-settled status, meaning that they can apply in five years for full legal residency.Another 38,900 had their applications refused, 50,600 were deemed invalid, and 51,400 were withdrawn or void, according to provisional Home Office figures reported by The Telegraph on Thursday.Since the EU Settlement Scheme opened in March 2019, 5,060,600 EU nationals have applied. Applications are still open until June 30th, 2021, five years and one week after the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. The status is open to all EU, European Economic Area (EEA), and Swiss citizens who were resident in the United Kingdom by December 31st, 2020 — the day the British finally left the EU institutions’ jurisdiction and became an independent nation once more.For those EU nationals who want to leave the United Kingdom and return to their home country, the British government has also opened up its generous migrant voluntary returns scheme normally offered to illegal aliens, failed asylum seekers, or others who have withdrawn their application for refugee status. They are entitled to free flights and even up to £2,000 in resettlement grants.The report was released just two weeks after the government opened up immigration routes to millions of people in Hong Kong to study, live, and work in the United Kingdom. Five years after arriving in Britain, Hong Kongers will be eligible to apply for settled status, and 12 months later, British citizenship.‘Take Back Control’? – UK Net Immigration Rises to 313,000, Driven by Non-EU Arrivals https://t.co/tg8FlTSDin— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 27, 2020The British population in 2019 was measured at 66,796,800, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures released in June 2020. In October 2019, the ONS reported that by mid-2031 the country’s population could hit 70 million — driven mainly by migration — though reports at the time suggested that that figure could be hit sooner.As well as Britain opening up to millions of Hong Kongers, another government policy which may accelerate Britain’s population to the milestone of 70 million is Boris Johnson’s post-Brexit immigration policy.While promising to echo Australia’s points-based system that treated all applicants on a level playing field, Mr Johnson’s does not include an annual cap on numbers, opening up the scheme to potentially uncontrolled immigration, which could ultimately hurt British workers — especially at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has put many people out of work.Weeks before the new immigration system came into effect, the chairman of the mass migration-sceptic Migration Watch UK think tank called the programme a “total surrender to big business”.“These new schemes will expose millions of UK jobs to competition from many millions of foreign workers for whom lower qualifications will be required, including for jobs paying little more than the National Living Wage. Nor will there be a cap on numbers or a need to give British workers a chance to apply first,” said Alp Mehmet.“It is a long way from the promised control,” he added, referencing the campaign slogan of Vote Leave — of which Johnson was a major figure — to “take back control” of the country’s laws and borders by voting to leave the EU.England Will Need to Build Over 100K Houses Per Year to Keep Up with Mass Migration https://t.co/RtmcNjDEra— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 30, 2020Breitbart London reported last week that the government was found to be “flying blind” on the true number of people in the country after some 1.25 million people “appeared” in population statistics.Oxford University’s Migration Observatory found that 2020 saw a 900,000 drop in the migrant population accompanied by an implausible 1.25 million rise in people born in Britain, and suggested that government figures were no longer reliable.The pandemic had put a halt to migration and population surveys meaning, according to the Observatory’s director Madeleine Sumption, that “there is absolutely massive uncertainty about what is going on with migration at the moment, because all the data sources we normally use have been hugely disrupted.”“This has left us flying blind just as the UK is introducing a new immigration system, and will make it more difficult to understand the impacts of new policies,” Ms Sumption added.Migration Watch UK’s Alp Mehmet told Breitbart London at the time that the “fact is, the government have little idea of what is going on,” and criticised the Johnson administration for having thrown the doors open with a “weak points-based system” and an “open-ended offer” to millions of Hong Kongers to migrate and settle.UK Deportations of Foreign Criminals Fell 79 per cent Last Year, Despite Patel’s Promises to ‘Get Tough’ https://t.co/5PazItcV8R— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 19, 2021ImmigrationLondon / EuropePoliticsBritainDemographicsDemographyEUEU migrantsEuropean Unionmass immigrationMass MigrationMigrantsmigrationUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
938,"Cambridge University and the BBC have become the latest British establishment institutions to have been accused of working in step with the dictatorship in Beijing, after signing deals with a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) tied tech giant.The University of Cambridge reportedly received a “generous gift” from Tencent Holdings, one of the largest technology firms in China, to fund engineering research.The university received money from Tencent to fund a quantum computing research project under Cambridge’s Dowling postdoctoral research fellowship, The Times reported on Wednesday.Tencent is one of the world’s most valuable companies, serving as the largest vendor of video games in the world. The Chinese tech giant also owns one of the country’s largest social media platforms, WeChat, through which the company enforces the strict censorship regime of the communist government.In December, a former senior CIA official told Foreign Policy magazine that the American intelligence agency had concluded with a “high-confidence reporting” that Tencent was initially funded by the CCP’s Ministry of State Security, the top civilian security agency in China.The CIA official said that Tencent received “seed investment” from the communist spy agency “when they were trying to build out the Great Firewall and the monitoring technology”.In 2019, Cambridge announced that the “technology giant Tencent has made a generous gift to fund a new five-year postdoctoral research fellowship in the department of engineering”. The funding was said to enable researchers “to bring their ideas from the lab to reality… in areas from smart city infrastructure to radical new medical treatments enabled with bioengineering for drug delivery”.Cambridge Univerity’s Jesus College is also linked with the Chinese tech firm, having hosted three times the ‘Yidan Prize Conference: Europe’, which is put on by Tencent’s co-founder Chen Yidan.Cambridge University claimed that they have a “robust” system in place for reviewing donations, saying: “Academic freedom is a fundamental principle, and no donor directs research.”Breitbart London had previously reported on Jesus College, when it was revealed to have received £155,000 from Communist Party linked Huawei for a research collaboration and £200,000 from China’s State Council for the establishment of a “UK-China Global Issues Dialogue Centre”.Chinese Communists Infiltrate British Universities, Confiscating Papers and Cancelling Events https://t.co/apQaws9ZS9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 6, 2019Britain’s publicly-funded broadcaster, the BBC, has also been swept up in the flurry of reports on Chinese influence.On Wednesday, The Telegraph reported that Tencent had signed a series of deals with the BBC to co-produce some of the broadcaster’s top programmes, including Sir David Attenborough’s climate change alarmist Blue Planet II wildlife series.The report claimed that in 2018, the BBC inked a three-year production deal with Tencent to make “content-rich documentaries”.Chinese expert at The Henry Jackson Society think tank, Sam Armstrong, said: “This is an appalling misjudgment by the BBC. Tencent is intricately connected to the Chinese State.”Armstrong went on to say that the move is not only a “PR disaster for the BBC”, but that it also puts into question the “moral judgement” of Director-General of the BBC Tim Davie for “so thoroughly” embracing the CCP-tied firm.A BBC Studios spokesman said: “As a major exporter of British content to the world, and consistent with Sino-British trade policy and initiatives, BBC Studios has had relationships in place with Chinese media companies for many years to bring high-quality British television programmes to audiences in China.”China Threatens Revenge After UK Bans Communist Propaganda Outlet https://t.co/qqrZ6TYhvx— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021The revelations come after Oxford University was reported on Monday to have renamed its 120-year-old Wykeham professorship after Tencent in exchange for £700,000 from the Chinese tech firm.Professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent Matthew Goodwin said that a review should be carried out on the growing influence of the CCP on British universities.“Most members of the public would question why we’re letting universities take that amount of money to sponsor internal chairs,” he said, adding that the move from Oxford would “give [Tencent] serious credibility”.Oxford University defended the move, saying: “Tencent has been approved as an appropriate donor by our independent committee… Our donors have no say in setting research and teaching programmes.”British universities have come under increasing scrutiny for ties to the Chinese state.

939,"A number of European Parliamentarians criticized Poland during a debate Tuesday for its recently enacted ban on eugenic abortions of children with disabilities.In October 2020, Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal outlawed abortions on the basis of fetal anomalies, insisting that there can be “no protection of the dignity of an individual without the protection of life.”The court argued that aborting a child because of probable birth defects constituted eugenics, an effort to purify the race by purging society of the weak and undesirable, notoriously practiced by the Nazis against Jews and disabled persons, and advocated by Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger against blacks and minorities in the United States.Previously, babies with Down syndrome and other anomalies could be legally aborted in Poland, a provision the European Parliament is determined to reinstate.According to a recent report, the increase in eugenic abortions in Europe have cut the number of births of babies with Down syndrome by more than 50 percent. Data on European births seem to confirm the fears of those who have contended that increased prenatal testing for Down syndrome has led many women to selectively abort their children, the report stated.On Tuesday, E.U. equality Commissioner Helena Dalli said Poland’s abortion ruling is a sign of the deterioration of sexual and reproductive rights of women in the country, AP reported.Frances Fitzgerald, of Ireland’s Fine Gael Party, said the abortion ruling was “bleak and inhumane” while Terry Reintke, of Germany’s Green party, said the Polish government is turning the country into “a place where men will have control over women’s bodies.”Danish MEP Karen Melchior went further still, declaring that women bearing children with lethal fetal defects would now be forced “to give birth to a corpse.”The European Parliament, which has adopted an ever more radical pro-abortion stance in its international advocacy, had already issued a formal resolution on November 26, 2020 in which it “strongly condemns the Constitutional Tribunal’s ruling and the setback to women’s SRHR in Poland.”The ruling “puts women’s health and lives at risk,” the resolution stated, by limiting “access to safe and legal abortion in Poland,” adding that “universal access to healthcare and SRHR [which includes abortion] are fundamental human rights.”The resolution went on to insist “that the performance of an abortion should not be included in the criminal code, as this has a chilling effect on doctors who refrain from providing SRHR services out of fear of criminal sanctions.”In recent years, the European Parliament has evolved into a global activist for pro-abortion legislation around the planet.On January 28, 2021, the National Congress of Honduras ratified constitutional reforms prohibiting abortion and acknowledging that the unborn enjoy the same basic rights as those already born, a decision sharply criticized by the European Parliament as well as by the United Nations and the pro-abortion lobby.“The unborn shall be considered as born for all rights accorded within the limits established by law,” states the amended article 67 of the Constitution. “It is prohibited and illegal for the mother or a third party to practice any form of interruption of life on the unborn, whose life must be respected from conception.”In a formal declaration, the European Parliament said that Honduras’ constitutional reform prohibiting abortion “is clearly against international norms of human rights.”“It constitutes a regressive measure that is contrary to the State’s international obligations to avoid measures restricting or undermining progress towards the full realization of human rights,” the communiqué added.

941,"Chief Brexit negotiator David Frost has blamed Brussels for the ongoing tensions with London, remarking that the bloc is struggling to accept “the existence of a genuinely independent actor in their neighbourhood”.Lord Frost made the comments during to a House of Lords committee on the European Union on Tuesday, in light of several emerging issues Brexit Britain has experienced with the bloc, adding that he had been told informally that Brussels is expecting to ask for an extension to ratify the UK-EU trade agreement.While the deal came into effect on January 1st, it is yet to be officially endorsed by the bloc’s member states and the European Parliament, and in the meantime, the deal is in force only on a provisional basis. The British parliament has already agreed to the document.The British diplomat said, according to the BBC, that Brexit Britain wanted “friendly cooperation between sovereign equals as our vision of the future”.However, he said: “I don’t think it has been quite the experience of the last few weeks, if we are honest about it.”“I think the EU is still adjusting somewhat, as we thought they might, to the existence of a genuinely independent actor in their neighbourhood,” Mr Frost added.'Remoaner' elites have complained that they will no longer be able to afford their au pairs following Brexit, as immigration laws now mandate that migrants must receive a living wage. https://t.co/L7ph5hw4Wi— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 7, 2021The adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson outlined issues such as the head of the EU’s executive arm, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposing and then withdrawing an internal border on the island of Ireland to stop the alleged threat of EU vaccines crossing the border into the UK.The move would have threatened the Belfast Agreement — an arrangement that for four years, Eurocrats demanded not be put at risk post-Brexit — and which was heavily criticised within bloc’s diplomatic circle, with one representative calling for von der Leyen to resign.The EU is also offended that Britain has declined to give its overseas mission to the UK the same status as that of a sovereign state, which the Foreign Office reportedly said would set a precedent for other global organisations to demand rights such as diplomatic immunity for their ambassadors and embassies.The drama had allegedly resulted in the bloc postponing a meeting between British representatives and EU officials in Brussels, though sources told the media that Britain had asked for no such introduction in the first place.Further acts by Europeans — including the bloc banning the import of British shellfish and French President Emmanuel Macron claiming that the UK’s Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was only “quasi-effective” for older people — had also increased tensions.Brexit Britain ‘Towering Head and Shoulders’ Above EU on Vaccines https://t.co/43wTtZEiil— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021“I hope we will get over this. It is going to require a different spirit, probably, from the EU, but I am sure we are going to see that and some of this subside as we go forward,” Mr Frost said on Tuesday.Frost also said that he had “heard informally from the commission today that we are likely to get a formal request to extend the two-month period that is in the treaty for ratification on the EU side”, with a European Commission spokesman confirming that day the bloc had agreed to extend the ratification period until the end of April.Another ongoing issue is the wider problem that the European Union is having with producing vaccinations for the hundreds of millions of residents in the bloc.With excessive bureaucracy at fault for the delays, von der Leyen and her Commission have sought to punish Britain, threatening to stop the export of vaccines produced in Europe under contract for the UK, and even demanding that doses made in the UK be sent to the Continent to make up for their shortfall.Brexit leader and Reform UK head Nigel Farage said that the moves by the “nasty” and “vindictive” EU are proof that the UK was right to leave the bloc.Freeports: British Towns and Cities Bid to Become Post-Brexit Tax-Free Zones https://t.co/j2XKN0BkON— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021EconomyLondon / EuropePoliticsBrexitDavid FrostEU trade dealEuropean UnionUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
942,"A secondary school in England has removed the names of Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and British wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill from school houses after teenage students branded the famous Brits as “intolerant”.Students at the Seaford Head School in East Sussex claimed Sir Winston — the man generally credited with marshalling the efforts to defeat the Nazis and routinely thought of as one of the greatest Britons ever– was a “figure who promoted racism and inequality, unfairly imprisoning and torturing many”. The school claimed that honouring him would go against the school’s policy against “intolerance and discrimination”.The teenagers also took aim at J.K. Rowling, saying per The Telegraph: “We no longer think that JK Rowling is a suitable representative, because of her recent words about the trans community.”The houses on the campus named after Nelson Mandela and Florence Nightengale escaped from the woke purge, however, and will remain unchanged.The pressure from the students successfully forced the administrators at the school to remove the names from the houses, which will be renamed following a student body vote.A spokeswoman for the school said: “The Student Leadership group decided to consult on the names of the four houses with a view to re-introducing house names that are rooted in the local community. This exercise involves all of the student body.”Delingpole: ‘Churchill Was Racist’, Say BLM. Wait Till They Hear About the Guy He Beat… https://t.co/1Zem8gyO1y— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 9, 2020The historical accuracy of the allegations against Sir Winston was derided by the author of Churchill: Walking with Destiny, Andrew Roberts who said: “Parents of children at Seaford School, and anyone considering sending their children there in future, need to know that the historical knowledge there is so abysmally low that the teachers believe that Winston Churchill committed crimes of which he was in fact entirely innocent.“Instead of trying to combat woke ignorance, they have submitted to it without trying to discover the truth. Churchill is in fact an incredibly inspirational figure for youth,” Roberts added.Britain’s wartime hero has increasingly become a target of the iconoclastic left in the United Kingdom, with his statue in Parliament Square in London being defaced last year by Black Lives Matter radicals who scrawled on the plinth: “Was a Racist” under his name.Churchill’s former home was also placed on a BLM-inspired shame list produced by the National Trust for supposed ties to British colonialism.Last year, J.K. Rowling also became a target of leftist witch mobs after writing that only women can menstruate and that: “If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased.”Following criticism from the president of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Foundation, Rowling returned a 2019 award from the organisation, saying that the foundation “has stated that there is no conflict between the current radical trans rights movement and the rights of women.”“The thousands of women who’ve got in touch with me disagree, and, like me, believe this clash of rights can only be resolved if more nuance is permitted in the debate,” Rowling said.Woke University Pushes 'Decolonised Curriculum' to Replace Medieval English Courses https://t.co/Sie1WK2TTm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 6, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaEducationLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBlack Lives Matter UKBritish HistoryBritish SchoolsCancel CulturecancelledJ.K.

943,"At least ten former staff members are ready to come forward as claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex bullied and “humiliated” aides are probed.Allegations that Meghan, the former Suits starlet and wife of Prince Harry, inflicted “emotional cruelty and manipulation” on staff are being investigated by Buckingham Palace, after a former aide revealed she had been the subject of a bullying complaint and accused her of driving a number of people out of their jobs.“A group of people are queuing up to be involved. They have been silent for too long and there is much to talk about,” a source told the left-wing Daily Mirror.Claims that Meghan brought a certain Hollywood entitlement into British public life have swirled for years, with her husband accused of doing little to restrain her — “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets,” he is alleged to have shouted at the Queen’s dresser during an incident involving a diamond tiara.“I… witnessed Meghan turn and ‘hiss’ at a member of her entourage, clearly incandescent with rage about something, and demand to leave,” the royal editor at the Daily Mail said of one alleged incident during a public event.“I later saw that same – female – highly distressed member of staff sitting in an official car, with tears running down her face. Our eyes met and she lowered hers, humiliation etched on her features.”Prince William Angered by Meghan and Harry's 'Insulting, Disrespectful, and Petulant' Attitude to Queen https://t.co/kvuRJbdJA9— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 21, 2021Before Meghan and Harry abandoned their duties as working royals — but not their titles — to pursue money-making ventures and activism in the United States, their communications secretary wrote to Prince William’s private secretary said he was “very concerned that the Duchess [of Sussex, Meghan] was able to bully two PAs out of the household in the past year. The treatment of X was totally unacceptable.”He added that “the Duchess seems intent on always having someone in her sights” and was “bullying Y and seeking to undermine her confidence.”“We have had report after report from people who have witnessed unacceptable behaviour towards Y,” he warned.The pair appear to be framing the revival of the complaints against Meghan as retaliation for a tell-all interview they have filmed with Oprah Winfrey, which will air on Monday in the United Kingdom.Clips advertising the interview give the impression that they will paint the Royal Family in a negative light, with Meghan describing her experience as “almost unsurvivable” and claiming that “The Firm” — senior royals — of “perpetuating falsehoods” against her and her husband.A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has denied the bullying allegations against her, saying: “Let’s just call this what it is — a calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation.”However, the main thrust of the Buckingham Palace probe seems to be whether or not complaints about her while she was still a working royal were handled correctly, with there being some suggestion that efforts were made to make them “go away” rather than upset her.“Everyone knew that the institution would be judged by her happiness,” a source told The Times.The row comes as the Queen’s 99-year-old husband — Harry’s grandfather — is suffering an extended stay in hospital, at one point undergoing a heart procedure.Pray for Her: Meghan Markle Laments ‘I Was the Most Trolled Person in the Entire World’ https://t.co/PMRl0n8GfR— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2020EntertainmentLondon / EuropeSocial JusticeBritainBritish Royal FamilybullyingMeghan Markleprince harryroyal familyUnited KingdomWokeWoke Royals.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
944,"The United Kingdom has overtaken the European Union in the total number of people given a vaccination shot against coronavirus, despite having less than a sixth of the population to innoculate.While the shock and outrage across European capitals over the continental power bloc’s failures to acquire enough vaccines to protect European Union citizens have dominated headlines for weeks, until now the EU had actually managed to vaccinate more people than the United Kingdom, although it was far behind proportionally.Yet according to figures collected by the University of Oxford-based research project Our World in Data, the UK — despite having a population of 67 million compared to the 448 million of the wider European Union — has now vaccinated more people than the whole EU put together, both in per capita and outright terms.Source: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirusThe leadership of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and her team came under massive criticism — particularly from Paris and Berlin whose own individual efforts have very likely been considerably held back by the EU’s incompetence — after it was revealed that while the EU had given just a couple of per cent of its population injections, the UK was racing ahead in the mid-teens.Von der Leyen was moved to remark that in this regard, Brexit Britain more resembled a “speed boat” to the European Union’s lumbering oil tanker.As of Wednesday, the United Kingdom had given a vaccine dose to 12.65 million people, and the 27 member states of the European Union had managed 650,000 fewer shots at 12 million. In all, 2.7 per cent of people in the EU have had at least one vaccine injection, while 18.6 per cent of people in Britain had got one or more injection.While Brexit Britain is now ahead in per capita and outright terms when it comes to the number of people given in injection, the chairman of the German parliament’s health committee rejected the comparison on Tuesday, saying differing strategies meant, in his opinion, comparing “apples and pears”.Committee leader and member of the German Parliament Erwin Rüddel said “the strategy is different” because the UK is working to give as many people as possible one shot and following up with second vaccination top-ups later. Germany and the European Union, on the other hand, were trying to give people in “vulnerable groups” two shots sooner, leaving others in the general population unprotected for longer.
While the EU 27 states have administered around four and a half million more shots in total than the UK, it remains the case that the UK is on course to have vaccinated the whole nation months before the EU, and possibly any of its member states individually, will manage the same.Despite the major discrepancy between the EU and the UK in terms of their capacity to offer vaccinations to their own populations, in terms of the outright number of injections give, both pale into insignificance to the United States, which has given over 43 million shots — 9.8 per cent of the population.HealthLondon / EuropeSciencecoronavirusEuropean UnionFranceGermanyUnited KingdomUniversity of OxfordUrsula von der LeyenVaccine.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
945,"Just when you thought Coronafascism had reached peak insanity along comes another politician yelling ‘hold my beer!’. Today it is the turn of Britain’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock with his genius new rule in which lying where you’ve been on holiday has now become an offence punishable with a 10-year jail sentence.Let’s pause, for a moment, to relish the jack-booted, face-stomping totalitarian cruelty of the crazed dictator Hancock’s outrageous ruling.What it means is that any Briton who returns to the UK from a holiday anywhere from the Cape Verde islands (a hugely popular winter sun destination) to the Seychelles, from South Africa or Tanzania, or even, ridiculously, from Portugal, must spend 10 days — and £1750 in expenses — in quarantine at some crappy, charmless hotel. And if they try to wriggle out of it by lying to the Border Control officer as to where they’ve been, then they face 10 years in prison.Ten years in prison is the maximum term normally given for: rioting, making threats to kill, indecent assault, firearm possession, burglary with intent to commit rape; indecency with children under 14.It is longer than you’d get for some sex offences involving children; carrying a loaded firearm; racially aggravated assault; incest. These carry a maximum seven-year sentence.So, to spell it out: if you try to grab a cheeky break on the Algarve and don’t tell the UK border authorities where you’ve been, Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, thinks you deserve a longer prison sentence than if, say, you’d molested your 14-year old niece.In what possible way is this a just or proportionate addition to Britain’s legal code?As the distinguished barrister Jonathan Sumption – who sat on the UK’s Supreme Court between 2012 and 2018 – writes in the Telegraph:Laws like these […] are the work of people who think there is no limit to the misery, oppressive cruelty, economic damage or injustice that we must put up with if it reduces infections.Lord Sumption goes on:The main charge to be levelled at the present government is not that they have the balance wrong. It is that they are not interested in balance at all. They are not natural tyrants, but they believe, like every tyrant that ever lived, that the end justifies the means.A senior Tory once told me that Hancock was widely despised by his fellow Conservative parliamentarians and that he had a ‘Messiah Complex.’ The fact that even his fellow MPs consider Hancock to be a loathsome loon is small consolation when he currently has so much power.Sure, one day in the future we will be able to laugh at the idea that in 2021 Britain’s response to coronavirus was so bizarrely over the top that illicit foreign travel earned you a stiffer sentence than child sexual abuse. But currently, we are living the nightmare for real. And what’s maybe even more terrifying is that so many drooling lapdogs of this increasingly fascist government are happy to go along with it.Here, for example, is a Conservative MP lending his support to a Tweet by an influential political gossip columnist by the name of Tom Harwood.I agree with Tom.  The stakes are too high for this not to be an offence with the most serious consequences. https://t.co/uXv1E4IfUo— Simon Clarke MP (@SimonClarkeMP) February 10, 2021Harwood, you’ll note, is not holding Hancock’s draconian new rule to account but actually applauding it – even hinting that it doesn’t go far enough.Suppose, like more than a few Britons, you have a holiday home in Portugal – or you’ve even settled there. Well now the only way you can return to your home country – perhaps to visit friends or relatives – is if you first spend ten days in what Lord Sumption accurately describes as ‘solitary confinement’. And if you try to avoid this misery and indignity, then as far as Harwood is concerned, you are a ‘lying jetsetter’ who has exposed Britain to some deadly new horror.Lord Sumption, more sensibly, notes:The quarantine rules are a form of solitary confinement. They are brutal, disproportionate, inhumane and economically destructive. They are also of limited value as the virus is already endemic here and spontaneously mutates all the time. Unwelcome mutations are just as likely to originate in the UK. The so-called Kent variant probably did, as did several cases of the South African variant. We are probably a net exporter of mutant viruses.Quite. It would be nice to think that Sumption speaks here for how most British people feel. And that for those who didn’t feel this way, the gobsmacking excess of Hancock’s deranged regulation will be the final straw – the moment when people finally wake up to the fact that they are now living in a dictatorship.My fear, though, is that the majority will agree with Harwood.If that’s the case then Britain is lost.London / EuropeBoris JohnsoncoronavirusCOVID-19holidayMatt HancockSimon ClarkeTom HarwoodtravelUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
946,"UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that his office is talking to global officials about introducing an “internationally-recognised system” to facilitate overseas travel during the pandemic — just days after Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that there were “no plans” to implement a vaccine passport.Mr Shapps said that he was talking to his counterpart in Singapore and will be discussing with his equivalent in the United States about such an immunity certificate, which he compared to the “Yellow Fever card” demanded by some countries before entry. But he denied there would be any such “vaccine passports” required for undertaking everyday tasks or accessing services in Britain.“When it comes to international travel, just as we have things like the Yellow Fever card… I imagine that in the future there will be an international system where countries will want to know that you’ve been potentially vaccinated or potentially had tests taken before flying,” the transport minister told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday.“The UK government is speaking to other governments about this,” Mr Shapps confirmed, as well as saying that the government was talking to bodies such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) “about how best to ensure that there are internationally recognised standards”.Mr Shapps’s remarks come days after Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that the government had “no plans” to introduce vaccine passports for international travel, calling them “discriminatory”.The Conservative Party minister had told the BBC on Sunday: “Of course, you have the evidence that you’ve been vaccinated held by your GP, and if other countries require you to show proof of that evidence, then that is obviously up to those countries.“But we’ve given the first dose to 11.5 million people, and we have no plan of introducing a vaccine passport.”Lord Sumption Brands Lockdown ‘Thoroughly Inhumane’ https://t.co/OwoC14VOnZ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 10, 2021Vaccine passport advocate Tony Blair has not only backed the introduction of “health passports” but said that Britain should take the lead on the international stage in the formalisation of a “Global Covid Travel Pass”.Mr Shapps’ remarks follow earlier reports that the British government was talking to countries such as Greece about “vaccine passports”, with some holiday destination favourites expected to demand proof of immunity or vaccination of the Chinese coronavirus before entry.Denmark announced last week its intention to roll out such a “passport” by the end of February — making it the first in the world — to facilitate international travel for business. The country’s minister suggested that the document could also be used as “extra security” when reopening Danish society.The British transport secretary, however, sought to make the distinction between such an international travel document and an immunity certificate, or also otherwise called a “vaccine passport”, needed to access services or got to the pub in the UK, which, he said, “I think is not on the cards”.British government sources believe bosses will be able to use Health and Safety regulations to fire workers who do not get vaccinated. https://t.co/sFgMFKjp8D— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021Last year, Mr Zahawi had said that while the UK would never mandate people take the vaccine, he admitted that private businesses might demand proof of immunity before being allowed into pubs, restaurants, cinemas, or stadiums.In January, Remainer campaigner and London plumbing mogul Charlie Mullins announced a “no vaccine, no job” policy, saying he would refuse to hire anyone who was not vaccinated, adding the requirement to his employment contracts.A government source revealed this week that businesses might be able to fire their unvaccinated staff under health and safety laws, saying: “If someone is working in an environment where people haven’t been vaccinated, it becomes a public health risk.”‘Out of Control!’ — Travellers to the UK Face 10 Years in Prison for Lying About Corona Travel History https://t.co/RPdzKjtVyV— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 9, 2021London / EuropePoliticsSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19Grant Shappsimmunity passportUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
947,"Leftist Mayor of London Sadiq Khan unveiled a Black Lives Matter inspired ‘diversity’ commission on Tuesday, which will review all historical monuments in the British capital.Mr Khan’s Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm, which is comprised of left-wing activists and celebrities, will seek to “improve diversity” in London, targeting statues, street names, memorials, and building names.The stated intention of the group will be to determine what “legacies should be celebrated” and to increase representation among “Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, women, LGTBQ+ and disabled groups,” a press release from the mayor’s office said.Mr Khan’s fifteen-member commission includes Pakistani-British Star Wars actor Riz Ahmed, who has previously suggested that a lack of diversity on television and in film could lead teenagers to join ISIS.The commission also includes social rights activist Toyin Agbetu, who gained national attention in 2007 after he confronted the Queen and then-Prime Minister Tony Blair at an event celebrating the end of slavery, a practice the United Kingdom with its Royal Navy had worked to stamp out.Busting into Westminster Abbey, Agbetu shouted: “You should be ashamed. We should not be here. This is an insult to us,” adding: “You, the Queen, should be ashamed!”Another prominent leftist member of the commission is art critic Aindrea Emelife, who came out in support of replacing the statue of British philanthropist Edward Colston with a Black Lives Matter activist.Emelfie wrote in July that she hoped the BLM statue would “catalyse a call for action, for a new world, for a new sculptural legacy.”On Tuesday, Ms Emelfie claimed in an interview with The Guardian that the point of the commission is “not just about taking down statues, it’s about creating new commissions that will inspire generations.

Our capital has a rich and proud history spanning thousands of years, and it should be left intact for our children to enjoy.”“This motley crew of unelected activists, motivated by Critical Race Theory and other such destructive ideologies, should not have any authority to change our street names and erase our history and culture,” he added.Mr Kurten went on to vow that if elected mayor, he would dissolve the woke commission “immediately”.London Assembly Member Peter Whittle also cast doubt on Khan’s commission, writing on social media: What right does this mayor and these people have to sit in judgment of London’s history? Or ‘which legacies should be celebrated’? No right at all. And we will also be paying for the privilege.”Khan’s Red Guard: London Mayor Vows to Replace Monuments with Statues of LGBTQ+ and Minority Figures https://t.co/XgjsXs8XG2— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 9, 2020Announcing the creation of the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm in June of last year, Sadiq Khan said that London’s “greatest strength” is its “diversity” but claimed that the capital’s “statues, road names and public spaces reflect a bygone era.”“It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade, and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored,” Khan added.The announcement came just one day after Black Lives Matter radical activists tore down the statue honouring slave owner, trader, and philanthropist Sir Edward Colston in Bristol, ultimately dumping the statue into the local harbour.It remains to be seen, however, how much freedom the commission will have in removing historical monuments in London, as Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced in January that he will be empowered with the final say on the removal of statues throughout the country.The move from the Conservative government was actually successful this month in blocking a left-wing Labour-run council from removing the statue of British war hero General Sir Redvers Buller in Exeter, Devon.Black Lives Matter disorder spread across the Atlantic with remarkable speed in 2020 after the death of George Floyd in the United States, with statues torn down or vandalized across the country and London plunged into violent disorder, despite lockdowns. https://t.co/WrQ4h1woVS— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 5, 2021Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropePoliticsSocial JusticeBlack Lives MatterBlack Lives Matter UKBritish Historydavid kurtendiversityhistorical monumentsIconoclasmLonodnMulticulturalismpeter whittleRiz Ahmedsadiq khanstatue warsstatuesUnited KingdomWoke Culture.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Newly-arrived migrants are typically given two-year apartment contracts before they are expected to move elsewhere.“When refugees come to a municipality, we guarantee housing for two years. In Sundbyberg we have said that we give families with children four years to find a home. During these two years you get a temporary contract, and lots of help from social services, housing coaches and the like,” Schilling said.The leftist group wrote a response to the allegations of intimidation saying, “Our intention was never to intimidate or threaten them. In addition, we believe that it must be [compared] to the discomfort experienced on a daily basis by the evicted tenants.”Since the height of the migrant crisis in 2015, several Swedish municipalities have reported financial problems due to the large numbers of migrants they have provided for in terms of housing and social assistance.In 2019, the municipality of Bengtsfors stated that it was looking for government aid to avoid possible bankruptcy due to the costs associated with migrants and the fact many were unemployed and not contributing to the tax base.Sweden: Municipality Inundated with Migrants Faces Tax Crisis as Native Swedes Flee https://t.co/It6p54Nxaf— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 1, 2019ImmigrationLondon / Europefar-left activist groupsfar-left ideologyhousingOpen Borderspro-migrant groupsSweden.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
949,"Greece and Israel agreed to a coronavirus vaccine passport “trial run” scheme, the countries’ leaders announced in Jerusalem.Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has been one of the leading voices in the European Union pushing for the adoption of vaccine passports, as the tourism industry upon which his country thrives has all but collapsed during the pandemic.At a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Greek leader said on Monday: “We need to facilitate travellers once they provide easy proof of vaccination and this is what we intend to do with Israel.”“I expect what we will be doing with Israel to be a trial run for what we can do with other countries,” Mitsotakis added in comments reported by Ekathimerini.Mr Netanyahu said that the scheme between the two countries would allow travel “without any limitations, no self-isolation, nothing” for those who can prove that they have been inoculated against the virus.Tourism is at the backbone of the Greek economy, employing about a fifth of all workers in the country. The industry was incredibly hard hit by the Chinese coronavirus last year, seeing revenues drop from around 15 billion euros in 2019 to just over three billion euros in 2020.While the European Union has said that it is “premature” to introduce bloc-wide vaccination passports, Margaritis Schinas, the European Commission’s vice-president, said last month that it is time for the EU to begin to “recognise” vaccine passports.The bloc’s health commissioner, Greek politician Stella Kyriakides, also revealed that the EU is currently in “active discussion” as to how to adopt such a scheme.Several member states have already announced their intentions to implement the scheme, including Spain, Iceland, and Denmark, the latter of which is expected to launch the world’s first such passport later this month.Denmark to Rollout Coronavirus 'Vaccine Passports' Early This Year https://t.co/dneAIcs2sx— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 9, 2021On Sunday, Britain’s Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed that the government would not implement a vaccine passport system, saying that it would be “discriminatory” in nature.However, the government is currently funding two projects to create digital QR code-based vaccine passports, including one from Logifect, which is expected to be launched next month.While the UK has been reticent to endorse the idea publicly, sources within government told The Telegraph that officials are considering ‘numerous’ options for vaccine passports. Government minister Grant Shapps has said the government is discussing the possibility of an “internationally recognised” corona passport.Travel industry leaders have begun pressuring the government to implement vaccination passports in the hopes of saving the sector.The chief executive of Saga Travel, Nick Stace, said that it would help the British people “be among the first people in the world to travel the world again”, adding that it would prop up the government’s post-Brexit vision of a “Global Britain”.Others have warned of the implications that it would have on personal freedoms and privacy rights, including civil liberties watchdog Big Brother Watch, which has previously said: “Vaccine passports would create the backbone of an oppressive digital ID system and could easily lead to a health apartheid that’s incompatible with a free and democratic country.“They’d normalise identity checks, health inspections and increase state control over citizens.”UK Govt Begins Work on QR Code Coronavirus ‘Freedom Passports’, Denies System is ‘Imminent’ https://t.co/jDZvgFCsXO— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 23, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaHealthIsrael / Middle EastLondon / EuropeBenjamin NetanyahuborderscoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineCovid VaccineGreeceimmigrationIsraelKyriakos MitsotakisUnited KingdomVaccinevaccine passport.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Such weapons are not generally held in civilian hands in France, where firearms lawsSamir Ider, the head of the trafficking network, who was said to not only be violent but also radicalised, had hidden 600 grams (1lb 5oz) of TNT explosive and 600 grams of pentaerythritol tetranitrate, which is used to make the explosive semtex, a preferred weapon of Islamist terrorists. He also had in his possession four detonators and three firing systems.Police Find Rocket Launcher and Other Weapons in French No-Go Zone Suburbhttps://t.co/eGcracQ7ge— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 22, 2017According to Le Point, French authorities had been investigating the network, which operated in the no-go Paris suburbs of Seine-Saint-Denis, for at least two years prior to dismantling it and said that 42-year-old Ider had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for cocaine importation in 2011.Ider, along with his brother and eight others were brought before a court last week but despite the dismantling of the heavily armed network, it is unlikely drug dealing will disappear.The commune of Saint-Ouen, where the network primarily operated and supplied drugs, would see at least 10-12,000 euros worth of drug deals per day.The raid is not the first time military-grade weapons have been found in Paris’ no-go suburbs in recent years.

951,"The United Kingdom’s equivalent to the CIA has admitted that it has begun recruiting foreign-born spies for the first time in a supposed bid to increase “diversity”.The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), more commonly known as MI6, will officially expand its recruitment of candidates to those born outside of the UK, however, they will still require to have a British passport.A source within Whitehall told The Times on Wednesday that the overseas spy agency wants to have access to the “biggest talent pool”.“If you narrow the criteria to a British national you will end up with lots of people who are British and educated at red-brick universities. We want a diversification of thought, a diverse workforce, not people who all think in similar ways.“It is about having a good mix of minds. But also, by having different nationalities from different backgrounds, we can be more effective at spying,” the source said.The new rules may require that dual citizenship candidates forgo their non-British citizenship.MI6 will still require that candidates have at least one parent with “substantial ties to the UK” or is or was a British citizen.Children of Migrants Allowed to Spy for Britain for the First Time in Diversity Drive  https://t.co/w7QhOhRoLh— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 25, 2018Last month, the Daily Star reported on a series of recruitment advertisements from the security agency to field part-time “James Bond-style” spies, offering the opportunity to “spice up dull lives” for both “UK and foreign nationals alike.”One advert entitled “Tell Me A Secret”, said: “The Secret Intelligence Service seeks individuals with diverse skill sets and life experiences for part-time and consulting roles to enhance our core mission.”People of Chinese and Russian heritage are reportedly on the top of the list for desired recruits.“MI6 is basically saying to anyone fed up with their country’s regime that they can work for British intelligence part-time,” a source told the paper.“They would travel on business or holiday. That will be very attractive for a corporate executive looking to spice up an otherwise dull life,” the source added.In 2019, MI6 released its first advertisement on YouTube. The ad was set in a barbershop, in an apparent attempt to recruit more black and ethnic minority spies.“It’s not about finding the secret button for your ejector seat. It’s finding common ground with a stranger, anywhere. And gaining their trust,” the advert said.“MI6, secretly we’re just like you,” the advert concluded.The loosening of official requirements for the spy agency began in 2018 when then Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service Sir Alex Younger scrapped the century-old requirement that spies must have two British born parents, allowing the children of migrants to enter the service for the first time.“The Service I am proud to lead is global, modern, and most capable with a deserved reputation of being one of the best intelligence agencies in the world,” Sir Alex said.Idris Elba: The Next James Bond ‘Could Be a Black Woman‘  https://t.co/eJgNWlQLnz— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 23, 2018Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaLondon / EuropeNational SecuritySocial JusticeAlex YoungerIntelligenceintelligence communityJames BondMI6SpiesspySpyingUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
952,"Just weeks after controversy raged over useless government food handouts for poor children, an opportunity has arisen: buy the tons of quality English cheese languishing in warehouses after the Westminster-imposed hospitality shutdown and post it directly to people in need.With the United Kingdom approaching the first anniversary of its coronavirus lockdown, the hospitality industry — the fleeting ‘eat out to help out’ days aside — remains in a state of stasis, if not outright collapse. This has meant a huge hit on the suppliers to those customer-facing businesses, particularly of perishable goods people love to enjoy while out, but may not necessarily think to buy for home.According to Britain’s state broadcaster, one such sector is speciality English cheese companies, which supplied victuals to restaurants and pubs for piquant postprandial nibbles, but whose customers vanished overnight with the government’s endless on-off lockdowns. Indeed, the BBC notes nearly two whole tons of quality Cornish Blue cheese is on the verge of being thrown away because, having matured ready for consumption, there are only a few weeks in which it is still good to eat and nobody is buying.This is a much greater issue for dairy products like cheese than for other producers in the hospitality sector. While the factory producing cheese can slow down or even suspend production, the dairy farmers supplying that business still have cows producing milk every day, and it is this end of the industry that gets hit hardest.Reagan distributed stocks of ""government cheese"" bought to help dairy farmers to poor families. @BorisJohnson and @michaelgove  should tell @DefraGovUK to do same thing now, saving cheesemakers hit by hospitality shutdown and helping free school meal families in one fell swoop. pic.twitter.com/l9bITJ2jQ7— Jack Montgomery (@JackBMontgomery) February 11, 2021With nowhere else for the milk to go, the farmers may be forced to accept even lower prices for their daily fresh produce — a disaster given how dangerously low milk prices have already been driven by greedy supermarkets — or even left to simply throw fresh milk down the drain.Meanwhile, possibly through carelessness, incompetence, or corruption — all accusations that have lately been levelled at the government — the Conservative government in the United Kingdom burned some goodwill with its so-called food parcels programme.The initiative saw food given directly to parents as a replacement for the free meals entitlement usually given to disadvantaged children at school. The problem was, while the government was being charged £30 a bundle by suppliers, the meagre actual contents were worth a fraction of that.Is there a solution for these woes? There is a long — and slightly bewildering — history of so-called government cheese. In the United States, the government had given hard-pressed dairy farmers a hand-up during times of price collapse in the 20th century by bulk-buying milk and turning it into a standardised long-life cheese, as well as other products. While this was a sort of Cold War strategic reserve, tens of thousands of tons of cheese were ultimately distributed to low-income and otherwise vulnerable U.S. citizens by President Ronald Reagan.Certainly, this is not the normal approach of Britain’s Conservatives. Then again, neither is having half the nation on government benefits, placing the country under house arrest, or 10-year jail sentences for fibbing about going on holiday.As Marie Antoinette didn’t say, let them eat artisanal English cheeses. It’s only going to go in the bin, otherwise.

953,"Greater Manchester Police was alerted six months before the Manchester Arena suicide bombing to the deficiencies in its terror attack response plans, the public inquiry into the Islamist attack has heard.The ongoing inquiry heard on Monday that the police inspectorate handed a “hot brief” to GMP’s then Assistant Chief Constable Catherine Hankinson, the force’s lead on counter-terrorism, in November 2016 when the UK’s threat level was at its highest, severe.The report, part of a national review, had said that GMP had put too much responsibility on its force duty officers (FDO) to lead when responding to a terror attack involving armed terrorists and they could become overwhelmed, according to The Guardian.In it, several FDOs were reported to have said they “felt ill-equipped” to deal with a terrorism incident and wanted more training.One unnamed officer was recorded as saying: “I get two days on how to command vehicle pursuit and approximately one to two hours in MTFA [marauding terrorist firearms incident].”“There is no question that the FDO is being overloaded with tasks in the initial stages of a potential [Operation Plato] and will require urgent help,” the report had said.Operation Plato designates areas where only trained firearms officers could go during a marauding terror attack.The details of how the force would have failed in its response to an armed terrorist incident are pertinent to the review on the suicide attack, because following initial, erroneous, reports of gunshot victims on the night of May 22nd, 2017, Manchester police had mistakenly believed the suicide bombing was a shooting and that there was an active terrorist gunman on scene.Manchester Arena Operators Accused of Putting Profits Above Lives Before Ariana Grande Terror Attack https://t.co/SdquT7eFxK— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 27, 2021As a result, force duty officer Inspector Dale Sexton triggered Operation Plato. As well as setting out the rules for sending in tactical armed officers, Operation Plato also determined when emergency services could enter the building. The enquiry heard that there was only one paramedic in the foyer for the first 40 minutes after the terror blast, with the first firetruck arriving more than two hours later.Policing experts claimed that that the FDO had become overwhelmed when put in charge of what he thought was a shooting terror attack, but what was soon revealed to be a suicide bombing. The son of Libyan refugees Salman Abedi detonated his backpack bomb stuffed with explosives and shrapnel with the intention of killing as many of the mostly women, young girls, and families as possible at the Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena. The Islamist terror attack claimed the lives of 22, the youngest just eight years old, and injured hundreds of others.Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services’ associate inspector, Andrew Buchan, told the inquiry that GMP had placed too much of a burden of responsibility on its FDOs to lead in the event of a terror attack.UK: 8-year-old Islamic Terror Bombing Victim Could Have Survived with Better Care https://t.co/LkVeKJ81wm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 18, 2021The report also found a general lack of knowledge of terror response plans amongst its unarmed officers and control room staff, many saying they would not have known what to do in the event of an attack.Months of the ongoing inquiry in Manchester has shown massive failures by all branches of authority, including MI5 which was aware than Abedi, who had been on the Security Service’s radar since 2010, was in contact with known extremists leading up to the terror attack but did not act upon the intelligence.There were also failings by British Transport Police and the Community Support Officers unit on the night of the attack, including holes in staffing and surveilling of the building and environs, leading to Abedi entering the building without being searched despite carrying a suspicious-looking backpack into a concert hall.While the venue’s security guards brushed off members of the public’s concerns over the strange behaviour of Abedi — who at one point was seen praying in the foyer — for fear of being considered a “racist”.Fingerprints of Ariana Grande Bomber's Refugee Father Found in Car That Stored Explosives https://t.co/lD8x6Xe2ti— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 7, 2020Law and OrderLondon / Europe2017 Manchester terror attackIslamist terrorismManchester Arenamanchester attackPoliceSalman AbediUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
954,"Nigel Farage announced on Saturday night that he would be stepping away from electoral politics and standing down as the leader of the Reform UK party, but vowed to continue his fights against the increasing influence of Communist China in Britain and the woke agenda sweeping the West.Just over two months after the United Kingdom’s genuine departure from the European Union, ‘Mr Brexit’ has declared that his fight in electoral politics are over. Former Brexit Party MEP Richard Tice will be taking over as the leader of Reform UK.Speaking with The Telegraph, Mr Farage declared: “there is no going back — Brexit is done. That won’t be reversed. I know I’ve come back once or twice when people thought I’d gone, but this is it. It’s done. It’s over.”“Now’s the moment for me to say I’ve knocked on my last door. I’m going to step down as the leader of Reform UK. I’ll have no executive position at all. I’m quite happy to have an honorary one, but party politics, campaigning, being involved in elections, that is now over for me because I’ve achieved the one thing I set out to do: to achieve the independence of the UK,” Farage proclaimed.“Brexit was a grassroots rebellion and it was my honour to lead those grassroots. Without a single person of real influence in this country advocating leaving the EU, we still got to the stage when a referendum was called. And that is a remarkable thing,” he said.Following the initial victory of the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Farage stepped down as the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), saying “I want my life back”.Mr Farage would be thrust back into electoral politics in 2019, however, with the formation of the Brexit Party, amid fears that the Westminster establishment would overturn the results of the referendum.The party achieved success in its first election, dominating the European Parliament elections and winning 29 seats, the most of any party. The humiliating defeat for the ruling Conservative Party ultimately foreshadowed the downfall of anti-Brexit former prime minister Theresa May.In an address given on his YouTube channel, Mr Farage said that had he not launched the Brexit Party, he believes the United Kingdom would not have left the European Union.Farage: Brexit a Victory for Grassroots Campaigning and British Democracy https://t.co/edt1DP72kW— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 29, 2020The Brexit leader said that while he is stepping away from the grind of electoral politics, he has no intentions of retiring from the political sphere altogether.Mr Farage said that there are “lots of other things that I want to fight for and campaign for, in particular, the increasing influence of the Chinese Communist Party over our whole way of life and once again the British establishment effectively have sold out to it.”In January, the Brexit leader said that with the completion of Brexit, his next campaign would be to end Britain’s reliance on the Chinese dictatorship. Mr Farage said that the CCP represents an “even bigger challenge” and a “bigger threat to our independence, our way of life,” than the European Union.Mr Farage also pointed to the “woke agenda” being pushed by the education establishment in Britain, which he said is teaching children as young as seven-years-old to “hate this country”, adding that pupils and students are not being taught critical thinking but instead are being “propagandised politically”.He also said that he plans to continue his work on social media, in particular on YouTube, where over the past year he has worked to expose the growing migrant crisis in the English Channel and the bungled response from the notionally conservative Tory government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“I have built up over these years quite a considerable social media platform. I’ve got reach. So I want to go on influencing the debate. I want to go on changing debate.

955,"Nearly 300 illegal migrants have successfully landed in the United Kingdom after crossing the English Channel from France this year, despite the Brexit promise to ‘take back control’ of the country’s borders.Over the weekend, the UK’s Border Force brought ashore five small rubber boats carrying a total of 92 illegals. Authorities in France prevented an additional 92 migrants from crossing the Channel.An analysis of English Channel crossings has found that 285 illegal aliens have landed on British shores since the official departure from the European Union, the Daily Mail reported.The Minister for Immigration Compliance Chris Philp said: “The Government continues to undertake substantial measures to tackle this unacceptable problem of illegal migration.“In January we introduced new rules which mean we can treat asylum claims as inadmissible if they have travelled through safe countries to get to the UK.“These crossings are illegal which is why we are pursuing the criminals behind these crossings, returning migrants who have no right to stay in the UK to safe countries and will continue to do everything we can to make this route unviable.”Boris Shuts All Travel Corridors, But Migrant Boats Keep on Coming https://t.co/IaroRlhONt— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 17, 2021Last week, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that the government intends to publish a policy paper within the next two weeks, outlining plans to crack down on the illegal people smuggling trade that facilitates the “plague” of illegal crossings.Patel said that later this year, the government would seek to pass a Sovereign Borders Bill which will place limitations on “litigious” human rights claimants trying to skirt deportation.Alleged asylum seekers will also be required to present all their refugee qualifications at the outset of their application, rather than adding last-minute claims as a basis for additional legal challenges.The home secretary also is reportedly considering lowering the bar for foreign criminals to be deported, with those serving six-month prison sentences being subject to removal from the country for the first time.It never stops. https://t.co/hxPrVhvCpH— Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 5, 2021It is unclear how this will be implemented, however, as the British government has so far failed to secure a deal with the European Union — or indeed any individual member state — on the matter of deportations.Last year, the number of deportations carried out by the Home Office fell by over 4,000 over the previous year, representing a 79 per cent drop. Officials blamed the coronavirus crisis for the dramatic decline.The government has also failed to demonstrate any willingness to take the unilateral step of simply immediately returning migrants caught at sea, like the wildly successful Operation Sovereign Borders strategy adopted in Australia under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott.In 2020, over 8,400 illegal migrants were recorded to have crossed the English Channel from France, over four times as many as came the year before.Take Back Control? 2020 Saw the Europe Migrant Crisis Land on British Shores https://t.co/q3AaPkMbFl— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 28, 2020Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here @KurtZindulkaImmigrationLondon / EuropeBoat MigrantsBorder Crisisborder securityChannel MigrantsChris PhilpdiversityEurope Migrant Crisishome officeIllegal Immigrantsillegal immigrationMass MigrationMigrant Crisispriti patelUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

958,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has admitted that the European Union was at fault for the delays to rolling out vaccines to European citizens, after last week acknowledging that countries acting alone, like Britain, are “speedboats” compared to the EU.In her public admission of the EU’s faulty coronavirus vaccine strategy, where Brussels demanded to be in charge of procurement for the whole bloc, Mrs von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday that “today we are not where we want to be in combating the virus.“We were late in granting authorisation. We were too optimistic about mass production. And maybe we also took for granted that the doses ordered would actually arrive on time. We must ask ourselves why, and what lessons we can draw from it.”However, the chief eurocrat stood by the EU plan — saying that “it was right – and is right – that we Europeans ordered our vaccine jointly” — and implied that while all Europeans would be receiving their vaccines later than many other countries around the world, they would at least be vaccinated later, together, “in a spirit of solidarity”.Commission President von der Leyen also displayed a lack of faith in the generosity of member states, suggesting that some would hoard their doses in their event of vaccine success whilst others failed.“I don’t even want to imagine what it would have meant if some large Member States had secured the vaccine while the rest went empty-handed. What would that have meant for our internal market, and for European unity? It would have made no economic sense. And it would have meant the end of our Community,” she said.Reports from last summer, however, contradict the notion that the richer nations sourcing their own contracts would leave their neighbours high and dry.Chief Eurocrat Complains Countries Treating Vaccine Development Like a ‘Space Race’ https://t.co/dKAFmKN3zt— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 8, 2021The Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and France, forming the Inclusive Vaccines Alliance (IVA), had made a preliminary agreement on a vaccine production deal with AstraZeneca in June, with the company’s CEO Pascal Soriot telling journalists at the time that the four leading nations of the bloc would “work together with the European Commission and other countries in Europe to ensure everybody across Europe is supplied with the vaccine”.Further, a source from Italy’s health department told Reuters at the time that not only would the doses be available for all EU member states who are able to join the scheme, but that the four countries would front the initial costs. AstraZeneca has also maintained that it is not making a profit from coronavirus vaccines.Later reports revealed that the process began to fall apart when the European Commission demanded to take over the procurement from the IVA.

959,"Two paedophiles have received short prison sentences after hunting for girls as young as ten in Birmingham, England.64-year-old Abdi Shire, 64, of Small Heath, and 24-year-old Adean Ahmed, of Edgbaston, were snared by West Midlands Police officers who are “active on social media, instant messaging apps and other online platforms looking for people seeking to groom children online”.The paedophiles had travelled to try and meet underage girls for sex, according to a West Midlands Police news bulletin, with Ahmed having asked “do you have any 12” and “is there anything like 10” as he attempted to pay for a victim.Birmingham Crown Court saw fit to impose a sentence of just three years and two months on Shire, and three years on Ahmed — with the likelihood being that they will be automatically released on licence much earlier than that, as most criminal sentenced to non-“life” sentences are entitled to early release halfway or, more rarely, two-thirds of the way through their terms under Labour era legislation the governing Conservatives have left largely unchanged.'Asian' Rape Gang Leader Released Just Eight Years Into 26-Year Term https://t.co/aADbLh8jBi— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 20, 2020“We’ve delivered swift justice against these two men,” said Detective Inspector Lewis Cook, for the West Midlands Police Force Priorities and Vulnerabilities Team, claiming their short custodial terms were “significant prison sentences”.“Both men had clear intentions to meet and abuse girls – and in Ahmed’s case he enquired about girls as young as 10,” the officer continued.“Vigilante ‘paedophile hunter’ groups have emerged in recent times and there seems to be a perception police are not doing this work − but that’s absolutely not the case,” he added defensively, referring to groups such as the Guardians of the North which work to catch paedophiles trying to groom children online.Well over half of the prosecutions against people attempting to meet a child following sexual grooming used evidence gathered by such groups in 2018, according to the BBC — but the police, who have been widely criticised for systemic failures on child grooming, are often resentful of them, accusing them of “acting in their own interests”.Grooming Gangs Whistleblower: Police Who Turned Blind Eye to Abuse Must Be Prosecuted https://t.co/lT5dyusiFM— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 18, 2020CrimeImmigrationLondon / EuropeBirminghamBritainBritish policechild abuseChild AbusersChild Groomingchild molestersGroomingMass MigrationPaedophilesSoft SentencesUnited KingdomvigilantesWest Midlands Police.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

961,"Former British Supreme Court Justice Lord Jonathan Sumption has branded lockdowns “thoroughly inhumane”, saying the policy comes at a “cost” of the misery of millions of people.Last week, reports suggested that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak was concerned that government scientists had been “moving the goalposts” for the criteria for ending lockdown, from hospitalisations, to vaccinations, to case numbers.Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who now chairs the government’s health committee, wants restrictions to remain in place until cases fall to 1,000 a day.Lord Sumption, a vocal lockdown critic, told LBC radio on Monday that Mr Hunt’s suggestion was an “absurdity”.“We can’t have zero COVID,” said the former Supreme Court justice, who has compared police overreach in enforcing lockdown laws to a “police state”.Continuing, he remarked: “There have only been two cases in which infectious disease has been eradicated entirely, or virtually entirely. Smallpox took two centuries after the invention of a totally effective vaccine to disappear.“Simply saying that we want to eliminate the virus altogether or reduce it below 1,000 cases is, I think, a completely unbalanced and fanatical approach.”He added: “The cost of this has got to be remembered. Not just the cost in economic terms, but in human terms.”Sumption then outlined the story of one woman who suffered a stroke and then caught coronavirus in hospital, dying at the age of 74 in isolation. “Her life should have been full of joy, of grandchildren, of meeting people, and of stimulation. Instead of which, her last year was spent in utter wretchedness and misery, isolated from everything. Alone.“That is an inhuman story. It’s been repeated millions of times around the country.”Britain Is Turning Into a Totalitarian Police State, Warns Top Lawyer Lord Sumption https://t.co/pLAKQoAYaT— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 30, 2020Reports circulated last year of elderly Britons in care homes being denied contact with their loved ones over the risk of transmission of coronavirus, with many seniors begging for restrictions be lifted so they could be with their families.Sumption said: “The policy of lockdown is a thoroughly inhumane policy which is due to one-track minds that can only think about deaths and not about life.”Last month, the former senior judge warned of the costs to lockdown — not just economic, but social and educational, saying: “We are in the process of turning a public health crisis into an economic, social, and educational disaster.”There has been a rise in reported cases of youth mental health issues since the beginning of the pandemic, with one doctor describing that before coronavirus children in mental health crises were arriving at his Accident and Emergency unit once or twice a week; now, that was once or twice a day. Alcohol-related deaths have also risen to the highest figures in recorded history.Lord Sumption also dismissed the suggestion that new strains of the novel coronavirus should influence whether the country should remain in lockdown, telling LBC host Nick Ferrari: “Variants have always been a problem about viruses.“They spontaneously mutate…and we’re not just concerned with the South African variant. There will be many other variants.“Unless we lock ourselves down forever, this is something we are simply going to have to live with.”Retired Supreme Court Justice Brands Lockdowns 'Useless', 'Immoral' https://t.co/ZR8MrMruKY— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 19, 2020HealthLondon / EuropeSciencecoronavirusCOVID-19lockdownLord SumptionpandemicUnited Kingdom.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

963,"PARIS (AP) – France’s government wants to set the age of sexual consent at 15 and make it easier to punish long-ago child sexual abuse, amid growing public pressure and a wave of online testimonies about rape and other sexual violence by parents and authority figures.Child protection activists and victims celebrated the announcement, but say France needs to do more as a society to stop this abuse.France’s lack of an age of consent – along with statutes of limitations – have complicated efforts to prosecute alleged perpetrators, including recent cases involving a prominent modeling agent, a predatory priest, a surgeon and a group of firefighters accused of systematic abuse.Calling such treatment of children “intolerable,” the justice ministry said “the government is determined to act quickly to implement the changes that our society expects.”“An act of sexual penetration by an adult on a minor under 15 will be considered a rape,” Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti said Tuesday on France-2 television. Perpetrators could no longer cite consent to diminish the charges, he said, though exceptions would be made for teenagers having consensual sex.The change still needs to be enshrined in law, but the announcement is a major step after years of efforts to toughen French protection for child victims of rape and other sexual violence.“Finally!” said Fatima Benomar, whose group Les Effrontees has pushed for tougher rules against sexual abusers of children. “It’s very good that there is this revived debate, that there is an idea of a minimum age (of consent). … This will make adults more responsible.”An effort to set France´s first age of consent three years ago in the wake of the global #MeToo movement failed amid legal complications. But it has gained new momentum since accusations emerged last month of incestuous sexual abuse involving a prominent French political expert, Olivier Duhamel. That unleashed an online #MeTooInceste movement in France that led to tens of thousands of similar testimonies.The Justice Ministry is in discussions with victims´ groups about toughening punishment of incestuous abuse and extending or abolishing the statute of limitations on sexual violence against children, because it creates such deep trauma that it can take decades for victims to speak out. The law currently allows child victims to file complaints until they are 48.The ministry also says it wants “to ensure that victims of the same perpetrator do not receive different legal treatment,” which could broaden the scope to prosecute those accused of abusing multiple people over decades.Arab World Institute Head Regrets Signing Letter Proposing Decriminalisation of Sex with Children https://t.co/uYJog1zzDr— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 19, 2021Legal time limits have hampered French authorities’ ability to investigate an influential cardinal, Philippe Barbarin, convicted then acquitted of covering up for a predatory priest; modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, an associate of disgraced late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, accused of an array of sex crimes; and surgeon Joel le Scouarnec, convicted after accusations he sexually abused more than 300 children over decades, as well as other less-prominent cases.France’s highest court was considering a case Wednesday involving a woman who says multiple firefighters raped her when she was between 13 and 15. A lower court downgraded the charges to sexual assault, but her lawyers want them reclassified as rape.Under current French law, sexual relations between an adult and a minor under 15 are banned. Yet the law accepts the possibility that someone under 15 is capable of consenting to sex, leading to cases where an adult is only prosecuted for sexual assault instead of rape, and faces a lighter prison sentence.In the Duhamel case, the Paris prosecutor opened an investigation into alleged “rapes and sexual abuses by a person exercising authority” over a child following accusations in a book by his stepdaughter that he abused her twin brother in the 1980s, when the siblings were in their early teens.Duhamel, saying he was “the target of personal attacks,” stepped down from his many professional positions, including as a TV commentator and head of National Foundation of Political Sciences. The foundation manages the prestigious Sciences Po university in Paris, whose director Frederic Mion resigned this week amid the fallout from the affair, which entangled multiple people in France’s intellectual elite.Since the Duhamel accusations surfaced, searing accounts of alleged incestuous abuse filled social media networks. Other prominent figures in cinema and politics have also been accused. The movement spawned an offshoot #MeTooGay wave in France of long-suppressed testimonies of sexual abuse by older men.Activists say improving laws is part of the battle, but they also are pushing for more child-centered public policies to train teachers and others to spot and report abuse.The World Health Organization says international studies show that one in five women and one in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child.One-Third of Young Prostitutes in Paris No-Go Suburbs Under 15-Years-Old https://t.co/XGzxmt0n7z— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 13, 2019CrimeLondon / EuropeAge of Consentchild abuseChild Rapechild sex crimeschild sexual abusechild sexual exploitationFrance.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
964,"Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of Google-owned YouTube, said on Thursday that former President Donald Trump’s account on the platform will remain blacklisted until the “risk of violence has decreased,” adding that Trump’s channel could be permanently banned if he continues to violate the site’s policies after being unsuspended in the future.Wojcicki said that the decision to suspend Trump’s YouTube account was made after the Capitol Hill riot on January 6, when the company reviewed the president’s account and found content that it believed was in violation of the site’s “incitement to violence” policy. Her comments came during an Atlantic Council event.“As a result, we removed those videos very quickly, and when we see a violation of our policy, we suspend the channel for seven days,” said Wojcicki during an Atlantic Council forum on Thursday.“Now, it’s a minimum of seven days,” added the YouTube CEO. “The channel remains suspended due to the risk of incitement to violence.”LIVE—A #ACFrontPage event with @YouTube CEO @SusanWojcicki on #disinformation and internet policy https://t.co/leDqJi1KoO— Atlantic Council (@AtlanticCouncil) March 4, 2021“Given just the warnings by the Capitol police yesterday about a potential attack today, I think it’s pretty clear that that elevated violence risk still remains,” added Wojcicki.The Capitol police were reportedly worried of “a possible plot to breach the Capitol by an identified militia group” on March 4. No such activity, however, ended up occuring.“I do want to confirm that we will lift the suspension of the channel,” Wojcicki continued. “We will lift the suspension of the Donald Trump channel when we determine that the risk of violence has decreased.”The YouTube CEO went on to suggest that Trump’s suspension eventually being lifted is no guarantee that the former president will get to remain on the platform indefinitely.“But when the channel is reinstated, it will be subject to the same policies that every other channel follows,” said Wojcicki.“If we see content that is uploaded that in any way violates any of our policies — incitement to violence or any kind of election integrity policy violations — then a second strike will be issued, and when there are three strikes within a 90-day period, then the channel is removed,” added the YouTube CEO.When asked how YouTube will measure the so-called “danger” being reduced, Wojcicki said that the company will look toward the government for answers.“The way we would determine whether or not that risk of violence has decreased — is by looking at government statements, government warnings,” said Wojcicki.“We certainly would look at increased law enforcement around the country,” added the YouTube CEO. “We also would look at any kind of violent rhetoric that we see on our platform.”“But there still is that elevated risk of violence,” affirmed Wojcicki of the danger level as of Thursday.On Thursday, YouTube blacklisted Trump’s speech at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and gave the Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN) a two-week suspension from YouTube because it covered the former president’s speech.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, on Parler @alana, and on Instagram.EconomyPoliticsTechAtlantic CouncilDonald TrumpFree Speech OnlineGoogleMasters of the UniverseSusan WojcickiYouTube.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

966,"The student body president of the University of Connecticut (UConn) has fallen under fire by his peers in student government over his support of pro-free speech legislation on campus.The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) Governing Board recently issued a “vote of no confidence” for student body president Mike Hernández over his support of a proposed free speech bill, according to a report by Daily Campus.The legislation in questions seeks to protect the right of students to freely express their opinions within student government and at the university as a whole.This concept, however, is facing backlash on campus, as other USG members believe the legislation will give students “a free pass to express casual racism, homophobia and misogyny without consequence,” the report added.“Over the past several weeks, President Hernández has acted in a manner unbecoming of the office he holds, which has manifested in an apparent inability to understand the impact that his actions have and a disregard for the concerns repeatedly brought to him by those he leads,” said UConn’s USG in a statement.A post shared by UConn USG (@usguconn)Hernández has reportedly also been facing backlash after a private comment he made to a fellow student came to light, in which the student body president likened the legislation to treating minorities like children.“We specifically reject the assertion that protecting minorities is akin to treating them like children,” continued USG in its statement “We reaffirm our sentiment that the best way to promote inclusion is to condemn racism, antisemitism, sexism, and all other forms of bias and discrimination.”Brittany Diaz — a candidate for the upcoming chief diversity officer election, as well as one of Hernández’s critics — expressed her approval of USG’s recent vote of no confidence for the student body president.“I believe it is the responsibility of the student government to hold our president accountable,” said Diaz. “This was long overdue but much needed. I am happy to see that a statement was released.”This is not the first time Hernández has been attacked by his peers after expressing benign views.Last month, the student body president was accused of supporting “white supremacy” after vetoing a resolution that called on the university to defund the campus police.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, on Parler @alana, and on Instagram.EducationSocial JusticeTechAcademic InsanityFree Speech on CampusUConn.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
967,"Freedom of speech on the internet did not lead to a rise in “hate crimes,” according to a report sent from the U.S. Department of Commerce to Congress in January — a report that has yet to appear on any government website.Breitbart News has obtained a copy of the report, which is published in full below. But sources close to the government say they are baffled as to why it wasn’t released publicly after being sent to Congress.The report was prepared by the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which is responsible for advising the President on all matters related to telecommunication and the internet.It was drafted to revise the findings of a previous report from NTIA in 1993 titled The Role of Telecommunications in Hate Crimes. Although it was prepared under the Trump administration, the request to revise the report came from the 116th Congress, which was controlled by a 35-seat Democrat majority in the House and only a slim Republican majority in the Senate.The 1993 report is still publicly available on the web. But the latest revision to its findings is not.Sources who were close to the drafting and approval process suspect that bureaucrats and establishment politicians with a vested interest in the “hate crimes” panic are trying to suppress it, because its conclusions challenge popular media narratives alleging a rise in internet-inspired hate crimes.“Reports like this are typically made public,” said a source who worked closely with the NTIA on the report. “I don’t know why this report isn’t up on a government website yet. It’s already been submitted to Congress, it’s not a private thing anymore. I suspect the Civil Rights Division might have something to do with it.”According to the source, who formerly worked in the Trump administration, the updated report was bitterly opposed by the Civil Rights Division, which is the part of the DoJ responsible for prosecuting hate crimes.The Civil Rights Division, said the source, is also at the forefront of “efforts to drum up hysteria” over white nationalist extremism in the U.S. Despite its opposition, however, the report was approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and sent to Congress.But the report does not publicly appear on any website. No one in Congress has mentioned it. And the press has not reported on its findings — until now.READ THE FULL REPORT HERE.
 The report bluntly states that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between the growth in internet usage and hate crimes, pointing out that there is not even any correlation, as media allegations about a surge in hate crimes over the past five years are not supported by the Justice Department’s crime statistics.From the report:The evidence does not show that during last decade, a time of expansive growth of electronic communications, particularly on the Internet and mobile devices as well as social media, there has been a rise in hate crime incidents. [emphasis ours]The report also warns that efforts to clamp down on online communications over unfounded concerns about “hate crimes” will undermine First Amendment values.From the report:We caution that efforts to control or monitor online speech, even for the worthy goal of reducing crime, present serious First Amendment concerns and runs counter to our nation’s dedication to free expression. To quote President Barack Obama, “The strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression; it is more speech.”The report also criticizes academic “extremism” researchers for failing to back up their assertions of a causal link between online hate speech and real-world hate crime.From the report:…this research, and much like it, fails to demonstrate any causal relationship between increased social media use and increased violence.  This research does not present even comprehensive descriptive data correlating increased hate speech on social media with increased hate crimes.Finally, the report issues a blistering condemnation of Silicon Valley companies for using the “hate speech” panic to undermine freedom of expression on their platforms.From the report:Clay Neff reported that tech leaders have recognized that relying on human teams alone to review content will not be enough and that artificial intelligence will have to play a significant role.  That said, there are, of course, significant policy and practical limitations to reliance on automated content moderation. Interestingly, much of this technology is being developed from approaches pioneered by the Chinese Communist Party to stifle political discussion and dissent.Given that all the major social media platforms have rules against hate speech and, in fact, employ sophisticated algorithmic artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to enforce these often vague and contradictory rules in a manner also used by tyrannous regimes, it is appropriate to ask what they gain from it.  Certainly, as this Report shows, the platforms have no reasonable expectation that their censorship will end hate crimes or even diminish it, as no empirical evidence exists linking increased hate speech with hate crimes.Further, this censorship poses real dangers to our political system.  Under the hate speech prohibitions and other censorship rules, the platforms have removed content that many consider seriously engaged with pressing political and social issues.Breitbart News has reached out to the NTIA and the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division for comment.Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News. He is the author of #DELETED: Big Tech’s Battle to Erase the Trump Movement and Steal The Election.PoliticsSocial JusticeTechDepartment of CommerceDonald TrumpFree Speech OnlineNTIAOn the Hillonline hate speech.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"

Censorship against women needs to end!!! I’ll never stop fighting against this bull%h*t. Stay tuned. pic.twitter.com/nP83krKSMM— BITCHIMBELLATHORNE (@bellathorne) February 23, 2021But when YouTube reinstated her music video, the company placed an age-restriction on it, followed by a “shocking restriction,” according to Thorne, who added that this action essentially marks her music video as “explicit,” which limits users from easily accessing the video through online search.“They’re saying the video is ‘so shocking’ that I’m making out with this girl,” Thorne said. “Can we talk about how ridiculous this is? There’s no nudity in the video. We’re doing a hip-hop routine and making out. This is so explicit to the world that the world can’t see it.”Throne said the restrictions have since been lifted.Watch Below:The actress added, however, that she is now worried about the power that big tech has, and wants to see a reform of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives liability protections for Big Tech platforms on the Internet.“All of Big Tech is guilty,” Thorne said. “They have so much power and they’re also not using their power in the right way. Put your power where it actually makes a difference.”Thorne said while these social media companies police certain content, they are not being held accountable for dangerous content, such as footage of obscene violence, as well bullying on message boards and in comments sections.“There are threads on the Internet featuring people telling someone to ‘go kill yourself.’ You can go on the Internet and find someone’s brain being smashed in,” Throne said. “The Internet is a dark a — place and Big Tech is focusing on the wrong things. You have all of these problems in front of you that they could fix, and they don’t.”“The message that they’re sending is that they are God, and they will decide what you’re going to do,” the actress added. “They’re going to decide your career, they get to decide if your fans see this video or not. They get to decide if they see your art. That is unfair.”Bella Thorne says that she believes the situation will change if the narrative changes.“I think it’ll really change the narrative if people get involved. Of course, what my fans did was so helpful. But this is a bigger debate,” Throne said. “What about the millions of kids who have killed themselves after being bullied on your platform publicly for the whole world to see?”“How come Big Tech isn’t taking a harsh — look at their own standards and putting them directly in focus with how they are hurting communities?” Thorne added. “Where’s the liability?”You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, on Parler @alana, and on Instagram.EntertainmentTechBella ThorneBig TechCensorshipYouTube.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
971,"A coalition of students at the University of Michigan (UMich) called the “Students of Color Liberation Front” is demanding that the school end all university-sponsored trips to Israel, along with replacing Sabra hummus in the cafeteria with an “Arab-owned brand.” Additionally, the students demand to work towards a  “police-free campus.”“We, the Students of Color Liberation Front, unwavering in our commitment to liberate all peoples on campus, call for the University of Michigan to realize our collective demands,” states the coalition at the beginning of its statement, titled, “Anti-Racist Demands.”The statement goes on to say that the university “cannot expect to foster an equitable, inclusive, and diverse campus community and environment while continuing to provide financial support to harmful and exclusionary institutions.”“Rather than be purely profit-driven, the University’s investments must be built upon ethical and moral considerations for sustainable investment,” the statement adds.Among the demands include a call on the university to remove “Sabra hummus from dining halls/campus shops and replace with locally sourced, Arab-owned brand,” and “end the Central Student Government’s trip to Israel/all University-sponsored trips to Israel.”The coalition is also demanding that the university “cultivate a safe campus climate” for students by cutting all ties with the Ann Arbor Police Department in order to work toward a “police-free campus.”“In order to minimize police interactions on campus, we have drafted the following list of non-negotiable action items for the University of Michigan to implement widely as on-campus policies,” says the coalition in its statement.“These action items will cultivate a safe campus climate for all students, especially Black and Brown students who are disproportionately placed at risk when the University relies heavily on police presence on campus,” the statement adds.From there, the coalition demands that UMich “cut ALL ties” with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Ann Arbor Police Department, as well as “disarm” the university’s Division of Public Safety and Security.Among its demands, the coalition is also calling on the university to “reassess the ways Palestine is taught and represented” in curriculum, and to establish a Palestine Studies Scholar/Chair who “will be consulted about how Palestinians are portrayed in curriculum not taught by a Palestinian/Arab professor.”“And a deliberate effort will be made to include and uplift Palestinian narratives in these cases,” the coalition adds.The Students of Color Liberation Front is a coalition made up of the Black Student Union, the United Asian American Organizations, La Casa, the Arab Student Association, Students Allied for Freedom and Equality (SAFE), the Native American Student Association, and the Student Community of Progressive Empowerment.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, on Parler @alana, and on Instagram.EducationIsrael / Middle EastTechAcademic InsanityBDSDefund the PoliceIsraelPalestinian AuthoritySabraUniversity of Michigan.Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.Copyright © 2021 Breitbart"
972,"Brave, the privacy-focused web browser, is currently preparing to launch its own search engine for desktop and mobile users, according to recent reports. The company’s goal is to offer a complete package of browsing and search untouchable by the Masters of the Universe.TechCrunch reports that Brave, the privacy-focused browser co-founded by former Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, is preparing to launch its own search engine. Last week Brave announced the acquisition of an open-source search engine developed by the team behind the Cliqz anti-tracking search-browser combo.The newly acquired tech will support the new Brave Search engine, meaning that soon Brave will be promoting a search and browsing experience to its users that is entirely free of Big Tech’s influence.In a press release, Brave states: “Under the hood, nearly all of today’s search engines are either built by, or rely on, results from Big Tech companies. In contrast, the Tailcat search engine is built on top of a completely independent index, capable of delivering the quality people expect but without compromising their privacy. Tailcat does not collect IP addresses or use personally identifiable information to improve search results.”Cliqz, a privacy-focused European fork of the Firefox browser, shut down last May after its main investor, Hubert Burda Media, called an end to the firm’s efforts to offer an alternative to Google. Members of the former Cliqz development team, who had been working on Tailcat, are moving to Brave as part of the acquisition.Eich told TechCrunch:Tailcat is a fully independent search engine with its own search index built from scratch. Tailcat as Brave Search will offer the same privacy guarantees that Brave has in its browser.Brave will provide the first private browser+search alternative to the Big Tech platforms, and will make it seamless for users to browse and search with guaranteed privacy. Also, owing to its transparent nature, Brave Search will address algorithmic biases and prevent outright censorship.Read more at TechCrunch here.Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
