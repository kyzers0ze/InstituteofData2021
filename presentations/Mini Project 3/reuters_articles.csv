0,"Google to review adverts for Myanmar military-backed telecoms firm
Google said on Wednesday it is reviewing recent advertisements run by a Myanmar military-backed telecommunications firm and has disabled some army-linked accounts on its services in the wake of the country's coup.

YouTube is owned by Alphabet Inc, the parent company of Google.Justice for Myanmar, an advocacy group looking at the army’s business interests, said on Wednesday it had found that Google and Rakuten-owned messaging app Viber were running new advertisements for Mytel, a Myanmar telecoms partially owned by the army, following a ban by Facebook.Mytel, Viber and Rakuten did not respond to requests for comment.Justice for Myanmar representative Yadanar Maung said while the group welcomed Google’s recent steps to disable some military-linked accounts on its platforms, it was “appalled” if Google and Viber profited by selling advertisements for “the Myanmar military business” Mytel.Reuters reviewed three Mytel advertisements published on Google and Viber over the last week, soon after Facebook announced it would block the Myanmar army from access to its platforms as well as advertising by all army-linked military entities. [L4N2KV19W]Vietnamese operator Viettel, which is partly owned by Vietnam’s ministry of defence, is also a backer of Mytel.Viettel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Facebook in 2020 removed more than a dozen user accounts and pages for “coordinated inauthentic behaviour”, which it said were being used to covertly promote Mytel and disparage rivals.Documents published by Justice for Myanmar, whose website has been blocked by authorities in Myanmar, found that Mytel is under large control of the Myanmar military, for which it provides a significant source of income.“The military’s business interests help finance the brutal atrocities they are committing against the people of Myanmar,” said Maung, who called on technology firms to ban all military businesses from its platforms.",Reuters

Only around 6.4% of the 83 million population have received at least a first dose against the coronavirus, far behind countries like Britain, Israel and the United StatesSpahn said the rate would increase from April, when family doctors will be able to administer doses at their surgeries.“But the vaccination numbers will not immediately grow to 20 million a month or to 10 million a week,” he told ZDF television. “In April there will be significantly more vaccinations, but not on that scale” he added.The head of the KBV doctors’ association said surgeries could administer about 5 million vaccinations a week and urged the government to let them get on with it.“Just let us vaccinate, make the vaccine available to us through pharmacies and don’t kill us with bureaucracy,” said Andreas Gassen.Germany has started to ease some lockdown restrictions even though infections are rising again. By Wednesday, the number of coronavirus cases had risen to more than 2.5 million. More than 72,000 people have died.",Reuters

4,"South Korean hospitals extract extra COVID vaccine doses from vials
In a handful of South Korean hospitals, designated nurses are using specially designed syringes to squeeze extra doses of coronavirus vaccine out of each vial in a bid to stretch the still limited number of vials to cover more people.
4:03AM EST",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea-vaccine/south-korean-hospitals-extract-extra-covid-vaccine-doses-from-vials-idUSKBN2B20P7,"SEOUL (Reuters) - In a handful of South Korean hospitals, designated nurses are using specially designed syringes to squeeze extra doses of coronavirus vaccine out of each vial in a bid to stretch the still limited number of vials to cover more people.The practice has raised debate over medical safety and commercial concerns from the manufacturers who charge by the dose.But at Seoul’s National Medical Center, healthcare workers say it’s actually a safe and easy process that should be a no-brainer for countries struggling to provide enough vaccines quickly.“Two designated nurses take shifts to extract the doses and each of us had no trouble getting seven doses from each vial, vaccinating everyone,” said Kim Eun-suk, an intravenous therapy specialist who was taking a shift extracting doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine from vials that officially only hold six.On Tuesday, Kim said the centre vaccinated 629 people with 90 vials of Pfizer vaccine co-developed by its German partner BioNTech, compared with the 540 people possible had they only extracted six doses from each vial.It takes about five minutes to extract the doses using “low dead space” syringes designed to minimise the residual volume, she said.“Extraction itself is not difficult. It requires squeezing the exact amount with the syringe. The most important is sterilization and I think any nurse would be able to pull through.”At the suggestion of frontline nurses, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said it was up to providers whether to use of remaining doses, but did not make it a new standard or mandatory because it said it could burden the healthcare workers on site.National Medical Center president Chung Ki-hyun said that the contracts with manufacturers - who sell by the dose - should not be a roadblock for on-site healthcare workers to use the remaining doses when they can save lives.“With care and precision, the extra dose isn’t as hard to extract,” he said.It’s not clear how many South Korean clinics are using the extra doses, but Chung said following the official limit means throwing away potentially life-saving vaccines.Experts were divided about the decision to extract extra doses, as pooling leftover vaccine from multiple vials can lead to contamination. With the specialised low dead space syringes, however, a full extra dose can typically be pulled from a single Pfizer vaccine vial, and as many as two extra doses from AstraZeneca’s vaccine vials.Urging caution over imprecise extraction, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) has advised its members to discard the remaining doses in the vials, according to a statement seen by Reuters.KDCA said 446,941 people were given first doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots by Tuesday midnight. South Korea has reported 470 new cases on Tuesday, adding to the total coronavirus cases of 93,733, with 1,648 deaths.",Reuters

South Korea has agreed to a 13.9% increase in its contribution to the cost of hosting some 28,500 U.S. troops for 2021, the biggest annual rise in nearly two decades after U.S. calls for greater funding.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump had accused South Korea of “free-riding” on U.S. military might and demanded that it pay as much as $5 billion a year.“The agreement resolved the longest-ever vacuum that had lasted about a year and three months,” South Korea’s chief negotiator, Jeong Eun-bo, told a televised briefing.“It provided a chance to reaffirm the importance of the alliance and the need for stable stationing of U.S. Forces Korea.”The six-year Special Measures Agreement with the United States came after drawn-out negotiations and will boost South Korea’s annual contribution to the bill for 2022 to 2025 in line with its annual defence budget increase, which was 5.4% this year, the foreign ministry said in a statement.The pact replaces an arrangement that expired at the end of 2019, under which South Korea paid about $920 million a year. Both sides agreed to freeze South Korea’s contribution for 2020, the ministry said.In the last big increase in its contribution, South Korea in 2003 paid 17% more than the previous year, according to data from a defence ministry white paper.On the new link between the contribution to the cost of maintaining U.S. forces and the defence budget, the ministry said the increase in the defence budget was a “reasonable, verifiable indicator” that reflected financial and security capabilities.But Shin Beom-chul, a security expert at the Research Institute for Economy and Society in Seoul, said aligning the two issues was a “mistake” for South Korea, one of the world’s largest defence spenders, and it could bring budget pressure.About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to help defend it against North Korea under a treaty of mutual defence signed after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.The treaty provided the basis for the stationing of U.S. forces in South Korea, which began paying towards their costs in the early 1990s after rebuilding its war-devastated economy.With negotiations making little headway after the last pact expired, about half of some 9,000 South Koreans working for the U.S. military were placed on unpaid leave, prompting the two sides to scramble for a stopgap deal to bring them back to work.Jeong said the accord stipulated that in future, workers can be get their existing salaries in the absence of a new deal.The workers’ union welcomed the agreement, saying it would help ensure stable work conditions. Without it, thousands more workers would have been forced to take unpaid leave next month, the union said.($1 = 1,140.8600 won)",Reuters

That included 49% of Republicans and 67% of Democrats, who were among 1,005 U.S. adults polled online March 3-4.McConnell, who entered the Senate in 1985 and served as Senate majority leader from 2015 until two months ago, has played a vital role in numerous Republican initiatives, including the cementing of a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.He was re-elected to a seventh term last November, with a victory margin of nearly 20 percentage points.Asked to comment on the polling data, a senior Senate Republican aide pointed to McConnell’s strong re-election last year and his record-long term as Senate Republican leader, a position he has held since 2007 without opposition.Most recently, he found himself at odds with Donald Trump after excoriating the former president on the Senate floor for his role in sparking the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.Despite his bipartisan lack of popularity, McConnell was still viewed favorably by 28% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats.But those numbers still left him well behind other Republican figures.Among other current Republican leaders, Trump remained the most popular among members of his own party: 74% of Republicans said they had a favorable view of the former president, while 24% said they had an unfavorable view.Sixty-nine percent of Republicans said they had a favorable view of former Vice President Mike Pence, 55% said they had a similar view of Republican Senator Ted Cruz and 23% had a favorable view of hard-right U.S. House Rep.

12,House Republicans may follow Democrats in rebooting shamed 'earmarks' game,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-republicans-earmarks/house-republicans-may-follow-democrats-in-rebooting-shamed-earmarks-game-idUSKBN2B2094,"(Reuters) - House Republicans are weighing whether to join Democrats in getting back into “earmarks” - the practice of loading spending bills with legislators’ pet projects - and a decision is expected this week, two sources familiar with the process said .The sources said House Republicans deliberated on the issue twice this week, and sentiment is growing toward embracing earmarks roughly a decade after the party decided to scrap the long-standing practice amid a raft of high-profile controversies. Democrats who control the House agreed to bring back earmarks this year.A move to participate in earmarks will draw criticism from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, which has long criticized the practice as wasteful. It may also signal that Republicans are willing to negotiate on U.S. President Joe Biden’s next major agenda item: a massive infrastructure package.Earmarks are considered legislative “sweeteners” that Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, can use to dissuade its members from defecting on major bills and attract votes from Republicans who otherwise would reject the measure.If Republicans agree to participate in earmarks, they are signaling they could be engaged on an infrastructure bill and may be willing to trade support if it means getting funding for popular projects in their districts.“It would certainly suggest members are preparing for talks around the budget and infrastructure,” said a source familiar with the discussions.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s office did not return calls and emails on Tuesday seeking comment.Earmarks became a hot campaign issue in the early 2000s after a long string of scandals in which lawmakers from both parties secured earmarks to enrich themselves.In 2005, Senator Ted Stevens inserted an earmark to build a $223 million bridge to connect Gravina Island in his home state of Alaska - population 50 - to the mainland. Quickly nicknamed the “bridge to nowhere,” it became a lightning rod for critics.Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham of California resigned and pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from military contractors for steering business their way, using his positions on military committees to insert earmarks. In 2006, Cunningham was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison for accepting $2.4 million in bribes.When Republicans took control of the House in 2011, they banned the practice. Urged by President Barack Obama, the Democratic Senate soon followed suit. Earmarks have been gone since.Democratic lawmakers announced earlier year that they were bringing back the practice, hoping it could solve a few issues, such as keeping their narrow majorities together on big votes, boosting vulnerable members’ reelection chances in 2022 and perhaps attracting Republican support.",Reuters

We will see how it goes,” Hathloul, 31, told reporters outside Riyadh’s Special Criminal Court before entering for a second session regarding her appeal.Hathloul, who championed women’s right to drive and for an end to Saudi’s male guardianship system, was detained in May 2018 and sentenced under broad cybercrime and counterterrorism laws in December to nearly six years in prison on charges that United Nations rights experts called spurious.The court suspended two years and 10 months of her sentence, most of which had already been served. Hathloul remains under a five-year travel ban.Hathloul rose to prominence in 2013 when she began publicly campaigning for women’s right to drive in Saudi Arabia.She was arrested for the first time in 2014 while attempting to drive across the border from the United Arab Emirates - where she had a valid driver’s licence - to Saudi Arabia.She spent 73 days in a women’s detention facility, an experience she later said helped shape her campaigning against the kingdom’s male guardianship system.U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which has taken a tough stance over Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, had urged Riyadh to release political prisoners including women’s rights activists.Saudi authorities released two activists with U.S. citizenship on bail in February pending trials on terrorism-related charges In January, a Saudi appeals court nearly halved a six-year prison sentence for a U.S.-Saudi physician and suspended the rest, meaning he did not have to return to jail.",Reuters

2:55AM EST",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-trace/englands-32-billion-covid-19-test-and-trace-not-making-a-difference-lawmakers-say-idUSKBN2B200D,"LONDON (Reuters) - England’s $32 billion test and trace system has not made a clear impact on the progress of COVID-19, the British parliament’s Public Accounts Committee said on Wednesday, decrying the “unimaginable” costs of the programme.The vast amounts spent on England’s test and trace system and its limited impact has drawn criticism, with opposition politicians calling for it to be run by the state-run health service.The Public Accounts Committee said that Test and Trace had cost 23 billion pounds ($32 billion) so far but had not achieved a key goal of avoiding a cycle of national lockdowns.“Despite the unimaginable resources thrown at this project Test and Trace cannot point to a measurable difference to the progress of the pandemic,” chair of the committee, opposition Labour party lawmaker Meg Hillier said.“The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown – has been broken, twice.”British minister Grant Shapps said on Wednesday the system had been set up from scratch, and it was playing a critical role in helping stop the spread of new variants of the disease.“Whatever the coronavirus experience we have had as a nation, good and bad, it would have been one heck of a lot worse if we didn’t have a test and trace system which has contacted so many people and prevented the disease from spreading further,” he told Sky News.The committee’s report said that Test and Trace was overly reliant on expensive contractors. Consultants working on the system cost 1,000 pounds a day.Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year promised a world beating test and trace system as part of the route out of the pandemic, though attention has now shifted to the rollout of vaccines.He has laid out plans for a cautious but irreversible route out of the third national lockdown which began on January 5, based on an aim to give everyone a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of July, as well as more regular testing.Last year scientific advisers said Test and Trace was not significantly reducing the spread of the coronavirus. England then entered a second lockdown in the autumn.Asked about the current impact of the system, Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance on Tuesday said the testing system was now good, and while the test and trace programme worked less well when infection levels were high, the system would take on renewed importance in the coming months.",Reuters
16,"Buyers of Olympic village condos left out in the cold after delayed Games
When Tokyo won the right to host the Olympic Games, enthusiastic buyers flocked to purchase luxury condominiums planned for the sprawling development that will house athletes during the event.
2:33AM EST",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-condo/buyers-of-olympic-village-condos-left-out-in-the-cold-after-delayed-games-idUSKBN2B203O,"TOKYO (Reuters) - When Tokyo won the right to host the Olympic Games, enthusiastic buyers flocked to purchase luxury condominiums planned for the sprawling development that will house athletes during the event.But with the Olympics delayed for a year because of the global pandemic, and with uncertainty still clouding the Games, buyers’ excitement has turned into frustration. Even as move-in dates have been pushed back by a year, they say they have heard little from the property companies.Two dozen buyers of units in Harumi Flag, the 5,600-condominium complex on the Tokyo waterfront, are seeking compensation for the delay from developers.“Any change in the move-in day is an extremely important factor in a real-estate sales contract,” said Hironobu Todoroki, a lawyer representing the buyers in civil mediation, which aims to resolve disputes through discussion.The property companies should have met with the buyers to explain the situation, he said, adding that he would consider a lawsuit if mediation failed.A spokeswoman for Mitsui Fudosan Residential, the lead developer among the 10 property companies involved, said it has responded to inquiries and would continue to do so.She said the company would continue to set up opportunities to explain the situation to buyers and respond as needed to civil mediation or other legal action.Buyers have been told they can back out of contracts because of the delay. Mitsui Fudosan Residential declined to say whether any contracts had been cancelled.One 45-year-old woman is among those seeking compensation. She and her husband have had to push back the sale of their home because of the delay.They bought a 95-square-metre (1,020 square feet) condominium in Harumi Flag for 85 million yen ($784,000). But she was “shocked” that the only contact about the delay was a brief letter from the developers. That was in sharp contrast to the many in-person meetings required when buying, she said.“After all that, I thought, ‘What? That’s it?’,” said the woman. She and other buyers spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Built on reclaimed land, Harumi Flag is designed to house about 12,000 people in 23 buildings. It includes shops, a park and a school. Tenants were supposed to move in starting in 2023. Mitsui Fudosan Residential declined to say how many units have been sold.A 37-year-old medical researcher said he bought a spacious 110-square-metre condominium because he plans to live with his fiancee and parents. But the unexpected delay means they are sharing his two-bedroom current home until the new condominium is ready.At 65 square metres, his current home is too cramped for four adults, he said.The project cost the Tokyo government 54 billion yen ($500 million), including road work and infrastructure. On top of that, the government paid 4.2 billion yen to the developers to lease the complex for a year, using it as the Olympic village for about 10,000 athletes.Because of the delay, the lease was extended for another year, for 4.2 billion yen.Todoroki, the lawyer, said he would raise the legitimacy of the lease extension in the civil mediation, given that the condominiums were already sold.The Tokyo government and Mitsui Fudosan Residential both said they saw no issue with extending the lease.Another buyer, a man in his 30s, said developers should use some of the 4.2 billion from the lease extension to pay compensation.Mitsui Fudosan Residential declined to comment on his situation.The delay had disrupted his plan to move a year before his daughter starts elementary school in 2024, he said.She will attend school in Harumi, he said. Now, he worries, she won’t be able to make friends and get settled before starting school.($1 = 108.4700 yen)",Reuters

When Tha Peng was ordered to shoot at protesters with his submachine gun to disperse them in the Myanmar town of Khampat on Feb. 27, the police lance corporal said he refused.
2:29AM EST",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-india-exclusive/exclusive-shoot-till-they-are-dead-some-myanmar-police-say-fled-to-india-after-refusing-orders-idUSKBN2B12U2,"CHAMPHAI, India (Reuters) - When Tha Peng was ordered to shoot at protesters with his submachine gun to disperse them in the Myanmar town of Khampat on Feb. 27, the police lance corporal said he refused.“The next day, an officer called to ask me if I will shoot,” he said. The 27-year-old refused again, and then resigned from the force.On March 1, he said he left his home and family behind in Khampat and travelled for three days, mostly at night to avoid detection, before crossing into India’s northeastern Mizoram state.“I had no choice,” Tha Peng told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday, speaking via a translator. He gave only part of his name to protect his identity. Reuters saw his police and national ID cards which confirmed the name.Tha Peng said he and six colleagues all disobeyed the Feb. 27 order from a superior officer, whom he did not name.Reuters could not independently verify his or other accounts gathered near the Myanmar-India border.The description of events was similar to that given to police in Mizoram on March 1 by another Myanmar police lance corporal and three constables who crossed into India, according to a classified internal police document seen by Reuters.The document was written by Mizoram police officials and gives biographical details of the four individuals and their account of why they fled. It was not addressed to specific people.“As the Civil disobedience movement is gaining momentum and protest(s) held by anti-coup protesters at different places we are instructed to shoot at the protesters,” they said in a joint statement to Mizoram police.“In such a scenario, we don’t have the guts to shoot at our own people who are peaceful demonstrators,” they said.Myanmar’s military junta, which staged a coup on Feb. 1 and deposed the country’s civilian government, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.The junta has said it is acting with utmost restraint in handling what it has described as demonstrations by “riotous protesters” whom it accuses of attacking police and harming national security and stability.Tha Peng’s is among the first cases reported by the media of police fleeing Myanmar after disobeying orders from the military junta’s security forces.Daily protests against the coup are being staged across the country and security forces have cracked down. More than 60 protesters have been killed and more than 1,800 detained, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group, has said.Reuters has not been able to confirm the figures independently.Among the detainees is Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who led the civilian government.Around 100 people from Myanmar, mostly policemen and their families, have crossed over a porous border into India since the protests began, according to a senior Indian official.Several have taken shelter in Mizoram’s Champhai district bordering Myanmar, where Reuters interviewed three Myanmar nationals who said they had served with the police.As well as his ID cards, Tha Peng showed an undated photograph of him wearing a Myanmar police uniform. He said he joined the force nine years ago.Tha Peng said that, according to police rules, protesters should either be stopped by rubber bullets or shot below the knees. Reuters could not verify police policies.But he was given orders by his superiors to “shoot till they are dead,” he added.Ngun Hlei, who said he was posted as a police constable in the city of Mandalay, said he had also received orders to shoot. He did not give a date, nor specify whether the order was to shoot to kill. He did not give details of any casualties.The 23-year-old also gave only a part of his full name and carried his national ID card.Tha Peng and Ngun Hlei said they believed police were acting under orders from Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw. They did not provide evidence.The other four Myanmar police agreed, according to the classified police document.“...the military pressured the police force who are mostly constables to confront the people,” they said.Ngun Hlei said he was reprimanded for disobeying orders and transferred. He sought help from pro-democracy activists online and found his way by road to Mizoram’s Vaphai village on March 6.The journey to India cost him around 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($143), Ngun Hlei said.Although guarded by Indian paramilitary forces, the India-Myanmar border has a “free movement regime”, which allows people to venture a few miles into Indian territory without requiring travel permits.‘DON’T WANT TO GO BACK’Twenty-four-year-old Dal said she had worked as a constable with Myanmar police in the mountainside town of Falam in northwestern Myanmar. Reuters saw a photograph of her police ID and verified the name.Her job was mostly administrative, including making lists of people detained by the police. But as protests swelled in the wake of the coup, she said she was instructed to try to catch female protesters - an order she refused.Fearing imprisonment for siding with the protesters and their civil disobedience movement, she said she decided to flee Myanmar.All three said that there was substantial support for the protesters within Myanmar’s police force.“Inside the police station, 90% support the protesters but there is no leader to unite them,” said Tha Peng, who left behind his wife and two young daughters, one six months old.Like some others who have crossed in recent days, the three are scattered around Champhai, supported by a network of local activists.Saw Htun Win, deputy commissioner of Myanmar’s Falam district last week wrote to Champhai’s top government official, Deputy Commissioner Maria C.T. Zuali, asking for eight policemen who had entered India to be returned to them “in order to uphold friendly relations between the two neighbour countries.”Zuali confirmed she had received the letter, a copy of which has been seen by Reuters.Zoramthanga, Mizoram’s chief minister, told Reuters that his administration would provide temporary food and shelter to those fleeing Myanmar, but a decision on repatriations was pending with India’s federal government.Tha Peng said that although he missed his family he feared returning to Myanmar.“I don’t want to go back,” he said, sitting in a first-floor room overlooking rolling green hills that stretch into Myanmar.",Reuters

But the sacking needed the approval of the president, which he declined to give twice.Pashinyan’s government said in a statement on Wednesday, however, that the dismissal was now legally effective as the president had not signed the decree within the given timeframe or gone to court under specific articles of the law.“...Gasparyan is legally dismissed from his post from March 10,” the statement said.President Armen Sarkissian on Wednesday appealed to the constitutional court to review the legality of Gasparyan’s sacking, the president’s office said in a statement.Pashinyan has faced calls to resign since last November when he agreed to a Russian-brokered ceasefire that halted six weeks of fighting between ethnic Armenian and Azeri forces over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.The deal secured significant territorial gains for Azerbaijan in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and until recently fully controlled by ethnic Armenians.Pashinyan, who has rejected calls to resign, said he had been compelled to agree to the peace deal to prevent greater human and territorial losses.",Reuters

One out of six Syrians had one of their parents either killed or wounded,” Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC’s regional director for the Middle East, told Reuters.“Rebuilding the country is on their shoulders and obviously it’s quite unfair,” he said in an interview at its headquarters.The report coincides with the 10th anniversary of the start of protests against President Bashar al-Assad’s rule that turned into a full-scale civil war. Assad’s military has now regained control of most of the country with Russian and Iranian help.Nearly half of young Syrians have lost their income because of the conflict and almost eight in 10 have reported struggling to afford food and other necessities, the report showed.“Women have been particularly hard hit economically, with almost 30% in Syria reporting no income at all to support their family,” the ICRC said.‘I TRY TO COMFORT THEM’A video released by the ICRC with the survey shows 33-year-old Mouna Shawat using crutches to walk on one foot past blocks of bombed out buildings on streets full of rubble in the Syrian city of Aleppo before being fitted with a prosthetic device at its rehabilitation centre.Shawat’s lower left leg had to be amputated several years ago after an improvised explosive device blew up as she made her way home.Shawat, who lives with her two children in Aleppo, recalls with nostalgia her youth before the civil war.“We had everything - gas, diesel, services. Now we are cold and hungry, and we need to wait for gas to get warm. Sometimes we have to cook over a fire,” she said.Referring to her children’s anxiety over her lost leg, she said: “To this day, every time it comes up they start crying, I try to comfort them.”",Reuters

And the goal here is basically to introduce the Quad as a new feature of regular diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific,” a senior administration official told Reuters separately.He said the meeting planned to announce financing agreements to support an increase in manufacturing capacity for coronavirus vaccines in India, something New Delhi has urged to counter China’s widening vaccine diplomacyThe aim was to reduce manufacturing backlogs, speed vaccination, and defeat some coronavirus mutations, the official said. Some of the additional vaccine capacity would be used in vaccination efforts in Southeast Asian countries.The United States is looking to strengthen ties with key allies and partners as China adopts an increasingly assertive foreign policy in Asia and elsewhere.The U.S. official said Friday’s engagement would last about two hours, and lay the groundwork for an in-person meeting later in the year.India, Australia and Japan had all been “directly challenged by China in the recent period,” he said, adding that the meeting was intended to work on “a different vision for the future” in the region.India’s Foreign Ministry said the leaders would address “regional and global issues of shared interest, and exchange views on practical areas of cooperation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.”It said the summit would also cover supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security and climate change.India said Quad leaders would discuss efforts to combat the pandemic and explore “opportunities for collaboration in ensuring safe, equitable and affordable vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region.”Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the meeting would focus on regional security and climate change.“It will be an historic moment in our region and it sends a strong message to the region about our support for a sovereign, independent Indo-Pacific,” he told reporters in Canberra.Friday’s meeting will take place days before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin plan to visit Japan and South Korea later this month.The visit by Blinken and Austin will be the first to the Asian allies by the top U.S. foreign policy and defense officials since the Biden administration took office in January.Biden’s administration has committed to reviewing elements of U.S. policies toward China in consultation with allies, as the world’s two largest economies navigate frosty relations that sank to their lowest depths in decades during the Trump administration.Asked whether the Quad could expand in future, the senior U.S. official said it remained an unofficial gathering, despite the decision to hold a leaders’ meeting.“Each country has highly attuned domestic politics and want constructive dialogues, but also want to maintain a degree of maneuver room,” he said.“We appreciate and understand that and seek to support it generally and we want to take it step by step. We have had discussions with other countries about other forms of informal association with the Quad and we expect those conversations will continue.”He said South Korea was one of those countries.",Reuters

Security Council failed to agree on a statement that would have condemned the coup in Myanmar, called for restraint by the military and threatened to consider “further measures.”Talks on the statement would likely continue, diplomats said, after China, Russia, India and Vietnam all suggested amendments late on Tuesday to a British draft, including removal of the reference to a coup and the threat to consider further action.The railway staff in Yangon are part of a civil disobedience movement that has crippled government business and included strikes at banks, factories and shops since the army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government in a coup on Feb. 1.Security forces have cracked down with increasing force on daily, nationwide protests, leaving the Southeast Asian nation in turmoil.More than 60 protesters have been killed and 1,900 people have been arrested since the coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group, has said.Footage posted on social media showed security forces near the railway staff compound. One person involved in the strike said by telephone they feared an imminent crackdown.“I think they are going to arrest us. Please help us,” said the person, who asked to be identified only as Ma Su rather than their full name.In a Facebook live broadcast from the area people chanted: “Are we staff united? Yes, we are united” and a commentator claimed police were trying to remove barricades and threatening to shoot.Details could not be independently verified. Police and army officials did not respond to requests for comment.In Myanmar’s second city, Mandalay, protesters staged a sit-in protest on Wednesday, chanting: “The resolution must prevail”.On Tuesday, Zaw Myat Linn, an official from Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD), died in custody after he was arrested, the second party figure to die in detention in two days.“He’s been participating continuously in the protests,” said Ba Myo Thein, a member of the dissolved upper house of parliament. The cause of death was not clear.In a Facebook live broadcast before he was detained, Zaw Myat Linn urged people to continue fighting the army, “even if it costs our lives”.In a symbolic gesture, an announcement posted on the NLD’s Facebook page on Tuesday said ousted lawmakers had appointed Mahn Win Khaing Than, who was the upper house speaker, as acting vice president to perform the duties of arrested President Win Myint and leader Suu Kyi. Mahn Win Khaing Than’s whereabouts were not known.Police on Tuesday also cracked down on independent media, raiding the offices of two news outlets and detaining two journalists.At least 35 journalists have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup, Myanmar Now reported, of which 19 have been released.Some police have refused orders to fire on unarmed protesters and have fled to neighbouring India, according to an interview with one officer and classified Indian police documents.“As the Civil disobedience movement is gaining momentum and protest(s) held by anti-coup protesters at different places we are instructed to shoot at the protesters,” four officers said in a joint statement to police in the Indian city of Mizoram.“In such a scenario, we don’t have the guts to shoot at our own people who are peaceful demonstrators,” they said.The United States is “repulsed” by the Myanmar army’s continued use of lethal force against its people and is continuing to urge the military to exercise “maximum restraint,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said on Tuesday.The army has justified the coup by saying that a November election won by the NLD was marred by fraud - a claim rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election, but has not said when that might be held.The junta has hired an Israeli-Canadian lobbyist for $2 million to “assist in explaining the real situation” of the army’s coup to the United States and other countries, documents filed with the U.S. Justice Department show.Ari Ben-Menashe and his firm, Dickens & Madson Canada, will represent Myanmar’s military government in Washington, as well as lobby Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and Russia, and international bodies like the United Nations, according to a consultancy agreement.International powers have condemned the takeover, which derailed a slow transition to democracy in a country that has been ruled by the military for long periods since independence from Britain in 1947.The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were forcibly repressed.",Reuters

He said the generals wanted to resettle Rohingya Muslims who fled a 2017 military assault for which the United Nations has accused those same generals of overseeing a genocide.“It is highly implausible that he could convince the United States of the narrative he’s proposing,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.Other documents submitted by Ben-Menashe showed the agreement was reached with the junta’s defense minister, General Mya Tun Oo and that the government would pay the firm $2 million.Mya Tun Oo and other top generals have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Canadian government, so the paperwork says the payment will be made “when legally permissible.”Lawyers told Reuters that Ben-Menashe could be in breach of sanctions.“To the extent that he is providing services to sanctioned parties from the United States without authorization, that would appear to be a violation of U.S. law,” said Peter Kucik, a former senior sanctions adviser at the U.S. Treasury.The U.S. Treasury Department declined to comment.Ben-Menashe told Reuters he had received legal advice that he would need licenses from Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) and the Canadian government to accept the payment, but that he would not be breaking the law by lobbying for the junta.“There’s technicalities here but we’ll leave it to the lawyers and OFAC to deal with it,” he said, adding his lawyers were in touch with Treasury officials.",Reuters

Toshiharu Onoda, a thirteenth-generation potter living in a town close to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, had just finished loading his kiln on March 11, 2011, when the massive earthquake struck.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-fukushima-anniversary-pottery-m/ten-years-after-disaster-fukushimas-singing-pottery-comes-home-idUSKBN2B20C1,"NAMIE, Japan (Reuters) - Toshiharu Onoda, a thirteenth-generation potter living in a town close to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, had just finished loading his kiln on March 11, 2011, when the massive earthquake struck.Clinging to a wall as the room filled with choking dust, Onoda watched stunned as his two-tonne kiln began to move across the floor.“Things were smashing all over the place, the kiln was clattering, everything inside just shattered,” he said in the dusty ruins of his studio in Namie, built roughly a century ago.Even in that dramatic moment, Onoda thought the danger would pass and he would continue at his studio.“I didn’t imagine I’d never work there again. I expected to start cleaning up the next morning,” he said ruefully.Instead, Onoda and nearly two dozen other potters were forced to evacuate within hours after reactor buildings at the plant owned by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) exploded, spewing radiation across the area where they’d lived and worked for over 300 years.Now, with restrictions relaxed, Onoda and the potters in the group he heads have been able to come back to downtown Namie to a new showroom and workspace complete with kilns, which opens in 10 days.“If we don’t make it in Namie, it’s not really Oborisoma-yaki,” said Onoda, his thick-fingered hands faintly dusted with clay, of the unique pottery known for the high-pitched singing sound made when kilns are opened and the glaze cracks.Though Namie in name, very little about the pottery or the process remains the same. Some 80% of the town in the Fukushima prefecture is still out of bounds due to high radiation and half the Namie potters have quit. The valley that was their base, echoing with the call of whippoorwills, remains off limits as well.Even the clay and glaze used to give their wares a distinctive blue-green sheen are unavailable since the materials used to make it can no longer be gathered from the valley and processed there.“It’s not quite the same,” Onada said of the clay he now uses, sourced from central Japan. The glaze, chemically recreated through over 100 experiments by Fukushima scientists, isn’t quite the same colour either.Onoda has been able to return and visit his house and studio, though the buildings are too damaged from weather and wild boars to be repaired. He won’t go there alone because it makes him depressed.Instead, he and the town have their hopes pinned on the gleaming new building in the centre of Namie where the nine remaining potters will sell their wares, teach, and fire their work in kilns.“Having a place for the potters to maintain their connection and community is essential,” said town official Yuichi Konno.“This pottery is an important part of Namie’s heart.”Onoda sees the new centre as a way of keeping the tradition alive, but he still dreams of having his own studio in Namie once again.“I want to be somewhere here in Namie, somehow,” he said. “In Namie, there’s scenery I know. It’s easier to relax.”",Reuters

The U.N. Security Council failed to agree on Tuesday on a statement that would have condemned the coup in Myanmar, called for restraint by the military and threatened to consider ""further measures,"" though diplomats said talks would likely continue.

Security Council failed to agree on Tuesday on a statement that would have condemned the coup in Myanmar, called for restraint by the military and threatened to consider “further measures,” though diplomats said talks would likely continue.During an initial bid to finalize the text, China, Russia, India and Vietnam all suggested amendments late on Tuesday to a British draft, diplomats said, including removal of the reference to a coup and the threat to consider further action.Such statements by the 15-member body are agreed by consensus.Myanmar has been in crisis since the army ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government in a Feb. 1 coup, detained her and officials of her National League for Democracy party and set up a ruling junta of generals.The military complained of fraud in a November election. The election commission said the vote was fair.The Security Council issued a statement to the press last month voicing concern over the state of emergency imposed by the Myanmar military and calling for the release of all those detained, but stopped short of condemning the coup due to opposition from Russia and China.“Every member state has a role to play individually and collectively. Collectively, we are always looking for a strong voice and strong action from the Security Council,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters earlier on Tuesday.More than 60 people have been killed and some 1,800 people detained in a crackdown on daily protests against the coup around the southeast Asian nation, an advocacy group has said. Dozens of journalists are among those arrested.The draft Security Council statement, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, called “on the military to exercise utmost restraint, emphasizes that it is following the situation closely, and states its readiness to consider possible further measures.”An independent U.N. human rights investigator on Myanmar and New York-based Human Rights Watch have called on the Security Council to impose a global arms embargo and targeted economic sanctions on the junta.But in an effort to preserve council unity on Myanmar, diplomats said sanctions were unlikely to be considered any time soon as such measures would probably be opposed by China and Russia, who - along with the United States, France and Britain - are council veto powers.The draft statement, which the council began discussing after a closed briefing on Friday on the situation, strongly condemned “the use of violence against peaceful protesters.”It also have expressed “deep concern at violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including restrictions on medical personnel, civil society, journalists and media workers, and calls for the immediate release of all those detained.”",Reuters

Along the banks of the Rio Grande in the scrubby grassland near Penitas, Texas, hundreds of colored plastic wristbands ripped off by migrants litter the ground, signs of what U.S. border officials say is a growing trend among powerful drug cartels and smugglers to track people paying to cross illegally into the United States.

Their use has not been widely reported before.Some migrants are trying to evade border agents, others are mostly Central American families or young children traveling without parents who turn themselves into officials, often to seek asylum.Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley sector, which spans more than 34,000 square miles (88,000 square kilometers)along the border in southeast Texas, have recently encountered immigrants wearing the bracelets during several apprehensions, said Matthew Dyman a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.The “information on the bracelets represents a multitude of data that is used by smuggling organizations, such as payment status or affiliation with smuggling groups,” Dyman told Reuters.The differing smuggling techniques come as Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration has sought to reverse restrictive immigration polices set up by his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. But a recent jump in border crossings has Republicans warning the easing of hardline policies will lead to an immigration crisis.U.S. border agents carried out nearly 100,000 apprehensions or rapid expulsions of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in February, according to two people familiar with preliminary figures, the highest monthly total since mid-2019.The categorization system illustrates the sophistication of organized criminal groups ferrying people across the U.S.-Mexico border, said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center“They run it like a business,” said Cardinal Brown, which means “finding more patrons and looking for efficiencies.” Migrants can pay thousands of dollars for the journey to the United States and human smugglers have to pay off drug cartels to move people through parts of Mexico.“This is a money-making operation and they have to pay close attention to who has paid,” she said. “This may be a new way to keep track.”Criminal groups operating in northern Mexico, however, have long used systems to log which migrants have already paid for the right to be in gang-controlled territory, as well as for the right to cross the border into the United States, migration experts said.When increased numbers of Central American were arriving at the border on express buses in 2019, smugglers kept tabs on them by double checking “the names and IDs of migrants before they got off the bus to make sure they had paid,” Cardinal Brown said.A migrant in Reynosa - one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico across the border from McAllen, Texas - who declined to give his name for fear of retaliation, showed Reuters a picture of a purple wristband he was wearing.He said he paid $500 to one of the criminal groups in the city after he arrived a few months ago from Honduras to secure the purple bracelet to protect against kidnapping or extortion. He said once migrants or their smugglers have paid for the right to cross the river, which is also controlled by criminal groups, they receive another bracelet.“This way we’re not in danger, neither us nor the ‘coyote,’” he said, using the Spanish word for smuggler.One human smuggler who spoke on conditions of anonymity, confirmed the bracelets were a system to designate who has paid for the right to transit through cartel territory.“They are putting these (bracelets) on so there aren’t killings by mistake,” he said.Migrants and smugglers say the use of bracelets to designate who has paid for the right to cross the river is a system required by the cartels that control waterfront territory in the conflict-ridden state of Tamaulipas.In January, a group of migrants were massacred in Tamaulipas state just 40 miles (70 km) west of Reynosa. Twelve local Mexican police have been arrested in connection with the massacre.",Reuters

U.S. prosecutors alleged on Tuesday that Honduras had become a ""narco-state"" with security forces and politicians, including President Juan Orlando Hernandez, working with traffickers to move large quantities of cocaine into the United States.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corruption-honduras/u-s-prosecutors-say-honduras-has-become-a-narco-state-idUSKBN2B207W,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors alleged on Tuesday that Honduras had become a “narco-state” with security forces and politicians, including President Juan Orlando Hernandez, working with traffickers to move large quantities of cocaine into the United States.In opening statements to the jury in the trial of alleged drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez, the prosecution said the defendant had paid Hernandez in order to receive protection from security forces in Honduras.Fuentes Ramirez pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of drug trafficking and related weapons offenses.“He was untouchable, a key part of the Honduran narco-state,” prosecutor Jacob Gutwillig said of Fuentes Ramirez in his opening statements to the jury.“This is a violent, armed cocaine trafficker, who worked with police, military, politicians, including the president, who made millions helping the president traffic cocaine.”Hernandez, who has repeatedly denied any involvement in drug trafficking, was a key ally to the United States under both the Obama and the Trump administrations, in both immigration and anti-narcotics operations in the region.The investigation could complicate the new Biden administration’s efforts to invest $4 billion in Central America, including Honduras, to address the causes of migration.In a series of tweets on Monday, Hernandez said that drug traffickers were giving false testimony against him to U.S. authorities as revenge against his government and to reduce their own sentences. He said Honduras’ anti-narcotics cooperation would be harmed if U.S. authorities believed them.According to the indictment, Hernandez, who has been president since 2014, used Honduran law enforcement and military officials to protect drug traffickers, including Fuentes Ramirez, who they said bribed Hernandez with $25,000.Prosecutors said Fuentes Ramirez began trafficking small amounts of drugs in 2009, but that it was not until 2013, when he partnered with Hernandez, then a presidential candidate, that his business started to “flourish.”The Drug Enforcement Administration agent who arrested Fuentes Ramirez in Miami in March 2020, Brian Fairbanks, testified for the prosecution on Tuesday that along with photos of assault rifles and cash, the agency found contact information for Hernandez in the businessman’s cell phones.Evidence submitted from Fuentes Ramirez’s cell phones and his son’s iCloud account showed a photo of Cristian Fuentes, the businessman’s brother and a current congressional candidate, with Hernandez, as well as contact information for ex-President Mel Zelaya and a number of high-ranking military and police officials.In court on Tuesday, the defense acknowledged that Fuentes Ramirez knew Hernandez through Fuad Jarufe, the owner of the rice business where the defendant allegedly paid bribes to Hernandez. However, defense lawyer Eylan Schulman said in his opening statement to the jury that the government’s case was “dependent on self-interested witnesses with too much to gain, too little to lose,” in reference to the self-confessed traffickers expected to testify against Fuentes Ramirez.Prosecutors alleged that Fuentes Ramirez reported “directly to Tony Hernandez,” the president’s brother, who was convicted in federal court in Manhattan of drug trafficking and related weapons charges in October 2019. In that trial, U.S. prosecutors said President Hernandez had accepted millions in bribes from drug traffickers. He has repeatedly denied the allegation.",Reuters

She rejected Trump’s demands to ditch it and buy liquefied gas from the United States, instead of being dependent on Putin’s Russia for energy.Germany has in recent months taken steps to meet U.S. concerns, extending its military mission in Afghanistan and planning to sail a warship across the South China Sea, where the Washington says freedom of navigation is threatened by China.Last year Germany enacted an IT security law setting high hurdles for makers of telecommunications equipment for next-generation networks, like China’s Huawei, though the legislation falls short of a blanket ban on using products made by the world’s largest maker - as demanded by Washington.(This story corrects last paragraph to delete reference to Huawei as a state-owned company)",Reuters
35,"Saddened Queen Elizabeth will address Harry and Meghan's racism accusation
Queen Elizabeth said on Tuesday the British royals were saddened by the challenging experiences of her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan and promised to privately address revelations about a racist remark about their son.

Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.”The Palace considered that this was a family matter, a royal source said, adding the royals should be given the opportunity to discuss the issues raised privately as a family.The interview was watched by 12.4 million viewers in Britain and 17.1 million in the United States, triggering a crisis to which the monarchy had to respond, media said.It has proved divisive among the British public, with some believing it showed how outdated and intolerant the institution was, while others decried it as a self-serving assault that neither Elizabeth nor her family deserved.“It could hardly be more damaging to the royal family, not least because there is little it can do to defend itself,” The Times said in a lead article under the title “Royal Attack”.“The key to the monarchy’s survival over the centuries has been its ability to adapt to the needs of the times. It needs to adapt again,” The Times said.Earlier on Tuesday, Charles made no comment when asked by a reporter what he thought of the interview while visiting a COVID-19 vaccine pop-up clinic in London.A royal source had said Elizabeth, 94, who has been on the throne for 69 years, wanted to take some time before the Palace issued a response, saying it needed careful consideration.A former senior royal aide said it was likely that the three most senior royals - the queen, Charles and Prince William, second in line to the throne and Harry’s elder brother, would have held meetings with their private secretaries and communications chiefs to decide on their response.“This is pretty important and they’ve got to judge it right,” said the former aide, adding the queen would have had the final say.In the interview, nearly three years since her wedding in Windsor Castle, Meghan gained sympathy in the United States by casting some unidentified members of the royal family as uncaring, mendacious or guilty of racist remarks.Meghan and Harry have also had a torrid relationship with the British press, successfully taking papers to court on occasions, and have repeatedly questioned what they say is reporting tainted by racist overtones.Harry said in the interview he did not know where to turn when faced with such troubling media coverage and felt hurt when his family failed to call out racist reporting.He said the royal family had an unhealthy silent agreement with the British tabloids and that the family was paranoid about the media turning on them.“There is a level of control by fear that has existed for generations,” Harry said.For the monarchy, which traces its history through 1,000 years of British and English history to William the Conqueror, Meghan’s bombshell has been compared to the crises over the death of Diana and the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson watched the interview, his spokesman said, but would not be making further comment on it.Johnson said on Monday he had the highest admiration for the queen but that he did not want to speak about the interview. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her nation was unlikely to stop having the queen as head of state soon.‘TRAPPED’Opponents of the monarchy said the allegations made by Meghan and Harry showed how rotten the institution was and that the Palace’s public relations machine had created a distorted image of the royals.“Now people are getting a much clearer picture of what the monarchy is really like. And it doesn’t look good,” said Graham Smith, head of Republic, a campaign group which seeks to abolish the monarchy.Royal supporters cast Meghan, 39, an American former actor, as a publicity seeker with an eye on Hollywood stardom.A YouGov poll found a majority of young people thought the royals’ treatment of the couple was unfair, while half of older people said the opposite.The gravity of the claims has raised questions about how the British monarchy, which survived centuries of revolution that toppled their cousins across Europe, could function in a meritocratic world.Meghan, whose mother is Black and father is white, said her son Archie, who turns two in May, had been denied the title of prince because there were concerns within the royal family “about how dark his skin might be when he’s born”.She declined to say who had voiced such concerns, as did Harry. Winfrey later told CBS that Harry had said it was not the queen or her 99-year-old husband Philip, who has been in hospital for three weeks while the crisis unfolds.Meghan’s estranged father Thomas Markle, who she has not spoken to since her wedding, said he did not think the British royal family was racist.",Reuters

The Senate version eliminated or pared back some provisions included in the House bill, which had increased the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and extended expanded jobless assistance through Aug. 29.Now that it has passed the Senate, it must be approved again by the House before it can make its way to Biden’s desk and be signed into law.Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol that the timing of a vote on the House floor “depends on when we get the paper from the Senate.”“We’d take it up Wednesday morning at the latest,” she said.Like the Senate, Democrats hold a very narrow majority in the chamber, meaning they cannot withstand many votes against the bill.The first version of the bill passed in the House without a single Republican vote. Two moderate Democrats joined Republicans in voting against that version. One of them, Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, said on Monday he would now vote for the bill with the Senate changes.“My concerns remain on the size and scope of this bill but believe the Senate changes provide meaningful relief for Oregonians in need,” Schrader wrote on Facebook.“Funding for our local governments, small businesses, schools, families, healthcare providers and an extension on unemployment benefits will be a lifeline for many,” he said of the legislation.Republicans, who broadly supported coronavirus relief early in the pandemic, have criticized the price tag of the Biden relief package.On Friday, as the Senate vote was still under way, House Democratic lawmaker Bonnie Watson Coleman said she was “disgusted” by some of the changes in the Senate bill and questioned if she could support it. A spokesman for her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But Representative Pramila Jayapal, head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters she thought members of the group would back the legislation, which she described as “phenomenal” and in keeping with most of its members’ priorities.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised the legislation at a news conference, saying that while there were some changes on the margins, it represented the “core” of what Biden originally proposed.",Reuters
38,Republican Party says it will continue to use Trump name in fundraising appeals,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-republicans/republican-party-says-it-will-continue-to-use-trump-name-in-fundraising-appeals-idUSKBN2B103Z,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican Party intends to keep using former President Donald Trump’s name in fundraising pitches and other materials, a lawyer for the party said on Monday, despite a cease-and-desist letter from Trump last week.The letter sent by lawyers for Trump on Friday to the Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Campaign and National Republican Senate Campaign had ramped up tension between the two camps as Trump seeks to preserve his political viability post-election.A Trump adviser said on Saturday that Trump was sensitive to the use of his name and likeness for branding purposes and was irked the three groups have supported Republican lawmakers who joined Democrats in voting to impeach him over the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.In a response letter, the Republican National Committee said that Trump “reaffirmed” to RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel over the weekend that he approves of the party’s current use of his name, wrote Justin Riemer, the RNC’s top lawyer.The party also argued it had “every right to refer to public figures as it engages in core, First Amendment-protected political speech.”The letter indicated Trump would participate in the party’s donor retreat scheduled for next month in Palm Beach, Florida, which is home to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.But in a statement late on Monday, Trump declared: “No more money for RINOS,” the acronym for the pejorative term “Republicans in Name Only.”“They do nothing but hurt the Republican Party and our great voting base — they will never lead us to Greatness,” Trump said before urging supporters to donate to his own super PAC.In an effort separate from the Republican Party, Trump is using his Save America super PAC to raise money in part to help handpicked Republican candidates in the 2022 congressional elections. Some of them are expected to challenge Republican incumbents whom Trump considers disloyal.Still, Trump has committed to helping Republicans try to win back control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2022 elections that will be an early referendum on the leadership of Democratic President Joe Biden.",Reuters
39,"Special Report: Ten years on, grief never subsides for some survivors of Japan's tsunami

I’m worried you’ll kick up a fuss when you return and ask where I put your shoes, so I’ve left them by the door without polishing them.- Letter from Sachiko Kumagai to her husband after he was lost in the tsunami.When the tide finally receded, the world had changed. Trucks and houses had been swept aside like children’s toys, leaving the living to comb through a wasteland of mud and debris for their dead. Ten years on, the living are still searching, their grief never subsiding.A father lives alone in a house at the end of a long driveway lined with cherry trees. He surrounds himself with books on the disorder that isolated his younger son in his room, unable to flee even when his mother begged him to evacuate as the tsunami roared toward them.A mother is haunted still by the cries of stranded children, maybe even her own, calling out for help in the darkness. Even now she carries around a laminated schedule of her daughter’s kindergarten bus, as if to prove that her 6-year-old should still be alive.A wife never gave up hope that her husband would return to her. In scribbled letters on the back of calendars, she chided her husband for staying away, sometimes writing his imagined response encouraging her to go on without him.The 10th anniversary of the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami will be a nationally televised event, with dignitaries in black suits gathering at a theater in Tokyo, where they will bow their heads and mark the moment of the disaster. For many survivors, the day will be marked by quiet prayers and family visits to gravesites.But for others, the day will feel little different than any other date on a calendar. They remain suspended, trapped in those frantic hours a decade ago.The earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 20,000 people on a stretch of Japan’s Pacific coast more than 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Tokyo. The disasters also triggered multiple meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents.The central government pledged to rebuild the region and has spent around 31 trillion yen ($286 billion) on reconstruction. In the span of a few years, Japan built new neighborhoods, parks and schools. But the scale of loss here is beyond any policy response. Thousands of residents have moved away from the hardest-hit cities, with many of those who remain haunted by all that was lost.While some survivors look backward, the larger Japanese public is preparing to celebrate the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, an event the government is intent on using to showcase its recovery from the disaster.In Rikuzentakata, a city that lost almost a tenth of its population in the tsunami, a 12.5-meter (41-foot) sea wall encircles the coastline, a project designed to protect residents from future floods. Instead, the city can feel like a fortress where the concrete wall obscures any view of the ocean. On a chilly night in March, a howling wind drowned out any sound of lapping waves. In the darkness, only a slither of the sea was visible above the slabs of concrete, its serene surface concealing the noiseless churn of water below.Yoshihito Sasaki, 70, can see the ocean from his front room, but he has long ago given up fishing or taking walks by the sea. He moved into his current home after the tsunami swept away his old house here, where he lived with his wife and two sons.In March 2011, Sasaki was a few weeks shy of retirement, working as a principal in an elementary school built on higher ground in Hirota, a fishing village half an hour’s drive from his family’s home.After making sure that all of his students were safe, and learning that his older son, Yoichi, had survived, Sasaki began searching for the rest of his family. He had already assumed the worst about his other son, 28-year-old Jinya, who had been a “hikikomori” for a decade, a Japanese term for people who withdraw from society. When the disaster hit, Jinya hadn’t left their house for two years.“I thought maybe my wife had survived, so when I went to shelters, I asked them if they saw a woman who had lost her mind,” Sasaki said quietly, averting his eyes. He knew that leaving her son behind in the tsunami would have destroyed Mikiko, his wife.Sasaki was unable to find Mikiko in any of the evacuation centers. Her body was recovered weeks later.Later, he learned that his wife had tried to coax their son out of the house as the water kept rising. Jinya refused to leave, saying until the end that he didn’t want to see other people. Mikiko finally ran out of the house, taking shelter on a neighbor’s roof with their elder son. From there, they watched the wave swallow their home.Sasaki took off his glasses and busied himself with a pile of newspaper clippings on his table. A warm orange light filled the room, which was still cluttered with boxes his surviving son left behind when he moved out in December.For almost a decade after the disaster, Sasaki and his son lived together but never discussed the day of the tsunami. The two men finally talked over sushi a few months ago, when his son was preparing to move away.“I asked my son what my wife said to him at the end,” Sasaki said. The last time his son saw her, she was holding onto a piece of wreckage in a black tide, yelling out to him. “He told me that she was screaming for him to live,” he said, sighing. “She told him to survive.”Yoichi held onto wreckage and drifted for hours in the tsunami’s waters before he was finally rescued.After the tsunami, Sasaki bought dozens of books about his late son’s condition, out of regret that he had not done more to support his late wife. Turning on the fluorescent light in his room, Sasaki pulled out a folder full of newsletters that he has written in the past decade about the hikikomori. He also moderates a support group for parents every month where he listens to others vent and cry about their reclusive children.Even so, Sasaki is plagued by regret. Several times, he repeats that his older son may still blame him for not doing more to help his wife with Jinya.“I thought maybe time would solve things, but I know now that’s not the case. There are things you want to forget but can’t,” he said, with a pause. “Some memories, those key memories in your mind, are actually more vivid now.”In Ishinomaki, a coastal city in neighboring Miyagi prefecture, nearly 3,200 people died in the disaster. One of them was Airi, Mika Sato’s daughter, who loved playing with her little sister and wanted to be a TV presenter when she grew up.Airi was at a local kindergarten when the earthquake struck. Shortly after, teachers put Airi and four others on a bus, which took them down the hill and closer to the coast.It took three days for Sato to find Airi. She walked through a field of rubble where thin plumes of smoke still smoldered between bits of plywood and metal. One of the other parents eventually found the charred remains of a yellow school bus hidden under what had been the metal roof of a house.“By the time we found them, all that was left of her was as small as a baby’s,” said Sato, cradling her arms as if she were holding her daughter. “We were so afraid the wind would blow them away.”Sato said it wasn’t until later that she heard from neighbors that they could hear children calling for help until midnight, hours after a 28-foot tsunami swept into Ishinomaki.Sato and other parents kept asking the school for an explanation of what exactly happened on the day of the tsunami. Five months after the disaster, Sato and three other families filed a lawsuit against the operator of the kindergarten.“We thought we would find the truth in court,” said Sato, 46. “It was completely different from what we expected; we didn’t get anywhere near the truth.” Sato had hoped that the school would explain why it had decided to put the children on a bus toward the coast after a massive quake, but school staff repeated in court that they had not heard the tsunami siren, she said.Sato and other plaintiffs reached a settlement with the school in 2014. As part of the settlement, the school took legal responsibility and promised to provide a “heartfelt apology” to the families, Sato and her lawyer, Kenji Kamada, said. Though the school has sent flowers, Sato said she has never received a formal apology.A lawyer who represented the school, which is now closed, said it continued to send flowers to the families involved in the case every year. He declined to comment further on the matter, referring questions on the details of the settlement to the plaintiffs.Sighing, Sato walked to a memorial built along a busy coastal road, close to where she had found her daughter. Taking off her mask, she touched Airi’s name carved into stone.“The anger doesn’t go away,” she said, adding that as a naturally shy person, she had never wanted to be a public figure embroiled in such a court case. “Our precious daughter died and the fact that …,” she started to say, before a local man approached her, saying he recognized her from TV interviews.After reminiscing about the disaster, the man told her it was shameful that people went to court for money after the disaster.“Didn’t you get like 300 million yen?” the man asked.“Actually no, we didn’t,” Sato answered calmly, before the man cut her off.“We all suffered and it’s time to move on,” he mumbled before walking away.Afterward, Sato said most locals had been supportive, but others believe survivors like her shouldn’t have pursued their cases in court. The family members of four of the children who died on the bus shared a settlement of 60 million yen ($550,000), Sato’s lawyer said. Civil lawsuits like the one filed by Sato are much less common in Japan compared to in the United States.“I’ve gotten kind of used to it by now,” Sato said sadly, walking back to her parked car. She wondered aloud how the man would react if he had lost his own child or grandchild in such a devastating disaster.“Some people say heartless things, but people who don’t understand will never understand, no matter what you say.”Across Japan’s northeast region, more than 2,500 people are still reported missing from the disaster. In Iwate Prefecture, police officers hold monthly walk-in sessions at local shopping malls and community centers for families who haven’t stopped searching for their loved ones. At these meetings, police officers take down identifying details about the missing and sometimes collect DNA samples from family members.The lack of remains and the difficulty of the search have prolonged the sense of limbo for some families.Three months after the tsunami, Sachiko Kumagai began writing letters to Migaku, her husband, a beloved local fisheries worker who went missing after he left his hillside home on the day of the disaster. He was 71, and she was 69. Her letters, hundreds of them, usually written with a magic marker, start with the weather and a description of the breakfast she had set out for him, and are interspersed with her gnawing questions about where he might be.In several, Kumagai responds as her husband.“Mama-chan, I won’t be able to return even if you keep brooding over it … I’ll be waiting for you, you can do it, you can.”Hitoshi Tsurizaki, 71, first met Kumagai when he was volunteering after the disaster in Rikuzentakata. In an effort to help her process her grief, Tsurizaki offered to type up Kumagai’s letters and bound them in books for her.“I think there are a lot of people who wish things could go back to how they were, which we know is not possible,” he said. A lack of conclusive proof that their family members had died pushed some to fall into a state of magical thinking, he said, allowing them to grasp at all sorts of explanations for their loved ones’ sudden banishment.“If typing up those letters helped her in any way process his passing, then I’m grateful,” he said.Makoto Kumagai, the couple’s 51-year-old son, said he didn’t understand his parents’ bond until he read some of his mother’s letters.In 2017, six years after the tsunami, Kumagai finally filed her husband’s death certificate. Kumagai died a year later. In one of her final letters, she seemed resigned to her loss.“Good morning Migaku-san. Not many days left in the year. Seems like we’ll finish out another year without finding you … Wouldn’t it be a miracle if you wander back to the Ono Bay? I’ve heard miracles exist, but it doesn’t seem to in this disaster.”",Reuters

MORENA has a majority in both chambers of Congress.Lopez Obrador has argued that decriminalizing cannabis and other narcotics could help combat Mexico’s powerful drug cartels.Colombian-Canadian Khiron Life Sciences, Canada’s Canopy Growth and The Green Organic Dutchman, as well as Medical Marijuana, Inc. from California, are among the firms eyeing opportunities in Mexico.Legalized cannabis could “dramatically transform the economic landscape” in Mexico by creating jobs and increasing tax revenues, said Medical Marijuana, Inc. chief executive Stuart Titus.“Much of Mexico’s cannabis has been black market and the resulting war on drugs has proven to be a huge failure.

44,"Ten years after Fukushima, Japan remembers 'man-made' nuclear disaster
When a huge earthquake and tsunami struck Japan on March 11, 2011, devastating towns and triggering nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, a stunned world watched the chaotic struggle to contain the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-fukushima-anniversary-legacy/ten-years-after-fukushima-japan-remembers-man-made-nuclear-disaster-idUSKBN2B103H,"TOKYO (Reuters) - When a huge earthquake and tsunami struck Japan on March 11, 2011, devastating towns and triggering nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima, a stunned world watched the chaotic struggle to contain the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.An onslaught of waves sparked by the 9.0-magnitude quake crashed into the northeastern coast, killing nearly 20,000 people and crippling the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant. More than 160,000 residents fled as radiation spewed into the air.At the time, some - including Prime Minister Naoto Kan - feared Tokyo would need to be evacuated, or worse.“Fukushima is stamped for the rest of the history of nuclear energy,” said Kiyoshi Kurokawa, head of an investigation that concluded the disaster was “profoundly man-made”.The government has spent about $300 billion (32.1 trillion yen) to rebuild the tsunami-devastated Tohoku region, but areas around the Fukushima plant remain off-limits, worries about radiation levels linger and many who left have settled elsewhere. Decommissioning of the crippled plant will take decades and billions of dollars.Japan is again debating the role of nuclear power in its energy mix as the resource-poor country aims to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2050 to fight global warming. But an NHK public TV survey showed 85% of the public worries about nuclear accidents.Energy policy was left in limbo after Shinzo Abe led his pro-nuclear energy Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) back to power the year after the disaster, ousting the novice Democratic Party of Japan, whose image was tainted by its handling of Fukushima.“They sort of left things adrift,” said Tobias Harris, senior vice president at consultancy Teneo and author of a book about Abe.‘RESULT OF COLLUSION’Kurokawa’s commission, appointed by parliament, concluded in 2012 that the Fukushima accident was “the result of collusion between the government, regulators and Tokyo Electric Power Co” and a lack of governance.Abe resigned last year, citing poor health, and his successor, Yoshihide Suga, has announced a goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050.Proponents say nuclear power is vital to decarbonization. Critics say cost, safety and the challenge of storing nuclear waste are all reasons to avoid it.“Those talking about atomic power are people in the ‘nuclear village’, who want to protect their vested interests,” former Prime Minister Kan told a news conference last week.The mass demonstrations against nuclear power seen in the wake of 3/11 have faded, but distrust lingers.A February Asahi newspaper survey found that nationwide, 53% are opposed to restarting reactors, compared with 32% in favour. In Fukushima, only 16% backed bringing restarting units.“Ten years have passed and some people have forgotten. The zeal is gone,” said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo political science professor. “Restarts are not happening, so people think if they just wait, nuclear power will disappear.”Only nine of Japan’s 33 remaining commercial reactors have been approved for restarts under post-Fukushima safety standards and only four are operating, compared with 54 before the disaster.Nuclear power supplied just 6% of Japan’s energy needs in the first half of 2020 compared with 23.1% for renewable sources - far behind Germany’s 46.3% - and nearly 70% for fossil fuels.Extending the lifespan of Japan’s 33 existing commercial reactors to 60 years, there would be only 18 in 2050 and none by 2069, said Takeo Kikkawa, an adviser to the government on energy policy. Newer business lobbies are pushing for renewable energy.“Japan is a resource-poor country so we should not casually abandon the nuclear option,” Kikkawa told a media briefing. “But in reality, the future of nuclear power is bleak.”(1 Japanese yen = $0.0094)",Reuters

Our expectations are that it will be done in within the next month or so,” the official said.Biden’s Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the approach to North Korea could involve more sanctions or unspecified diplomatic incentives.The senior administration official said the U.S. officials involved in the review had been engaged with diplomacy in one manner or other since the mid 1990s.“Our expectations are probably very much shaped by previous experiences,” he said, while noting “some interesting dynamics about the previous, the most immediate, period.”“I think we want to explore a variety of different things,” he said without elaborating on the content.The official said North Korea would be among the topics discussed at a first summit of the Quad group of nations - the United States, Japan, India and Australia on Friday. It will also be a topic when Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin visit Japan and South Korea later this month.The Pentagon expressed concern last week about a U.N. report indicating possible preprocessing of nuclear fuel for bombs by North Korea, and said such activity could raise tensions with Pyongyang.A confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters last month said North Korea developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020.",Reuters
46,"Analysis: Japan's 'solidarity' quake tax may be model to foot pandemic bill
Japan is paying for the huge cost of rebuilding areas hit by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami with a special ""solidarity"" tax that could become a model to shoulder the much bigger spending needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

For those with annual taxable income of 10 million yen ($92,000), that equates to an extra 37,000 yen a year.While companies were supposed to pay an extra 10% tax for three years, they were off the hook after two years, which critics say was due in part to pressure from the powerful Keidanren business lobby amid global competition to lower corporate tax rates.For politicians, it’s a model that works.Unlike Japan’s unpopular sales tax that was doubled in two stages to 10% from 2014 to 2019, households won’t feel pain each time they shop. Branding it as a “solidarity” special tax helps convince voters the levy is for a collective good.Ruling party lawmakers say tax hikes would be a last resort in footing the cost of combating COVID-19 that has so far topped 70 trillion yen - more than double the spending for post-quake and tsunami reconstruction.But Finance Minister Taro Aso flagged the chance of another special tax once the economy emerges from the pandemic’s hit.“Whenever a crisis hit, we took bold fiscal steps and the current generation strived to share the burden,” Aso told the lower house financial committee last month, suggesting debate over a tax hike cannot be avoided in the long run.Japan spent 31.3 trillion yen on reconstruction from the earthquake and tsunami - roughly the size of Egypt’s economy - with another 1.6 trillion yen earmarked for the coming five years.Revenues from the special tax paid for about 40% of the cost, around four-fifths of which was collected from households.The additional tax of 2.1% was imposed on the amount of tax paid by individuals with the tax rates running as high as 45%, compared to the effective company tax rate of around 30%.Some lawmakers, such as members of the Japanese Communist Party, criticise the special tax as imposing too much of a burden on households. But their voices are few.The biggest opposition party has kept mum as the tax was rolled out under a government led by some of its current members. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, known as pro-business, sees no merit in rocking the boat.With Japan saddled with public debt 2.5 times the size of its economy, talk of a “post-pandemic solidarity tax” cannot be avoided, said Masahiro Kawai, a former finance ministry official and University of Tokyo professor who is now heading the Economic Research Institute for Northeast Asia.“Such a tax would gain people’s understanding if they perceive it as necessary to protect their livelihood and human capital,” he said.Others are sceptical. The pandemic has upended lives for almost the entire population, unlike March 2011, where people living in areas unaffected could rally to save those who faced devastation.“It might be difficult to ask households to evenly share the burden this time, given a widening disparity between haves and have-nots since the coronavirus outbreak,” said Hosei University Professor Kazumasa Oguro.($1 = 108.7500 yen)",Reuters

48,"Remote Siberian data center reaps rewards of bitcoin rally
Four thousand kilometres from Moscow near the shores of the Angara River, a Russian firm operating a vast data centre run on cheap local hydroelectric power is reaping the rewards of bitcoin's surging prices and plans to double its power output this year.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cryptocurrencies-bitriver/remote-siberian-data-center-reaps-rewards-of-bitcoin-rally-idUSKBN2B11RJ,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Four thousand kilometres from Moscow near the shores of the Angara River, a Russian firm operating a vast data centre run on cheap local hydroelectric power is reaping the rewards of bitcoin’s surging prices and plans to double its power output this year.BitRiver hosts equipment at its flagship 100-megawatt data centre in the city of Bratsk, along with other smaller sites, for foreign miners of the cryptocurrency from the United States, Europe and Japan who want to harness the region’s cheap energy.The company could already be responsible for as much as 2% of global bitcoin mining, Chief Executive Igor Runets estimated, but added precise figures in the sector were hard to come by.The price of bitcoin has risen almost 300% since the start of November and topped $50,000 dollars for the first time last month, as Tesla Inc bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and other large companies and investment houses followed small traders into the asset.Bitcoin is earned -- or ‘mined’ -- by using your computer to help process the uncrackable “blockchains” or digital transaction records that underpin the currency.This requires huge computing capacity, and a lot of electricity, and so is mostly done with huge machines in aircraft hangar-sized warehouses in the cooler climates of Iceland, Canada, northern China and Russia, where it costs less to disperse the heat generated.The rewards for those who can verify transactions in the process which produces bitcoins have never been greater.“Current demand from our clients exceeds 700 megawatts and is approaching one gigawatt,” said Runets. “We will of course continue to build data processing centres. In 2021, we plan to reach 300 megawatts of power.”Another 100-megawatt centre is already under construction in the neighbouring Buryatiya region, Runets said.Big deals with foreign firms, such as one last December which saw 14 lorries full of equipment arrive in Bratsk, can boost the local economy and are a sign that BitRiver has become a global player, he said in a company video.Russia granted cryptocurrencies legal status last year, but banned them from being used as a means of payment.“Current legislation in Russia does not hamper us in any way,” Runets said. “It allows us to host foreign clients’ computing equipment on Russian territory with settlements for this in dollars or roubles.”This arrangement reduces the financial impact of bitcoin price swings on BitRiver.“When bitcoin falls or rises, my profit, my revenue remains almost unchanged,” Runets said. “This financial stability in a volatile market is very valuable.”More liberal legislation would lead to greater investment from Russian players, Runets added, which could help BitRiver improve on its 2.5x year-on-year revenue growth in 2020. He declined to disclose further financial details.One of the primary concerns levelled at bitcoin miners is their carbon footprint. Runets said BitRiver uses more than 90% green power as it builds data centres in regions with electricity surpluses and renewable energy sources nearby.Russia accounts for about 7% of the world’s bitcoin mining, according to Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, a figure that does not include grey-market players and those illegally connecting to power grids.Kazakhstan is responsible for a similar figure, while China is the market leader.",Reuters
49,"U.S. Supreme Court dumps last of Trump's election appeals
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday disposed of the last of three cases brought to the justices by former President Donald Trump challenging his election loss, bringing a muted end to his futile quest in the courts to hold onto power.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election/u-s-supreme-court-dumps-last-of-trumps-election-appeals-idUSKBN2B01LE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday disposed of the last of three cases brought to the justices by former President Donald Trump challenging his election loss, bringing a muted end to his futile quest in the courts to hold onto power.The court without comment rejected Trump’s appeal challenging thousands of absentee ballots filed in Wisconsin, an election battleground that the Republican businessman-turned-politician lost to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 20,000 votes. Biden became president on Jan. 20.It was the last of three petitions filed at the Supreme Court near the end of Trump’s presidency that the justices declined to take up. The court on Feb. 22 turned away Trump’s other two appeals - a second Wisconsin challenge and one relating to voting in Pennsylvania, another pivotal state Trump lost. Lower courts previously had ruled against Trump in those three cases.It already was clear that the high court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump, had no intention to intervene in the cases and others filed by his allies because it did not act before Congress on Jan. 6 certified Biden’s victory. That formal certification was interrupted when a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol.In the Wisconsin case, Trump sued two days after the state had certified its election results. He challenged several Wisconsin election policies including one allowing the use of drop boxes for absentee ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both a federal judge and the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claims, noting in part that Trump had waited too long to sue.Courts around the country rejected the cases brought by Trump and his allies, sometimes in colorful terms. A judge put it this way in November in rejecting a Trump challenge in Pennsylvania: “This claim, like Frankenstein’s Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together.”Trump has made - and continues to make - false claims that the Nov. 3 presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and irregularities. Republicans are now seizing on those same unsubstantiated allegations in an effort to impose new voting restrictions in numerous states.The Supreme Court on Monday also turned away another election-related case filed by Trump ally Lin Wood, who had asked the justices to block the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections in Georgia. The court never acted on the request and Democrats won both races, giving them narrow control of the Senate.",Reuters
50,U.S. Supreme Court rejects case over 'qualified immunity' for police,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-qualifiedimmunity/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-case-over-qualified-immunity-for-police-idUSKBN2B01L6,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped a chance to review the scope of a legal defense called qualified immunity that increasingly has been used to shield police accused of excessive force, turning away an appeal by a Cleveland man who sued after being roughed up by police while trying to enter his own home.The justices declined to hear the appeal by Shase Howse, who said he was slammed to the ground outside the house where he lived with his mother in a poor and mostly Black neighborhood, struck in the back of the neck and jailed after police deemed his actions suspicious. Howse, who was 20 at the time, is Black. The police involved in the 2016 incident are white.Qualified immunity protects police officers and other types of government officials from civil litigation in certain circumstances, allowing lawsuits only when an individual’s “clearly established” statutory or constitutional rights have been violated.Police use of force has been closely scrutinized following the May 2020 death of a Black man named George Floyd after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck.The U.S. House of Representatives last Wednesday passed policing reform legislation that among other provisions would eliminate the qualified immunity defense for law enforcement. The legislation, supported by most Democrats and opposed by Republicans, faces an uphill battle in the Senate.Howse’s case was featured in a Reuters investigation into qualified immunity published in December. The investigation illustrated how the endorsement of this defense by courts has denied Black Americans recourse to justice under a law enacted 150 years ago specifically to protect them from abuses by state and local authorities in the post-Civil War years.Howse sued two police officers, Brian Middaugh and Thomas Hodous, accusing them of excessive force in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The officers said they used only the force necessary to subdue Howse.The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 granted the officers qualified immunity, ruling that no “clearly established” precedent showed that their actions were unlawful.In May 2020, a Reuters investigation revealed how qualified immunity, under the careful stewardship of the Supreme Court, has made it easier for police to kill or injure civilians with impunity by shielding them from lawsuits, even when courts determine police actually violated a person’s constitutional rights.Law enforcement professionals and some U.S. conservatives have argued that qualified immunity is essential for police to make quick decisions in dangerous situations without fear of lawsuits.In recent months, the Supreme Court has signaled a potential softening of its approach to qualified immunity. In two cases the justices allowed inmates to sue prison guards who had been granted immunity by lower courts from accusations that they violated the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.",Reuters
51,Biden's picks for key Justice Department posts face confirmation scrutiny,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-justice-preview/bidens-picks-for-key-justice-department-posts-face-confirmation-scrutiny-idUSKBN2B01IN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In her first big civil rights case after law school, Vanita Gupta two decades ago challenged the wrongful drug convictions of dozens of Black residents of the Texas Panhandle city of Tulia, all of which hinged on faulty testimony by an undercover police officer with a checkered past.Gupta, then a junior lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, went toe to toe with the local prosecutor. But she nonetheless managed to charm him so much that he sent her friendly emails with his daily morning thoughts, other members of the defense team recalled.“We were saying it was prosecutorial misconduct, and misconduct by the sheriff’s department that should get all these folks out of prison ... and meanwhile he is sending her his inspiring morning email,” civil rights attorney Jennifer Klar, a friend of Gupta, said of the case.The governor of Texas eventually issued pardons for Gupta’s clients. Gupta is now President Joe Biden’s nominee to serve as associate U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department’s No. 3 job. Her powers of persuasion and ability to win over adversaries will be put to an important test this week.Gupta is set to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a confirmation hearing on Tuesday along with Lisa Monaco, Biden’s nominee for the Justice Department’s No. 2 job. Gupta has drawn opposition from some conservatives, including the Judicial Crisis Network activist group, and is believed to face a tougher confirmation battle than Monaco in the closely divided Senate.Law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police and some high-profile conservatives including Grover Norquist have urged the Senate to confirm Gupta.The committee already has approved Biden’s nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland as attorney general. Garland awaits a confirmation vote on the Senate floor.‘HEART OF A LION’Monaco has drawn endorsements from figures in both parties, notably including Republican former attorneys general Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey.“We come from different political perspectives,” said Cliff Stricklin, a Republican attorney and partner with the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, who said he got to know Monaco when they worked together on a team that prosecuted executives from the defunct energy company Enron.“She has the heart of a lion,” Stricklin said. “When I saw she was nominated for the position of deputy attorney general, I thought she is the perfect person at the perfect time for that role.”Gupta and Monaco are expected to face questions from senators on topics ranging from civil rights enforcement to how the Justice Department will protect against future attacks by domestic extremists.Gupta’s portfolio, if she wins Senate confirmation, would include supervising civil rights, antitrust, environmental and community policing matters.If confirmed as deputy attorney general, Monaco would oversee the Justice Department’s criminal and national security matters and play a vital role in formulating criminal justice policies. She would help oversee the department’s sprawling investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of former President Donald Trump’s supporters.Now with the law firm O’Melveny & Myers, Monaco served as former President Barack Obama’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser and has extensive experience as a prosecutor and attorney on national security matters.In addition to serving on the government’s multi-agency task force that focused on wrongdoing by Enron after its 2001 collapse, Monaco worked at the FBI advising its former director Robert Mueller and later served as assistant attorney general in the National Security Division from 2011 to 2013 under Obama.The road for Gupta may be rockier.As the former acting assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, Gupta oversaw high-profile investigations into systemic abuses by police departments in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri. Former President Donald Trump’s Justice Department scuttled similar types of investigations into police misconduct.Gupta became a Trump critic when she served as head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights advocacy group.The Judicial Crisis Network recently starting running a television ad incorrectly claiming Gupta told Reuters in a article last June that she supports defunding police - a statement she did not make.Defending Democracy Together, an anti-Trump Republican group, has launched its own campaign to back Gupta’s nomination, running ads targeting senators seen as swing votes including centrist Democrat Joe Manchin, and launching a website called ConfirmingGupta.com.“The breadth of her support is quite deep and unique,” said Wade Henderson, who took over as interim head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights after Gupta’s nomination. “She is a proven consensus-builder.”",Reuters

He said that without Europe, it would not have been possible to develop and produce several vaccines in less than a year, and EU solidarity had ensured that poorer countries of the bloc received their first doses.He took aim at the “highly publicised” supply of vaccines by China and Russia to other countries.“We should not let ourselves be misled by China and Russia, both regimes with less desirable values than ours, as they organise highly limited but widely publicised operations to supply vaccines to others.” Michel also noted that China and Russia had both vaccinated fewer people at home than the EU.“Europe will not use vaccines for propaganda purposes. We promote our values,” he said.Michel also defended a system to control the export of doses produced in EU countries, invoked by Italy last week to block a shipment of AstraZeneca shots to Australia.“Our objective: to prevent companies from which we have ordered and pre-financed doses from exporting them to other advanced countries when they have not delivered to us what was promised,” Michel said. “The EU has never stopped exporting.”He said the EU would become the world’s leading vaccine producer in the coming months and was the best equipped to adapt vaccine output quickly to virus mutations.Tensions have increased between London and Brussels following the completion of Britain’s exit from the EU at the end of 2020.Relations strained by years of bruising talks over Brexit took a turn for the worse in January when the EU briefly threatened to use emergency measures to stop coronavirus vaccines going from the bloc into Northern Ireland, a British-ruled province bordering EU member state Ireland.",Reuters

Trump’s hardline policy was popular among the large Cuban-American population in south Florida, helping him win the state in November though he lost the election.Eighty U.S. House of Representatives Democrats urged Biden in a March 3 letter to repeal Trump’s “cruel” sanctions on Cuba and renew engagement.Psaki said one of the guiding principles for Cuba policy would be support for democracy and human rights. She also said “Americans, especially Cuban Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom and prosperity in Cuba.”Biden’s advisers previously suggested he could start by loosening up remittances from Cuban Americans and easing restrictions on family travel. But the White House has indicated that such steps may not be coming anytime soon.(This story refiles to insert dropped words in paragraph 4)",Reuters

The Pentagon is carrying out a review of its strategy in the region.“A wider base of long-range precision fires, which are enabled by all our terrestrial forces - not just sea and air but by land forces as well - is critically important to stabilize what is becoming a more unstable environment in the western Pacific,” Admiral Phil Davidson, commander for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.Davidson cited enthusiasm by the Army and Marine Corps “to embrace some of the capabilities that the Navy and Air Force have already developed.”A budget document provided to Congress last month by the Indo-Pacific Command said the United States needed increased ground-based weapons along the first island chain, which would cost $408 million in fiscal year 2022 alone and $2.9 billion from fiscal years 2023 to 2027.The first island chain is the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago, through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China’s coastal seas.While the United States has been able to use long-range weapons on ships and aircraft, there were limits placed on it because of an arms control treaty.But the United States pulled out of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia in 2019.While the Pentagon has said it was in favor of placing such missiles in the region, allies in Asia have so far appeared to be opposed to the idea of hosting them.Davidson said, however, that missile defense was not enough to deter a potential adversary.“Missile defense is the hardest thing to do. And if I’m the manager of a baseball team, if I can have the best defenses in the world but if I can’t score some runs, I can’t win the game,” Davidson said.",Reuters

Some banners read “Cops out of our neighbourhoods”.Police later fired tear gas to disperse groups of masked protesters who broke away from the march and hurled petrol bombs, rocks and other objects at them, setting garbage containers alight.During the clashes, a Reuters photographer saw a group of protesters attacking one officer, leaving him lying on the ground, with his head bloodied.As the clashes continued through the evening, at least three police were hurt and 10 arrests were made, police said.Many protests turn violent in Greece, which is emerging from a decade-long financial and social crisis and has been criticised by human rights groups for the actions of law enforcers.The incident shown in the amateur video was condemned by opposition parties. Authorities are investigating the use of force by police, who said they had been called out to check if lockdown rules were being respected.An ombudsman looking into the case said this week that complaints of police brutality had been on the increase, as frustration grows with the restrictions on movement and economic activity necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic.In a brief televised statement, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the violence seen on Tuesday must end.Referring to the injured policeman, he called for restraint: “I am addressing young people, who are destined to create and not to destroy.

I think it’s pretty secure, but there’s no denying that this is a meaningful blow and a difficult crisis for them to navigate.”Plotting a path out of the crisis will fall to Elizabeth, 94, her son and heir Prince Charles, 72, and his eldest son Prince William, 38, plus a small group of advisers such as the queen’s private secretary Edward Young, 54, and Charles’ private secretary Clive Alderton, 53.Ultimately the final decision will rest with Elizabeth - effectively chairman of “the Firm” - with input from Charles and William, though they will also have guidance from advisers and could consult Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Those top three royals gathered at Sandringham, the monarch’s country retreat, in early 2020 to hash out a possible compromise for Harry and Meghan as they stepped back from official duties.Around 40 hours after the interview aired, Elizabeth issued a statement to say the royals were saddened by the challenging experiences of Harry and Meghan and promised to privately address revelations about a racist remark about their son.Throughout its history, the monarchy has had to cope with wars, revolution and civil strife. But in the last century, the greatest threat has come from within its own ranks.The abdication crisis unexpectedly propelled George VI, a shy man who had a stammer, onto the throne in a turn of events which ultimately led to his daughter Elizabeth II, now 94, becoming queen, a role she has held for a record 69 years.During that time, the greatest existential threat came in the tumult of the 1990s, when the institution struggled to cope with scandals and wrecked marriages, not least that of Charles to the late Diana.After the death of Diana, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair convinced Charles to persuade the queen to come to London to be seen to address the nation, though there were tensions then between the PM’s team and the Palace’s advisers.Blair felt the Palace had been slow to respond and parachuted his own PR chief in to help it deal with the crisis.There are concerns the monarchy is again being pushed to the precipice - this time due to accusations of racism and neglect by Meghan and Harry, the sixth-in-line to the throne and younger brother of future king, William.“The royal family has faced far greater challenges in its existence and although front pages are fulminating with the hype that this is the greatest crisis that’s hit the royal family, that’s tosh,” Mark Borkowski, one of Britain’s leading public relations experts, told Reuters.Novelist Hilary Mantel, whose trilogy about the court of Tudor King Henry VIII garnered two Booker prizes, likened the royal family to pandas, “expensive to conserve and ill-adapted to any modern environment”.“But aren’t they interesting? Aren’t they nice to look at?” Mantel wrote in a 2013 essay. “Some people find them endearing; some pity them for their precarious situation; everybody stares at them, and however airy the enclosure they inhabit, it’s still a cage.”Harry admitted he had felt confined.“I was trapped but I didn’t know I was trapped,” he said. “Trapped within the system, like the rest of my family are. My father and my brother, they’re trapped. They don’t get to leave and I have huge compassion for that.”Polls show the British public overwhelmingly support the queen, and even republicans admit there is absolutely no prospect of any constitutional upheaval while Elizabeth is monarch.But approval for Charles - who Harry said he felt had let him down - is much lower.The furore comes in the midst of a “culture war”, often portrayed as a rift between an older generation wishing to protect Britain’s history and heritage from a “woke” youth, who see their elders as blocking moves to end racial and social injustice.A snap survey carried out after the interview indicated that the British public’s sympathies lay more with the queen and other royal family members than with Harry and Meghan, but were split on whether the couple had been treated unfairly, with younger people tending to take the couple’s side while those over 65 did not.Borkowski said the generation who grew up when Elizabeth came to the throne were dying out and the monarchy had to think about its future.“This throws up many, many questions that need to be answered because of what Meghan and Harry have unveiled by opening up some wounds and pitching a battle in the heat of the culture wars,” he said.",Reuters

Glasgow is the last, best opportunity that we have and the best hope that the world will come together and build on Paris,” Kerry said, referring to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.“Scientists tell us this decade, 2020 to 2030, must be the decade of action,” the former U.S. Secretary of State added.Nearly 200 countries committed under the Paris Agreement to halt the increase in global temperatures to levels that would avoid the worst impacts of climate change.However, most large emitters are not living up to that goal.On Tuesday, Kerry and Timmermans discussed how the United States and the EU - the world’s second and third-largest emitters of greenhouse gases - can convince other big polluters to make tougher emissions-cutting pledges in time for the U.N. summit in November.China last week announced a five-year plan that analysts said would see its emissions rise. India, Japan, Russia and Brazil are all under pressure to commit to faster emissions cuts.In a joint statement later on Tuesday, the United States and EU pledged to renew their alliance on fighting climate change and cooperate with global partners “to strengthen their climate ambition.”The EU has already upgraded its pledge. The EU’s 27 member countries agreed in December to cut their net greenhouse gas emissions at least 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.The United States is due to announce its own pledge next month. EU officials and environmental groups are seeking a commitment from Washington to reduce emissions at least 50% this decade below 2005 levels.“If it doesn’t start with a 5, we don’t consider that good,” an EU diplomat said of the U.S. pledge, referring to an emissions cut by 2030 against 2005 levels.",Reuters

He wants it to be very big and he feels that this is the key to the recovery package.”Graves said the infrastructure plan must be bipartisan and that a funding mechanism was needed.“It cannot be a ‘my way or the highway’ approach like last Congress,” Graves said, referring to previous Democratic legislation. “A highway bill cannot grow into a multi-trillion dollar catch-all bill, or it will lose Republican support.”Biden last month met with a bipartisan groups of senators on infrastructure.Democrats narrowly control both the House and Senate. Biden’s Republican predecessor Donald Trump failed to agree with lawmakers on a major bill to repair and replace aging and dangerous bridges, airports, water pipes and other projects.As a presidential candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion in fixing highways, bridges and airports; building climate-resilient homes; wiring cities for broadband internet; and encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing electric vehicle charging stations.",Reuters

Some of them are expected to challenge Republican incumbents.A civil war has erupted within the Republican Party, with establishment figures such as Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell eager to put Trump in the rearview mirror, and others, like Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham, believing the party’s future depends on the energy of the pro-Trump base.Trump has waged a war of words with establishment Republicans, some of whom he feels betrayed him by joining Democrats in impeaching him.Trump, now living at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, dangled the possibility of running for president again in 2024 when he addressed a conference of conservatives last Sunday.In that speech, he singled out Republicans Senators Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey and House lawmakers Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, suggesting he would support candidates who opposed them in Republican primaries.Still, Trump has committed to helping Republicans try to win control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate in 2022 congressional elections that will be a first referendum on the leadership of Democratic President Joe Biden.",Reuters
64,Exclusive: Georgia prosecutor probing Trump taps leading racketeering attorney,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-georgia-racketeering-exc/exclusive-georgia-prosecutor-probing-trump-taps-leading-racketeering-attorney-idUSKBN2AY0L0,"(Reuters) - The district attorney investigating whether former U.S. President Donald Trump illegally interfered with Georgia’s 2020 election has hired an outside lawyer who is a national authority on racketeering, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has enlisted the help of Atlanta lawyer John Floyd, who wrote a national guide on prosecuting state racketeering cases. Floyd was hired recently to “provide help as needed” on matters involving racketeering, including the Trump investigation and other cases, said the source, who has direct knowledge of the situation.The move bolsters the team investigating Trump as Willis prepares to issue subpoenas for evidence on whether the former president and his allies broke the law in their campaign to pressure state officials to reverse his Georgia election loss. Willis has said that her office would examine potential charges including “solicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering” among other possible violations.A representative for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.Floyd’s appointment signals that racketeering could feature prominently in the investigation. It’s an area of law where Willis has extensive experience - including a high-profile Atlanta case where she won racketeering convictions of 11 public educators for a scheme to cheat on standardized tests.The investigation of Trump focuses in part on his phone call to Georgia’s secretary of state, asking the secretary to “find” the votes needed to overturn Trump’s election loss, based on false voter-fraud claims.Willis - a Democrat who in January became the county’s first Black woman district attorney - will have to navigate a fraught political landscape. She faces pressure from Democrats in Atlanta and nationally to pursue an aggressive prosecution, along with scrutiny from Republicans in a state historically dominated by that party.Floyd declined to comment when asked about the appointment but spoke to Reuters about his past experiences working with Willis.In 2014, when Willis was an assistant district attorney in Atlanta, Floyd was brought in as a special prosecutor for the racketeering case that grew out of the schools cheating scandal.“It was very much a team effort,” Floyd said of working with Willis.The cheating case could provide clues to her strategy for investigating Trump, legal experts say, while stressing that the probe is still in its early stages.If she pursues racketeering charges, Willis will need to prove a pattern of corruption by Trump, alone or with his allies, aimed at overturning the election results to stay in power. While racketeering is typically pursued by prosecutors in cases involving such crimes as murder, kidnapping, and bribery, the Georgia statute defines racketeering more broadly to include false statements made to state officials.The federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was originally passed in 1970 to help tie Mafia bosses to the crimes of their underlings by allowing prosecutors to argue they conspired together in a “criminal enterprise.” Over the years, however, its reach has grown to include businesses and other organizations as enterprises subject to the law.Willis specifically listed racketeering and lying to public officials in detailing the possible crimes her office intended to investigate in a Feb. 10 letter to four Republican state officials, asking them to preserve records related to the case.“That letter was really a signal to the public that she was going after a number of possibilities,” said Clark Cunningham, a Georgia State University law professor.Georgia lawyers familiar with the state RICO law said Willis may be considering whether it would apply to alleged false statements made by Trump and his allies as they sought to influence state officials to reverse his election loss.“It’s not a stretch to see where she’s taking this,” said Cathy Cox, the dean of Mercer University’s law school in Macon, Georgia and a former Georgia secretary of state. “If Donald Trump engaged in two or more acts that involve false statements - that were made knowingly and willfully in an attempt to falsify material fact, like the election results - then you can piece together a violation of the racketeering act.”Racketeering, a felony in Georgia, can carry stiff penalties including up to 20 years in prison and a hefty fine. “There are not a lot of people who avoid serving prison time on a racketeering offense,” said Cox.‘FIND’ THE VOTESIn a Jan. 2 phone call, Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to “find” just enough votes to allow him to win. In the hour-long call, Trump repeated false voter-fraud claims, insisting he won Georgia by a landslide and that Democrat Joe Biden received thousands of votes from people who were out-of-state, unregistered, or dead. Trump made another phone call in late December to Georgia’s chief elections investigator, urging the official to “find the fraud.”On Dec. 5, Trump called the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to urge him to hold a special session of the legislature to overturn the election results. Three days later, Trump called Georgia’s Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, warning him not to interfere with a Texas lawsuit that challenged the election results in Georgia and other states.Carr stated publicly that he opposed the Texas lawsuit. The offices of Kemp and Carr did not respond to requests for comment for this story.Willis’ office has indicated it is also examining efforts to influence the election by Trump’s allies, including a November phone call made by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham to Raffensperger to discuss mail-in ballots; false election fraud claims made by Trump’s then personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in testimony at state legislative hearings; and the abrupt removal of Byung J. “BJay” Pak, a U.S. attorney in Georgia who angered Trump by not doing enough to investigate his unfounded fraud claims.Legal experts say prosecutors could use the pattern of false statements in a pressure campaign to build a RICO case, but that Willis would face the burden of proving Trump knew his fraud allegations were false. In a trial, Trump could argue that he did not deliberately break the law because he truly believed he had been cheated, said Kurt Kastorf, an Atlanta attorney and former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor.“Trump’s lawyers could reasonably point to portions of the call with the Secretary of State where Trump seems to be making clear that the reason they need to do something is because there is fraud in the election,” he said. “Prosecutors would need to respond with evidence that this asserted reason is insincere.”As an assistant district attorney in Atlanta, Willis employed the state’s racketeering statute in the complex test-cheating case - leading to a six-month trial, the longest in Georgia history.Willis led a team of prosecutors in laying out the case that educators had operated a criminal enterprise within the public school system in a conspiracy to cheat, winning convictions in April 2015. Willis and her team walked jurors through months of testimony in the intricate case, which accused 12 former teachers, principals and administrators of inflating scores on standardized tests to secure promotions and cash bonuses. Eleven were convicted; some got prison time.“I’ve worked on some pretty intense cases over the years,” said Floyd, the RICO expert. “But as far as duration and complexity, that would be hard to match.”As a private attorney, Floyd is widely respected in legal circles for his expertise and experience litigating complex RICO cases. In addition to the cheating case, he helped convict a former sheriff of Georgia’s DeKalb County for ordering the murder of his elected successor. Floyd successfully defended the conviction, which included racketeering offenses, all the way to Georgia’s Supreme Court.Anti-racketeering laws are a powerful tool for prosecutors, but building a successful case requires meeting a complex set of legal requirements, according to Floyd, who wrote the book, “RICO State by State: A Guide to Litigation Under the State Racketeering Statutes.”In 1985, he joined the Atlanta law firm Bondurant Mixson & Elmore LLP, where he still works. Prior to joining the firm, Floyd clerked for a federal judge where he was introduced to RICO cases. “I worked on a few of them there, and my interest grew,” Floyd said.",Reuters

Ponsati said they had strong legal grounds.“It’s a sad day for the European Parliament. We have lost our immunity, but the European Parliament has lost even more than that, as a result it has also lost European democracy,” Puigdemont said.Puigdemont and Comin, who are in self-imposed exile in Belgium, formally became members of the European Parliament in June 2019, while Ponsati, who is in Scotland, was officially a member from January 2020.All are subject to European arrest warrants issued by Spain which is seeking their extradition related to their role in organising a 2017 independence referendum deemed illegal by a Spanish court.The referendum brought on Spain’s biggest political crisis in decades and was followed by a unilateral declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament in October 2017, which prompted the central government to impose direct rule from Madrid and authorities to arrest separatist leaders.Nine of them were convicted in Spain of the same charge of sedition in 2019 and sentenced to up to 13 years in prison.Belgium has so far denied Spain’s extradition requests. A court in January refused to extradite Lluis Puig, another separatist former member of the Catalan government living in Belgium, over charges of misuse of public funds.Puigdemont has also been charged with misuse of public funds.Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said the parliament’s decision was a sign of “respect for the work of the Spanish justice system”. A European lawmaker cannot use his position to “protect himself from appearing in a national court,” she said.“Problems in Catalonia are solved in Spain, not in Europe,” she said, defending a solution through dialogue.Puigdemont’s party, Junts, tweeted that the conflict had stopped being an internal affair.“We have brought it to the heart of Europe to continue denouncing the repression and political persecution of the Spanish state,” it said.The European Parliament said the events pre-dated their election and it was for national judicial systems of EU countries to determine criminal proceedings.",Reuters

True figures are likely far higher due to under-reporting of sexual abuse, a heavily-stigmatised crime.“These numbers are very shocking and really are sort of a wake-up call for governments to be doing much more to prevent this violence,” report author Claudia Garcia-Moreno said.In some regions, more than half of women face violence at some point, she told Reuters, citing Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia.Countries with the highest prevalence include Kiribati, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Afghanistan, WHO data show.The lowest rates are in Europe, up to 23%, over a lifetime.Violence starts at an “alarmingly young” age, the WHO said.One in four adolescent girls aged 15-19 who have had a relationship have been subjected to either physical or sexual violence, Garcia-Moreno said.“This is a very important and formative time in life. And we know that the impacts of this violence can be long-lasting and can affect physical and mental health and lead to unwanted pregnancies and other complications,” she said.",Reuters

Are you able to teach your children? If a child gets sick, can you admit them to hospital? Can you buy them medicine ... There is no education, no jobs, the dollar is at 10,000 (Lebanese pounds) and we are staying at home, dying slowly,” protester Fadi Nader said.Groups of protesters have been burning tyres daily to block roads since the Lebanese currency tumbled to a new low last week, deepening popular anger over Lebanon’s financial collapse.Three people died in car accidents amidst the roadblocks on Monday, local media reported.Local television aired a funeral in Zgharta in north Lebanon for two young men who died when they drove into a truck that was parked across a road to block traffic.“Every person in this country has to shoulder responsibility. Let protesters go to the houses of the leaders and their palaces, not block roads,” the priest conducting the funeral told the gathering.The incident prompted Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, the country’s top Christian cleric, to caution against chaotic road blocks.“We are sorry that all of this has to happen, the people are angry and the youth are angry. We are with them, but we should not punish people on the road.

He did not provide details.It is the latest indication that some companies could press ahead with plans without waiting for the European Union’s regulator -- the European Medicines Agency (EMA) -- to grant its approval to Sputnik V.Scientists said the Russian vaccine was almost 92% effective, based on peer-reviewed late-stage trial results published in The Lancet medical journal last month.Sputnik V has already been approved or is being assessed for approval in three EU member states - Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. EU officials have said Brussels could start negotiations about a possible agreement to buy vaccines if at least four members request it.The Italian-Russian chamber of commerce said on Monday that the Italian move paved the way for the creation of the first Sputnik V production facility in Europe outside Russia.It said there were plans for Italian production to begin in June and that it hoped that 10 million doses of Sputnik V could be produced there by the end of the year.“This agreement is the first of its kind with a European partner,” Vincenzo Trani, head of the chamber, said in the statement. “It can be called a historic event, which is proof of the good state of relations between our countries and shows that Italian companies can see beyond political differences.”The Lugano-based Adienne Pharma & Biotech did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RDIF declined to provide further detail on the deal beyond confirming it.The Italian industry ministry has played no role in the deal between RDIF and Adienne, a government source said, adding the ministry had not even been informed of the operation, which is “legitimate” and “in line with market dynamics”.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Italy-related plan could help quickly satisfy demand for the shot abroad.An EMA official urged EU members last week to refrain from approving Sputnik V at the national level while the agency was still reviewing it, prompting the vaccine’s developers to demand a public apology.Peskov called the EMA official’s comment “inappropriate at the very least”.A spokesman for Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Rome was not applying particular pressure on the EU to secure the approval of Sputnik V. He said Draghi had urged the bloc to pursue all possible options to secure vaccines approved by the EMA.",Reuters

Libya's designated interim prime minister, Abdulhamid Dbeibeh, urged the long-divided parliament on Tuesday to back his proposed unity government as it prepared for a confidence vote expected on Wednesday.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security/libya-pm-addresses-parliament-as-government-vote-looms-idUSKBN2B12F4,"SIRTE, Libya (Reuters) - Libya’s designated interim prime minister, Abdulhamid Dbeibeh, urged the long-divided parliament on Tuesday to back his proposed unity government as it prepared for a confidence vote expected on Wednesday.The parliament, which split between western and eastern factions along with most state institutions as the country fractured soon after a 2014 election, is meeting for the first time in years for the session in the frontline city of Sirte.Though the U.N.-backed process appears to offer the clearest path in years to end Libya’s decade of chaos and violence, it has also been dogged by allegations of corruption, influence peddling and the presence of foreign mercenaries.Meanwhile, Dbeibeh’s 35-member cabinet list, distributed over the weekend after weeks of intense negotiating to keep all Libya’s varied factions on board, was still being amended on Tuesday, he said.Parliament spokesman Abdullah Belhaq said a final cabinet list would be presented to the parliament on Wednesday for a vote.The session is taking place in Sirte’s Ouagadougou Conference Centre, built by Muammar Gaddafi as a glossy gift to his hometown but damaged in fighting after his downfall and used by Islamic State when it ruled the city in 2015.This year it has functioned as headquarters of a military formed by Libya’s two main warring sides and the rival administrations they back to oversee their ceasefire.The Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations, last year repulsed a 14-month assault on the capital by Khalifa Haftar’s eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), leading to the truce.Addressing parliament, Dbeibeh decried the continued presence of mercenaries and other foreign forces in Libya and said his government’s goals of unifying state institutions and holding an election planned for Dec. 24, if realised, would be big achievements.Both those ends were written into the mandate for his interim unity government by 75 delegates convened by the United Nations in meetings in Tunis and Geneva to plot a path to elections.However, the process, in which delegates voted on rival leadership candidates, led to allegations of vote buying. The issue was not raised in Tuesday’s parliament session.",Reuters
71,"Analysis: Lula’s revival suits Bolsonaro, but Brazil 2022 is a different match
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva first ran for president in 1989.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-politics-lula-bolsonaro-analys/analysis-lulas-revival-suits-bolsonaro-but-brazil-2022-is-a-different-match-idUSKBN2B12D1,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva first ran for president in 1989.Three decades later, the gravelly-voiced former union leader looks set for one more run at Brazil’s top job after a Supreme Court judge quashed his convictions and restored his political rights.His resurrection from the political ashes sets the stage for a déjà-vu election next year, pitting him against far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and giving voters a choice between the most polarizing figures on Brazil’s political spectrum.“This changes the whole picture,” said Creomar de Souza, founder of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy in Brasilia. “It’s obviously still very early, but this strangles any momentum for a more moderate centrist candidate.”That should suit Bolsonaro just fine.The former army captain won in 2018 with vows to expunge the leftist legacy of Lula’s Workers Party, which led Latin America’s largest economy from 2003 to 2016.Bolsonaro’s rhetoric was simple, angry and very effective: The left was rushing Brazil on a one-way street to the same ruin as Venezuela, he warned. Politics in the capital Brasilia was rotten to the core. The country needed an unvarnished right-wing outsider like himself, with no links to major political parties.But as former U.S. President Donald Trump’s failed re-election effort showed, it is harder to win on a drain-the-swamp platform when you’ve spent four years in charge of the swamp.Brazil is hurting, with a quarter million lost to COVID-19, an economy in worse shape than when Bolsonaro took over and anti-corruption operations dismantled. It is not clear if popular anger towards the Workers Party remains what it was in 2018.Even as he will leap at the chance to rail against the left’s past mistakes, Bolsonaro cannot escape being judged on his own performance.“Bolsonaro today doesn’t have much to show for his presidency,” said Leonardo Barreto, director at political consultancy Vector in Brasilia. “The government has to show results to keep Bolsonaro in power. This is more important than the presence or absence of Lula in the presidential race.”For Barreto and many other political analysts, that means Bolsonaro may pursue an increasingly populist agenda to shore up support. Promises of economic reforms, which won Bolsonaro supporters from the financial community, will be shelved.Financial markets reacted to the prospect of a further populist shift. Brazil’s real, already the world’s worst-performing currency against the dollar this year after the Libyan dinar and Sudanese pound, slumped to within 10 cents of its all-time low in May last year. [L8N2L74KZ]There is also the question of which Lula decides to run. His remarkable longevity is a testament to a knack for reinvention.Will 2022 see a return of the leftist firebrand, who made his name stumping on factory floors in the 1980s, or the deal-making unifier that swapped blood-red T-shirts for tailored suits as he calmed markets after a landslide victory in 2002.It is too soon for firm conclusions, but voter surveys suggest Lula has a good shot, currently polling ahead of Bolsonaro.Speaking to Reuters in September, Lula joked that he had “the energy of a 30-year-old and the political drive of a 20-year-old.”It is, however, the shrewd experience of a 75-year-old lifetime politician that Bolsonaro should be most wary of.“It’s a different game from 2018,” said Carlos Melo, a politics professor at the Insper Institute in Sao Paulo. “We’ll have to see which way Lula goes.”",Reuters

They also tore down a section of a 10-foot-tall barricade guarding the national palace.“It was evident that they wanted to vandalize the national palace,” Lopez Obrador said. “If the wall had not been put up, many people would have been put at risk.”While the demonstrations were smaller than last year, thousands of mostly female protesters dressed in purple marched in Mexico City, spray-painting streets with messages accusing the government of not doing enough to prosecute femicides.Marches last year also at times boiled over into violence, which some activists have described as a cry to emphasize the gravity of crimes against women.Of the almost entirely female police force at the marches, 62 officers were injured and nine of them hospitalized, with injuries ranging from bruises to a clavicle fracture, said Marcela Figueroa, a deputy secretary in Mexico City’s public safety ministry.Nineteen civilians were injured, and one of them also hospitalized, Figueroa said on Twitter.

76,'No sense of job security': Amazon union organizers tell lawmakers in Alabama,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-amazon-labor/no-sense-of-job-security-amazon-union-organizers-tell-lawmakers-in-alabama-idUSKBN2AX19K,"(Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers visited an Amazon facility in Alabama on Friday to lend support to a growing push to unionize its workers, in what labor leaders and lawmakers called one of the most important union elections in United States history.Workers at the Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, are voting on whether to become the first employees in the U.S. to join a union at one of the country’s largest employers.The visit comes on the heels of President Joe Biden’s recent statement defending workers’ rights to form unions. While he did not mention Amazon, he referenced “workers in Alabama.”The move by the Alabama workers, which is being backed by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), is a critical one for the U.S. labor movement that has struggled with declining membership in recent years. It is also a watershed moment for a growing unionizing drive within the tech industry that has long been hostile to organized labor.The congressional delegation includes U.S. Representatives Andy Levin, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Terri Sewell, and Nikema Williams.“This is the most important election for the working class of this country in the 21st century,” Rep. Levin said, addressing workers in Bessemer. “This is the biggest election in the south in a generation.”Rep. Sewell, whose district includes Bessemer, likened the fight to the civil rights struggles in the area’s past.“I know that Amazon workers stand in the same tradition as John Lewis...as those foot soldiers that dare to change the world by having the audacity to stand up for their rights.”Bowman went a step further and urged Amazon workers around the country to pay attention to their working conditions.The lawmakers also privately met with workers and organizers from the facility.“We just want what’s owed to us,” said Kevin Jackson, an Amazon worker at the Bessemer warehouse who attended the meetings. “We want a seat at the table.”Michael Foster, a lead RWDSU organizer, said workers at the facility reached out to the union for help, not the other way around. “We know we have people walking on egg shells because they have no sense of job security,” he said.Amazon spokeswoman Heather Knox said she does not believe the RWDSU represents the majority of employees’ views and that Amazon offered “some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.”Knox also said the company hopes “these members of Congress will spend this same amount of energy on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour —as Amazon did for all of our employees in 2018.”The vote could also help kickstart a new chapter for the labor movement in the southern states, where unions have long struggled to gain a foothold, labor experts said.One of the main reasons for this has been fewer job opportunities in the region and political hostility toward unions, said William Gould, a labor law expert at Stanford Law. Gould is also a former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).“But that is changing because of how companies such as Amazon have really tested the limits of workers’ endurance,” he said, adding that the pandemic had exacerbated existing health and safety issues.Bessemer, which is about 15 miles (24 km) away from Birmingham, the most populous city in the state, is majority African American - a fact that has also made the fight an important one for several lawmakers.Levin separately told Reuters Amazon’s policies are “egregious”, especially those such as “trying to force an in-person election in a pandemic hotspot.”The NLRB decided on Jan. 15 to not allow in-person voting due to safety concerns during the pandemic. Earlier this month, close to 6,000 workers began voting by mail on whether to join the union.Amazon spokeswoman Knox maintained that “Amazon proposed a safe on-site election process validated by COVID-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already-scheduled shifts.”",Reuters
77,Civil rights groups urge companies to join fight against Georgia voting restrictions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-georgia/civil-rights-groups-urge-companies-to-join-fight-against-georgia-voting-restrictions-idUSKBN2AX19A,"(Reuters) - Voting rights groups are calling on companies such as Coca-Cola Co and Delta Air Lines Inc to oppose efforts by Republican lawmakers in Georgia to enact sweeping new restrictions on voting access in the battleground state.The organizations, including the Black Voters Matter Fund, the New Georgia Project Action Fund and the Georgia NAACP, launched a campaign on social media and in local news outlets this week asking the corporations to take a stand against legislation they said aims to curb turnout from Democratic-leaning Black voters.Black voters were crucial to helping elect Democrat President Joe Biden in the November election and two Democratic senators in a January run-off in Georgia, a once unthinkable scenario in the traditionally Republican southern state.“Some of these companies have made beautiful statements for Black Lives Matter,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group focused on increasing Black Americans’ voting access. “Yet here, in the moment where it matters most, they have been silent.”Republicans in Georgia and across the country are using former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity.Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court this week to uphold voting restrictions in Arizona in a case that could further hobble the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting.They also opposed an election reform bill passed on Wednesday by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. The For the People Act, the most comprehensive voting bill since the 1965 act, faces long odds in the Senate, with Republicans saying it fails to do enough to combat fraud.In Georgia, likely one of the biggest battlegrounds in the 2022 elections with a U.S. Senate seat and the governor’s office on the ballot, Republican state lawmakers sponsoring the voting measures maintain they are meant to safeguard elections.A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House on Monday would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches.Some voting rights groups have increased their focus on corporations based in Georgia after Popular Information, an online politics newsletter run by Judd Legum, a former aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton, cited campaign finance records popular.info/p/georgia showing the companies had donated around $7.4 million since 2018 to politicians sponsoring the voting legislation.The groups took out several full-page ads in local newspapers urging Delta, Coca-Cola, Southern Company, Home Depot Inc, United Parcel Service Inc and Aflac Inc to stop the donations and support federal voting rights reform.Albright said the groups will encourage Georgia residents to call the companies and that protests could be organized in front of their offices.In statements to Reuters, Coca-Cola, UPS, Delta, Home Depot and Aflac said they were committed to voter rights but did not provide specifics about their stance on the Georgia bills or their future political donations.Coca-Cola said it paused political donations in January, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The company added that it supported efforts to “help facilitate a balanced approach” to the voting bills. Aflac also said it paused all political donations in January.Delta said it had not made any individual contributions to Georgia House or Senate candidates in 2020.UPS and Coca-Cola said they were working with local commerce chambers on voting rights issues. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce did not comment on ongoing talks, referring Reuters to a Feb. 16 statement in which the group said it believed it should be “easy to vote, hard to commit fraud.”Southern Company declined to comment.U.S. companies in general are becoming more reticent about the exposure that comes with political donations, said Donald Green, a political science professor at Columbia University.“This will give them yet another excuse to back away from that type of contribution,” Green said.Georgia’s Republican Party did not respond to a request for comment on voting rights groups’ efforts to enlist companies’ help in fighting the bills.The Georgia proposals have drawn scrutiny from More Than A Vote, a voter rights organization founded last year by NBA star LeBron James and other athletes to expand Black voter turnout and fight systemic racism in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.The group is kicking off a new campaign to fight efforts to restrict voting access. It will start by running a 30-second advertisement narrated by James during the televised NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta on Sunday.",Reuters

The cause of death was not clear.In a Facebook live broadcast before he was detained, Zaw Myat Linn urged people to continue fighting the army, “even if it costs our lives.”“Their power must never last,” he said.Neither the military nor the police responded to calls for comment.Zaw Myat Linn is the second NLD official to have died in custody in the last two days. Khin Maung Latt, who had worked as a campaign manager for an NLD MP elected in 2020, died after he was arrested on Saturday night.More than 1,900 people have been arrested across the country since the coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said.Police broke up scattered demonstrations in Yangon - the former capital and still the commercial hub - and other towns across Myanmar with tear gas and stun grenades on Tuesday.As night fell, soldiers fired weapons in different districts of the coastal town of Dawei, while at least two people were wounded earlier in the day, one by a gunshot, in the town of Mohnyin in the north, local media said.Witnesses said two journalists from Kamayut, an independent media company, were arrested, while the military raided the offices of Mizzima News in Yangon.Live footage posted to social media also showed a raid after nightfall on the offices of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB).A day earlier, the junta stripped Mizzima, DVB, and three other outlets of their licences. They had all been active in covering protests against the coup.At least 35 journalists have been arrested since the Feb. 1 coup, Myanmar Now reported, of which 19 have been released.The U.S State Department said it “strongly condemned the junta for the... violent crackdowns on those peacefully taking to the streets and on those who are just doing their jobs, including independent journalists who have been swept up.”Daily protests against the coup are being staged across the country and security forces have cracked down harshly. More than 60 protesters have been killed and more than 1,800 detained, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), an advocacy group, has said.Overnight, police arrested about 50 people who had been cornered by security forces in a district of Yangon, a rights group said. But hundreds managed to escape the encirclement after crowds of demonstrators rallied in their support in defiance of a night-time curfew.Western powers and the United Nations had called on the military to allow the youths to leave the area in safety.Activist Shar Ya Mone said she had been in a building with about 15 to 20 others, but was able to get home after people gave our free car rides and welcomed protesters.She said she would keep demonstrating “until the dictatorship ends”.The army has justified the coup by saying that a November election won by the NLD was marred by fraud - a claim rejected by the electoral commission. It has promised a new election, but has not said when that might be held.International powers have condemned the takeover, which derailed a slow transition to democracy in a country that has been ruled by the military for long periods since independence from Britain in 1947.The junta said on Tuesday it was recalling its ambassador to Britain a day after he urged them in a statement to release Suu Kyi, state media reported.The MRTV news channel said Kyaw Swar Min, one of several ambassadors to publicly break from the military line, had released the statement without following orders.The military has brushed off condemnation of its actions, as it has in past periods of army rule when outbreaks of protest were bloodily repressed.It is also under pressure from a civil disobedience movement that has crippled government business and from strikes at banks, factories and shops that have shut much of Yangon this week.The European Union is preparing to widen its sanctions to target army-run businesses, according to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters.",Reuters

He began his hunger protest on Jan. 8 and suffered kidney failure last week.A leading member of the disbanded group November 17, he is serving multiple life terms for crimes including 13 murders - more than half the 23 killings the Marxist group says it carried out before its leaders were arrested in 2002.Koufodinas, who was once dubbed “Poison Hand” by some Greek media because of his deadly aim, says a government order for his transfer to Domokos in December was illegal. He wants to return to Korydallos prison in Athens, where other convicted members of November 17 are held.Greece’s top administrative court ruled that it did not have the authority to issue a temporary ruling freezing the transfer ordered by the state. It will examine in April whether that decision was legal, the semi-official Athens News Agency said.Authorities had previously rejected his request, citing a recent prison system reform and a rise in COVID-19 cases in the region where Korydallos prison is.Sympathisers and civil rights activists, including members of the leftist opposition, have staged protests against what they see as the intransigent and arbitrary stance taken by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ conservative government.Petrol bomb attacks against police and conservative politicians have also increased.Mitsotakis’ brother-in-law was among those killed by Koufodinas. The government says it will not yield to blackmail and that convicts cannot decide where they will serve their sentence.",Reuters

These came from small donations by Israel and Russia as well as 20,000 sent by the United Arab Emirates to Gaza.Meanwhile in Israel, restaurants reopened on Sunday as the country kept up a fast pace of mass vaccinations.“I brought millions of doses, now I’ll have to bring tens of millions of doses. I am currently in talks with Pfizer and Moderna to bring more,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel Army Radio, campaigning ahead of a March 23 election.Israel has given 53% of its 9 million population at least one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, according to Health Ministry data, and 38% have received both doses.The contrast has not gone unnoticed among Palestinians.On Monday, Israel extended its vaccination programme to include Palestinian labourers who work in Israel and in its West Bank settlements.Many Palestinians argue that Israel is neglecting its obligations as an occupying power by not including them in the mass roll-out.“The number of vaccinations in Israel is really high,” Saji Khalil, 75, told Reuters. “Even the Palestinian labourers whom they vaccinated, they did it to serve the Israeli community, not to look out for the well-being of the labourers.”Israeli officials say that under the 1990s Oslo interim peace accords, the Palestinian Authority is responsible for vaccinating its population.Many Palestinians are dissatisfied with their leaders. The PA came under fire from rights groups last week after admitting that it had sent 10% of the COVID-19 doses that it received to VIPs.Firas Narawesh, from Ramallah, said the government had failed to provide vaccinations to ordinary Palestinians, and had “distributed vaccinations in an unfair way and in an unequal way with clear favoritism and corruption.”",Reuters

This will help the EU meet its target of 300 million doses in the second quarter, even if some of the producers experience problems.Johnson & Johnson has told the European Union it was facing supply issues that may complicate plans to deliver 55 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine to the bloc in the second quarter of the year, an EU official told Reuters.“I learned that when you start to produce, it is a bumpy road. If I look at Johnson and Johnson I understand that they had some difficulties in the U.S., ...

I look forward to the committee and the Senate approving her nomination,” said Cassidy, in his introduction of Young to a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmation hearing.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats, including the Congressional Black Caucus, say that Young should replace Tanden as Biden’s nominee for director of the Office of Budget and Management.Tanden withdrew her nomination this week, after senators from both parties threatened not to vote for her because of her critical comments on Twitter.Young, who was the first Black woman to serve as the staff director for Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, could become the first Black woman to head the OMB.Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee wrote to Biden on Thursday urging him to nominate Young. “Shalanda Young has an impressive, lengthy record of hard work and smart budgeting across all of the federal departments and programs,” they wrote.The White House emphasized Thursday that Young wouldn’t automatically get the top job of gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget.Biden clearly thinks highly of Young and she would be acting director of the budget office if confirmed, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. However, she added, “There is a range of individuals in the country who are qualified for the job.”If Biden chooses another woman of color to head the Office of Management and Budget, and all remaining nominees are confirmed, his cabinet will be 46% female and 50% non-white, including Biden and Harris, according to Inclusive America, a non-profit that tracks diversity in government.",Reuters

The three cases involve New York City, San Francisco and various states including California and New York.Biden, a Democrat, has rescinded the Republican Trump’s 2017 executive order that called on U.S. agencies to withhold federal funds from the so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, many of which are governed by Democrats. Lower courts were divided on whether the policy was lawful.Trump’s 2017 order conditioned receipt of federal funds by state and local governments on their giving U.S. immigration officials access to their jails, and advance notice when immigrants in the country illegally are being released from custody. It was one element of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and his battles with Democrats.The new administration has moved to reverse course on various Trump policies coming before the Supreme Court.The court last month canceled oral arguments in two other cases after the Biden administration changed course from Trump. Both were appeals by Trump’s administration - one defending his funding of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and the other defending his “remain in Mexico” asylum policy.The administration also has asked the court to cancel an upcoming argument on a policy introduced under Trump backing work requirements for people who receive healthcare under the Medicaid program for the poor.The administration last month told the justices the Obamacare healthcare law should be upheld, reversing the position taken under Trump.",Reuters

Biden wants to revive the deal, which was agreed by Tehran and six major powers.Biden’s bid for diplomacy has been overshadowed in recent weeks by rocket attacks by Iran-backed militia on U.S. forces in Iraq that have triggered concerns about escalation.Kahl suggested he would favor strong responses to such attacks.“When Iran takes actions against our own forces, we should defend ourselves and punch back,” Kahl said.‘PROXY WAR’ Tensions in Kahl’s confirmation hearing echoed concerns raised on Wednesday, when a different Senate panel grilled Wendy Sherman over her nomination to be No. 2 official at the State Department. Sherman helped negotiate the 2015 Iran deal, and so is also likely to lose Republican votes.During Thursday’s hearing, Kahl defended his concerns about Trump’s 2018 pullout from the Iran deal and the decision to pile pressure on Tehran, including round after round of economic sanctions. Kahl at the time worried it would encourage Iran to increase its provocations and accelerate its nuclear program.“Both of those things have happened in the last three years. Iran is a lot closer to the fissile material required for a nuclear weapon than they were at the end of the Obama administration,” Kahl said. “And we’ve seen more attacks.”Republican Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa said she would not support Kahl’s nomination and that members of the U.S. military “deserve someone that will take a serious outlook to policy.” Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said Kahl’s hearing was being used by critics to re-litigate the 2015 agreement.“I really believe that the controversy over your nomination is essentially a proxy war,” Kaine said. “Republicans didn’t like the Iran deal.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton said Kahl had warned on Twitter of the risk of conflict with Iran after the Trump administration killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last year. He said Kahl had spent “the last four years warning about impending wars that never happened.”He also pointed to a tweet by Kahl describing Republicans as “the party of ethnic cleansing” after Trump abruptly ordered a Syria withdrawal in 2019 in a move that many said put at risk America’s Kurdish allies.Kahl apologized and said the last several years had been “pretty polarizing on social media.”“I’m sure there are times that I got swept up in that,” he said.",Reuters

No doubt the outgoing Chinese Ambassador to the UK stands by the 170+ pieces he was free to place in mainstream British media,” she tweeted, referring to Liu Xiaoming, who was based in Britain for around 11 years before leaving the country in January.Media has emerged as an area of tension in Sino-British ties.Beijing last month banned BBC World News from television networks in mainland China after finding it had “seriously violated” rules and undermined national unity.That came a week after Britain’s media regulator Ofcom barred Chinese state broadcaster CGTN from airing in the UK after it concluded that the Chinese Communist Party had ultimate editorial responsibility for the channel.The BBC has run a series of reports alleging human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region, which Beijing denies.Tensions with London also flared over an offer of a path to British citizenship for residents of the former British colony of Hong Kong following the imposition of a national security law cracking down on dissent.",Reuters

Do you want the army to stay on its feet or not? ... They don’t care.”The basic monthly salary of a soldier or policeman, which used to amount to around $800, is worth under $120 today. Budget cuts pushed the military to cut meat from its meals last year.In what was seen as a sign of the times, the French embassy donated food parcels last month to the Lebanese army, which has long been backed by Western nations.Some officials caution that security forces will struggle to contain unrest.More than half the population is now poor, with wages slashed across the board, prices soaring and no state rescue plan in sight. That was even before the currency hit a record low last week after months of political paralysis.The military, its commander and the caretaker interior minister have denied recent local media reports that economic hardship spurred a rise in forces abandoning duty.Still, three security sources told Reuters a buildup of pressure on lower-ranking servicemen has fueled concerns of desertions.One member of the security forces, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he wanted to leave after many years because it had become hard to pay rent. He said he knew three others who had deserted, which is punishable by law, and worried commanders would reject his request for a discharge.“If nothing works, I’ll have to resort to fleeing,” he said. “We’re ready to protect of course but...I used to buy my kids whatever they wanted. Now I can barely afford groceries.”A security source said army desertions were still within the usual pre-crisis figures, though there were plans to boost aid to avoid a rise.“We’re feeling the choke but we’re enduring.” He said a sense of national duty and bleak job prospects across Lebanon helped keep forces from wavering, but warned they should not “be pushed too far.”With the country on edge, unrest is expected to grow. Lebanese have burned tyres and shut main roads for a week since the currency hit its new low.A day after the president asked forces to open the roads, protesters still blocked highways leading out of Beirut on Tuesday.The economy’s collapse has brought a shift in robberies with more people trying to steal food, baby formula or medicine, a second security source said. There was also an uptick in gunmen holding up drivers at night to take cars, he said.In 2020, murders jumped 91% from 2019, according to research firm Information International, based on police data. Robberies shot up 57% and car thefts hit a nine-year high.A police spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.Road safety charity YASA said about 10,000 manhole covers had disappeared in Beirut, as thieves sell the cast iron for $100 each, more than Lebanon’s monthly minimum wage.Fears of muggings have pushed many to take precautions like avoiding ATMs at night. Eight people, including a designer and an engineer, said this had pushed them to buy a pistol.“If I had the money, I would have bought a licensed gun for the place,” said shop owner Khodr Osman. “There’s no safety today. The state is in disarray.”",Reuters

It says Poland has yet to repeal the annexe to its 2012-21 forest management plan that allows for the amount of logging to triple.Deputy Climate Minister Edward Siarka told a press conference in Bialowieza on Tuesday that signing the documents that allow for more logging did not violate the ECJ ruling.Siarka said the Commission took issue only with the proposed quota for one of the three forestry districts, and said that felling in the two other districts would not begin till the end of the breeding season for wild birds in the area. Felling would not occur in areas of forest that are more than 100 years old.The general director of State Forests, Andrzej Konieczny, said Tuesday’s move would help local communities to meet their heating needs, but Adam Bohdan of Wild Poland Foundation, an environmental NGO, slammed the decision.“We treat it as a spit in the face... We will try to convince important institutions to stop the logging,” he said.",Reuters

Although they appear not to have been followed by legislation to discriminate against gay residents, they have fuelled concern in Brussels and beyond of a drift in Poland towards illiberalism.“Polish authorities recently told me they were not able to schedule this visit, and that’s profoundly regrettable,” Beaune told L’Obs magazine in an interview.A spokeswoman for Beaune told Reuters the French minister planned to visit the town of Krasnik in the east, one of the 100 municipalities which signed the declaration, but that Polish authorities had indicated “it would be badly received to go to Krasnik considering the health situation.”However, the Polish government denied the French minister, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, had been denied access.“This is of course not true. No one in the Polish government forbade or made it impossible for the French deputy minister to visit Krasnik,” Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk tweeted on Tuesday.Critics, including the European Union, have accused the Law and Justice (PiS) government of backtracking on womens’ and LGBT rights and running a campaign laced with homophobic rhetoric in the run-up to last year’s presidential election.Franco-Polish relations have been cold for years, with Macron saying shortly after his election in 2017 that Polish citizens “deserve better” than a government at odds with the bloc’s democratic values.Beaune, a rising star in the French government who publicly came out as gay in December, said he had decided not to cancel the two-day trip to Poland despite not being able to fulfil a promise he made to visit the “LGBT-free zones” after his nomination last year. He met LGBT campaigners on the trip.“I could have gone to one of these zones without the Polish government’s authorisation, but in my view, that’s not how one should behave with an EU member state,” he said.Polish LGBT groups nevertheless took heart from Beaune’s stance.“It’s definitely a very important signal to all of us, a political signal to our community, that we aren’t alone. That foreign politicians are also looking at Poland and that they are our allies,” Bartosz Staszewski, an LGBT activist who met Beaune on Monday, told Reuters.",Reuters

Biden vowed to field a historically diverse team and has faced pressure from within his own ranks to live up to that promise in his administration’s early days.The new additions also come as the White House has been laying the groundwork for its second major spending bill, which it plans to unveil if it can shepherd Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill through congress this month. The Senate could vote on the bill as soon as this week.Meanwhile, on consumer protection issues, Biden has regularly turned to personnel like English whose views are aligned with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has advocated strict enforcement of the financial industry through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republican lawmakers largely regard the agency as too powerful and unaccountable.As a presidential candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion building climate-resilient homes, wiring cities for broadband internet, encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing electric vehicle charging stations, among other projects.He said the spending, paid for with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, would create millions of jobs for an economy reeling from the novel coronavirus pandemic while also shoring up the country’s resilience to climate change.Reynolds has studied topics including growing the domestic manufacturing base. Silverberg led the development of an $8 billion transit upgrade program at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.Biden and his transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, are expected to meet on Thursday afternoon with a bipartisan group of House of Representatives legislators on infrastructure.The White House has not specified how closely its legislative proposal will hew to the “Build Back Better” agenda Biden proposed as a candidate. Key decisions about the plan’s final cost and contents have not been finalized by his team, according to several people familiar with the plans.Infrastructure spending has backing in both parties. But Biden’s tax and spending plans have also drawn bipartisan push back.

His killing sparked weeks of nationwide and global protests, many of which were led by Black Lives Matter activists.“How many more people have to die, how many more people have to be brutalized on videotape” before police reforms become law, asked Democratic Representative Karen Bass, who wrote the legislation with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.The bill includes measures such as restricting certain funds to local governments that allow law enforcement officers to use choke holds, banning “no-knock warrants” that allow police officers to enter premises without announcing themselves and requiring law enforcement agencies to provide data on instances when police officers used deadly force.Bass said the bill would hold police “accountable” when constitutional rights are violated but would also support local law enforcement by fostering improvements in community policing, especially for minority neighborhoods.One of its most controversial provisions would change “qualified immunity” for police, further opening the door for lawsuits over the use of excessive force.Reuters in May 2020 published an investigation revealing how qualified immunity, with the Supreme Court’s continual refinements, had made it easier for police officers to kill or injure civilians with impunity.Conservative Republicans have attacked the Democratic bill, saying it would put law enforcement lives in danger and make communities less safe.The police reform effort sputtered in Congress last summer after the House passed the so-called George Floyd bill and Democrats blocked a Senate Republican bill.While the Republican bill also addressed issues such as police choke holds, no-knock warrants and use of police body cameras, Democrats complained it relied on incentives rather than mandating changes.Senator Tim Scott, the author of the Republican bill, told Reuters in a statement he welcomed conversations with Democrats over qualified immunity.",Reuters

It did so just hours after an interim court order banning the group’s removal, pending a legal bid by Amnesty International and Asylum Access to halt the plan amid fears there were asylum seekers and children among the group..The ruling by the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Tuesday paves the way for a full hearing on the deportations and extends a stay barring the removal of another 114 Myanmar nationals until the end of the judicial review.The progression of the legal case is unlikely to bring back those who have already been deported, but could allow similar challenges against future removals, New Sin Yew, a lawyer for the groups, told Reuters.“It’s a very important decision because it recognises the function of non-government organisations like Asylum Access and Amnesty International and their standing in bringing judicial review to hold the authorities accountable,” New said, as he detailed the court’s decision.The immigration department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the court ruling.The European Union and the United States have expressed concern the deportations went ahead despite the interim court order, while several Malaysian lawmakers have said the move could amount to contempt of court.Asylum Access Malaysia director Hui Ying Tham said the human rights groups had not yet decided whether to seek action against the government for contempt of court, but have asked authorities for more details on those deported.“We are actually trying to get more information ... as the deportation happened quite suddenly under very opaque circumstances,” she told a virtual news conference.Malaysia’s immigration department has said the returned group did not include Rohingya refugees or asylum seekers, but concerns have persisted as the U.N. refugee agency has been denied access to detainees for more than a year to verify their status.The rights groups in their court filing said three U.N.-registered people and 17 minors with at least one parent in Malaysia were on the deportee list.It was unclear if those individuals were sent back, though other refugee groups have said at least nine asylum-seekers and two unaccompanied children were among those already deported.Malaysia is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar, where the military seized power last month.",Reuters

The Kremlin doublespeak exploits Europe’s, and Germany’s commitment to dialogue,” the report said.Germany was among EU countries advocating for more sanctions on Russia over the case of Navalny, who received medical treatment in Berlin and recovered in the Black Forest after being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent last year.Navalny, an anti-corruption activist, says the Kremlin was behind the attack, which Moscow denies. He was arrested after returning to Moscow from Germany in January and is now serving a new jail sentence in a Russian penal colony.The EU last month agreed to blacklist four senior Russian officials over the Navalny case, adding to economic sanctions it had earlier slapped on Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin’s support of armed separatists in eastern Ukraine.EUvsDisinfo said Russia had depicted Germany as instrumental in driving the new sanctions that followed a trip by the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, to Moscow in February.While Borrell called for Navalny’s release, he also played up the need for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Russia in areas such as climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. During his visit, however, Moscow expelled four EU diplomats, including one from Germany.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany, has long been critical of Moscow’s human rights record, but Berlin has resisted U.S. pressure to block the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that would pump more Russian gas to Europe via Germany.EU leaders will discuss next steps in their troubled relationship with Russia at a summit on March 25-26.",Reuters

The ratio of cases to deaths will go right down as a result of vaccination, but not right down to zero, unfortunately,” Whitty told lawmakers.Schools in England re-opened to all pupils on Monday. The next steps in lockdown easing have been pencilled in at five-week intervals but officials have said that data, rather than dates, will dictate the pace.Asked why encouraging data couldn’t lead to an acceleration of that timetable, Vallance said three to four weeks were needed to generate and assess the data, and the government wanted to give one-week notice of changes to rules.“I think if you truncate that you are essentially flying blind,” Vallance said.",Reuters

His office rejects that.Shamdasani urged police to “take urgent measures to prevent the use of excessive force” and the government and security forces to “refrain from rhetoric that may lead to violations”.Shamdasani said an investigation must be “conducted with a view to accountability”.“The fact remains that most of the perpetrators of these human rights violations are enjoying impunity to this day,” she said.",Reuters

A 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, and more than 160,000 residents had to flee as radiation spewed into the air.After Chernobyl, people living close to the plant were exposed to radioactive iodine through contaminated milk. The Japanese authorities took more effective action including evacuations that significantly reduced exposure.Two days before the 10th anniversary of the disaster, the U.N. Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), which comprises 52 scientists from 27 countries, published an update to a 2014 report, based on data up to the end of 2019.“The updated (radiation) dose estimates to members of the public have either decreased or are comparable with the Scientific Committee’s previous estimates,” UNSCEAR said in a statement.“The Committee therefore continues to consider that future health effects directly related to radiation exposure are unlikely to be discernible.”There has, however, been an increase in thyroid cancers in children.The thyroid - a gland in the neck that produces hormones - is the most exposed organ as radioactive iodine concentrates there. Children are especially vulnerable.In a first round between 2011 and 2015, more than 300,000 people aged 18 and under in the Fukushima area were screened for thyroid cancer using highly sensitive ultrasound equipment, UNSCEAR said, revealing 116 cases of actual or suspected cancer.A study using equivalent equipment in three prefectures not exposed to radiation from Fukushima found rates of thyroid cysts and nodules - possible indications of cancer - as high as those in the Fukushima screening, UNSCEAR added.“On the balance of available evidence, the large increase ... in the number of thyroid cancers detected among exposed children is not the result of radiation exposure,” UNSCEAR said.“Rather, they are the result of ultrasensitive screening procedures that have revealed the prevalence of thyroid abnormalities in the population not previously detected.”",Reuters

Myanmar has a large community in Thailand.Rallies have taken place outside the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok and the regional headquarters of the United Nations, urging the body to take action.The memo did not specifically mention demonstrations about Myanmar, but said the request covers protests in “Bangkok, United Nations, embassies”.Thailand has also seen a resumption recently of youth-led protests against its government.Thailand has called for restraint and dialogue in Myanmar, but has stopped short of criticising the military for seizing power.Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said no order had been issued by the immigration bureau, as did foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat, who said the issue could be a “miscommunication”.Police Colonel Charoenpong Khantilo, chief of the immigration office in Pathum Thani, where the university is located, said no threat had been made to revoke visas and blacklist foreign students.“We are concerned about their safety and worried that they will get involved in wrongdoing from participating in protests,” Charoenpong told Reuters, adding that a emergency decree was in force that prohibits mass gatherings.“We never wanted to limit the students’ freedom of expression,” he said.",Reuters

He has not been charged with a crime. Officials declined to say whether any other agents were present.Federal agents have charged more than 300 people so far with taking part in the riot, including several with connections to law enforcement. They include police officers from Texas and Virginia, a former New York City police officer and a retired FBI section chief who prosecutors allege plotted with a militia group to overrun the Capitol.Gaspari said Ibrahim was outside the Capitol because “it was a historic event.” She said he did not pass a set of metal barricades outside the building that were quickly overrun by the crowd.While members of the group smashed windows and rampaged through the Capitol, hunting for then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress, others fought with police outside, hitting them with flagpoles and dousing them in bear spray.“We’re walking a line between the First Amendment and insurrectionist behavior,” Gaspari said.Ibrahim worked in a DEA office in the Los Angeles suburbs. Gaspari said he had turned in his resignation before Jan. 6, but withdrew it before it took effect.DEA officials learned Ibrahim had been outside the Capitol after he sent photographs from his phone to a group chat of fellow agents. The agency took his weapons and credentials while it decides how to proceed.John Lavinsky, a spokesman for the Justice Department’s Inspector General, said he could not “confirm or deny the existence of investigations” but that the office was examining the Jan. 6 siege and had asked authorities to notify it about any allegations of misconduct by federal agents.",Reuters

116,Some Republican governors stand by mask mandates as Texas and Mississippi accelerate reopening,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/some-republican-governors-stand-by-mask-mandates-as-texas-and-mississippi-accelerate-reopening-idUSKCN2AV2ML,"(Reuters) - While Texas and Mississippi announced complete rollbacks of their states’ COVID-19 mitigation measures this week, several governors of other Republican states have made clear they are not abandoning their mask mandates despite political pressure.The sharp decline of new daily COVID-19 cases and the rollout of vaccines in the United States have prompted state and local governments to ease business restrictions in recent weeks, with movie theaters set to open at limited capacity in New York and indoor dining resuming in San Francisco on Friday. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR)However, the decline in cases plateaued last week with new infections rising in 29 out of 50 states compared with the prior week. Texas saw a 69% rise in cases in the week ended Feb. 28.Few of the rollbacks have been as sweeping as in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday said the state’s mask mandate would be lifted and most businesses could open at full capacity next week.The move drew immediate criticism from some politicians and public health experts who have urged caution while the nation’s vaccination program is still underway.President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that decisions to end the required wearing of masks - such as those made by Texas and Mississippi - amounted to “Neanderthal thinking” given the ongoing deaths being caused by the pandemic.“I think it’s a big mistake. Look, I hope everybody’s realized by now, these masks make a difference,” he told reporters.Public health experts agree face coverings are essential to slowing the spread of the virus, which has killed more than half a million Americans. But over the last year, resistance to public health measures in the United States, especially mask-wearing, has become politicized, with many Republican states enacting fewer and looser COVID-19 protocols than Democratic states.In some Republican-led states, including Florida and South Dakota, there has never been a statewide mask mandate. In others, like Alabama and Ohio, mask mandates remain in effect.Including the upcoming change in Texas, 34 states mandate that residents wear face masks in public, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.In Ohio, U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel on Wednesday called on Republican Governor Mike DeWine to follow Texas’ lead and repeal the statewide mask order. The governor quickly rejected the idea.“Ohio will be keeping its mask mandate to protect Ohioans who have yet to receive the vaccine. Vaccine supply is increasing, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the virus is still here and the pandemic is still ongoing today,” a spokesman for DeWine told Reuters in an email.Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Republican, said on Wednesday he was not ready to ease any restrictions, including an indoor mask mandate.“All businesses must continue to follow the safety guidelines,” Justice said.Abbott’s executive order in Texas will lift all mask requirements statewide as of March 10 and forbid local authorities from penalizing residents who do not wear face coverings. It will remove all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of hospitalizations.Local officials can still apply limits to businesses where hospitalizations remain high, according to the order, but are prohibited from mandating that they operate at less than 50% capacity.As of Monday, Texas was seeing about 7,500 new cases per day on a seven-day average, according to Reuters data, and it was ranked 47th in the list of states that have vaccinated the highest percentage of their populations.Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, on Tuesday also lifted his state’s mask order and removed all restrictions on businesses.But Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat in a majority Republican state, doubled down on his state’s mask order even as it increased capacity to 75% at restaurants and retail businesses on Wednesday.“Louisiana’s mask mandate is still in place,” Edwards tweeted. “As we vaccinate more and more people, masks are still our most effective tool in stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.”",Reuters

Because of prejudice, however, some people like her opted to keep a low profile.A survey by the Streha organisation which offers shelter to LGBT community members found that 80% of 200 LGBT respondents had considered leaving Albania.A 2021 report by ILGA gay rights organisation, which bring together over 600 groups from 54 countries in Europe and Central Asia, said that discrimination against the LGBT population in Albania had increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.Another study, by Abania’s Alenacea non-governmental organisation, found one in two LGBT community members had experienced psychological violence and bullying, one in five had been sexually harassed and some had been raped, the ILGA report said. Only 7% reported the incidents to the authorities.“Another problem lies in access to health care,” Xheni Karaj, an LGBT activist, told Reuters.“When I took transgender people to the hospital, the doctors said why not let these people die.”",Reuters

But recently things have calmed down. My life is looking more like how it was before the disaster.”“I’m still a little worried about what will happen to the fishing industry in the next 10 years. There’s some talk about releasing the treated radioactive water from Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean. I’m very worried about what will happen after that. There are still uncertainties in the future.”“It’s about smiling. Back then, a lot of people were depressed and had gloomy faces, but I think it’s important to show that we’re getting our smiles back, and that’s not just because of the Olympics. It’s important to show people that we’re getting our smiles back like before.”“We have not recovered at all. There is still vacant land. So there’s nothing for tourists to see in Fukushima Prefecture, and only a few people have returned.”TAKESHI FURUKAWA, 58, EMPLOYEE AT AQUAMARINE FUKUSHIMA AQUARIUM:“Before the earthquake and tsunami, about 900,000 people used to come to the aquarium annually, but after the disaster, the number of visitors have been hovering around 500,000. Because of this, the aquarium’s revenue has declined and it’s been difficult to start new business projects. I think the aquarium as a whole has not been spirited over the past 10 years.”“The radiation was bad just until recently. It’s not so bad now, and I sometimes go back to my hometown in Namie closer to the Fukushima nuclear power plant during the weekends. Things are gradually recovering and the environment has gotten better for people to return to areas closer to the nuclear plant. It is pretty difficult now to travel because of the coronavirus, but when the coronavirus is contained, I hope people will come visit.”“If the earthquake and tsunami hadn’t happened, I would have been able to spend more time with my old friends. In the past 10 years. I evacuated from Naraha and made new friends, so that was good. But I don’t want natural disasters.”",Reuters

We are going to do it.’”Latin America, where countries are seeing a mix of reopening and new waves of COVID-19, has been hard hit by the pandemic, with 22 million people pushed into poverty and weak social safety nets, an annual U.N. report said on Thursday.It said the number in extreme poverty was at a level not seen for 20 years, and it pointed to deep structural inequalities, a sprawling informal labor market and a lack of effective health care coverage - meaning many people end up paying for treatment out of pocket.In Paraguay, that has sparked a wave of informal fundraising, with bake sales and short-term loans as family members seek to meet the costs of medical care.Mirta González, a 34-year-old manicurist from a small town in southern Paraguay, took an express loan when her husband Jesús got sick and was transferred to the capital Asuncion. She spent 6.5 million guarani ($985) on medications and supplies.Family and friends organized raffles and sold pizzas to raise more funds.“Here without contacts or money you will die,” González told Reuters while waiting to be called by a loudspeaker to deliver medicine to her husband at INERAM, the main COVID-19 treatment center in the country.In the landlocked country of some seven million people only around one in five have social security and heath cover via their jobs, and only around 7% pay for private cover, government data show. Free state care is open for all but is very limited.‘ABSOLUTELY NO BEDS’In the Brazilian city of Manaus, where a surge in COVID-19 case in January led to a collapse in public health services, Cintia Melo was forced to look after her 87-year-old mother at home, hiring carers and a ventilator, and renting or buying oxygen cylinders.“There were absolutely no hospital beds at all,” the freelance video producer said by telephone. She said it was costing about 20,000 reais ($3,553) a month and, even though her mother was now recovering, she would still need care for several more weeks, maybe months.“The costs haven’t finished yet,” Melo said.Verónica Serafini, an economic researcher in Paraguay, said health expenses were the main driver pushing people into debt and this would snarl a revival of growth after the pandemic eased, key as the commodities-rich region looks to bounce back.“Instead of investing in a house, business or education, we are getting into debt for health. And there’s no possibility of growth if people lose assets when they get sick,” she said.‘A BLOW NO-ONE WAS PREPARED FOR’The wave of indebtedness comes as millions of Latin American families grieve loved ones who died during the pandemic. The region has recorded more than 687,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths, a Reuters tally shows, second only to the death toll in Europe.Renata Granados, 24, and her family in Querétaro, Mexico, were forced to sell the family pick-up truck in a raffle after her sister Paloma got infected and died after 21 days in hospital. The bill was 7 million Mexican pesos (about $330,000).“The expenses were very large when she was in the hospital and we had to find a way to raise funds,” said Granados, who herself is training to be a doctor. She said her sister had been an inspiration.“I feel like it was a blow that no one was prepared for.”The report last week by the U.N.’s Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said that in addition to rising poverty the pandemic had caused growing social tensions.But it said things would be worse without measures taken by Latin American governments to transfer emergency income to some 84 million households, or about half the population.The commission’s executive secretary, Alicia Bárcena, said people were living through heightened uncertainty due to the pandemic and that “it is necessary to build back with equality and sustainability, aiming to create a true welfare state, a task long postponed in the region.”Back in Peru, 26-year-old Yoselin Marticorena waited outside the Villa el Salvador hospital for news about her father. Her mother and sister also had COVID-19 symptoms and she said there was no one left to help support her.“I don’t know what to do, I truly sold everything already,” she said amid pitched tents outside the hospital. “I already got into debt. I have no one else to ask for help.”",Reuters

Women across Mexico took to the streets on Monday to protest the crisis of violence they face on a daily basis, fueled by what they say is an out of touch government, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's support for a politician accused of rape.

Yesterday it was my daughter. Tomorrow it could be another girl,” said 39-year-old Irma Quesada.She said her 12-year-old daughter was still recovering in hospital after being raped and stabbed in the face last week by a 45-year-old man, who is now in jail but who authorities have warned may not stay behind bars because of a lack of evidence.According to public policy think tank Mexico Evalua, which analyzed government data, five million women were victims of sexual violence in the second half of 2020 in Mexico, including harassment, sexual abuse, attempted rape or rape, the vast majority of which did not get reported.The marches to mark International Women’s Day were smaller in size than last year’s demonstrations, likely because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.Activists in recent days have displayed a purple banner declaring “no abuser in power” across Mexico City’s main plaza, renamed streets with women’s names pasted over signs and used purple, green and pink on social media avatars.At the national palace, where Lopez Obrador resides, protesters painted the names of hundreds of femicide victims across 10-foot-tall (3-meter) metal barriers erected last week to protect the historic building from protesters.Demonstrators ripped down a section of the barrier and spray-painted sidewalks, kiosks and business facades from the Revolution monument to the historic center with graffiti accusing the government of not doing enough to prosecute femicides and commemorating murdered women.Their messages read “Macho AMLO”, in reference to Lopez Obrador, and “We’re not all here.”Mexican government data shows at least 939 cases of femicide, murders that specifically targeted victims because they were women, occurred last year. The crime rose nearly 130% between 2015 and 2020.Activists also projected feminist slogans in bright lights across the barricaded palace facade, including a message saying “a rapist will not be governor,” referring to Felix Salgado, a gubernatorial candidate for Guerrero state.Lopez Obrador has for weeks stood by Salgado, his party’s candidate in midterm elections in June, describing the calls for him to step down over rape allegations as politically motivated.Guerrero prosecutors are investigating one accusation of rape against Salgado, after earlier this year dropping a probe into another accusation that they say was filed too long after the alleged crime.Salgado has not responded to requests for comment, but Mexican media has reported that he has denied the allegations.Thousands of women flocked to the streets a year ago to demand a tougher government response against femicides, with some demonstrators chucking Molotov cocktails at the national palace and vandalizing buildings in what were otherwise peaceful protests.",Reuters

Shortly after the military seized power, 55 foreign investors in Myanmar from Coca Cola to Facebook signed a statement committing to the country and employees there during developments of ""deep concern"".

It said on Feb. 27 it was reducing its presence in the country amid concerns about violence and would pull its offshore exploration team - just one week after saying drilling would not be affected.This week, fashion giant H&M, which has around 45 direct suppliers in Myanmar and is also a signatory to the statement, said it had paused new orders from the country due to transport and manufacturing disruptions.H&M is not, however, taking any immediate decision on its long-term future in Myanmar.“We fully recognise the complexities ... in balancing different aspects to ensure that the people in Myanmar are not negatively affected,” said Serkan Tanka, Myanmar country manager at H&M.One large global firm has already made a dramatic exit. Kirin Holdings Co is winding up a beer alliance with a military-linked company after coming under pressure from activist groups.Escalating violence, which has seen more than 50 protesters killed, is only adding to the uncertainty facing companies anxious about reputational risk.“If this goes on for months, more would probably just totally leave,” said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Operating in Myanmar has long been a wrestle between high risk and potential high reward for foreign business.The opening up of one of Asia’s last frontier markets in 2011 after half a century of military rule led to a surge in foreign direct investment. Net inflows peaked at $4.7 billion in 2017 compared with $900 million in 2010, according to the World Bank.But even before the coup, firms were grappling with crumbling infrastructure, constant power disruptions, legal uncertainty and an economy controlled in large parts by the military.While all foreign firms will be assessing and will be assessed over their next moves, energy companies - some of the longest standing foreign investors in Myanmar - are particularly likely to come under further pressure.The United Nation’s human rights investigator on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a report last week that countries should impose sanctions on Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is now controlled by the military and represents its largest source of revenue.Total, which has been in Myanmar since 1992, and Chevron have a large offshore gas project in partnership with MOGE. A Chevron spokesperson said it will comply with all applicable laws and sanctions. Total declined comment on the threat of sanctions.Telecom and internet companies too are in a difficult position as they deal with intermittent shutdowns of services and new amendments to cyber laws that threaten human rights.Norway’s Telenor, which has a mobile licence in Myanmar, said on Monday that the amendments broaden the powers of the military and reduce civil liberties, calling for the restoration of a sound legal framework in Myanmar.Facebook on Feb. 2 banned the Myanmar military from using its Facebook and Instagram platforms.Just how corporates should respond to Myanmar’s challenges is a matter of hot debate.Chris Sidoti, an expert on Myanmar who was part of a U.N.-led fact-finding mission in 2019, says all foreign firms should suspend their businesses in Myanmar because the military has taken over every facet of government.Rights group Burma Campaign UK has called on Western brands to be diligent with who they work with but not to abandon Myanmar workers. Nearly half a million people in Myanmar are employed in factories producing textiles for retailers like H&M, Adidas, Gap and Zara.John Bray, director at business consultancy Control Risks, said that pressure on firms in Myanmar needed to be guided by an assessment of “complicity”.“If you are providing a service for the Myanmar people, which they are paid for and which promotes the development of the economy, I don’t think you’re complicit in what is going on in the streets,” said Bray.",Reuters

Collins’ support allows extra breathing room should another Democrat oppose the nomination.Manchin and Collins earlier rejected Biden’s proposed budget director, Neera Tanden, whose nomination was yanked on Tuesday.The two senators acknowledged the differ with Haaland on some issues, but praised her vow to work with both political parties.Collins, in her statement on Wednesday, also cited “Haaland’s willingness to support issues important to the State of Maine, such as Acadia National Park, as well as her deep knowledge of tribal issues.”The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is expected to vote on Haaland’s nomination on Thursday. If approved, it would move to the full Senate for a vote.Tensions were raised at her confirmation hearing last week as Republicans targeted her past opposition to fossil fuel projects and Biden’s agenda to combat climate change.The Interior Department oversees the nation’s vast public lands and waters, including 500 million acres of federal and tribal lands as well as offshore federal waters.",Reuters

But that was not an option after moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would not vote to approve the think tank director.Manchin’s defection had sent the White House - and Tanden - scrambling to find one Republican backer. But they ultimately came up empty-handed, even after a last-minute meeting with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski on Monday.Her backers decried what they called a hypocritical and sexist push to punish Tanden for harsh tweets directed at both Democrats and Republicans, after four years of similar language used by Republican former President Donald Trump.Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, tweeted: “Disheartening. For salty tweets. After what we’ve been through for 4 years.”Biden said he still planned to have Tanden - a confidante of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton - serve in his administration, but did not say which job she might get.Tanden, 50, an Indian American, would have been the first woman of color to lead the OMB, which manages the $4 trillion federal budget.Shalanda Young, Biden’s pick for the No. 2 OMB job, has won the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus to replace Tanden. A former staffer in the House of Representatives, Young would be the second Black woman in Biden’s Cabinet if she were to become OMB director.In an interview with CNN prior to the announcement that Tanden was withdrawing her nomination, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said Young did “really, really well” during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday for the deputy’s post.Asked if he would support her for the top job, Sanders said: “Ms. Young made a very strong presentation today. ... But it is the function of the president of the United States to make that nomination, not me.”Other possible candidates include former National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and Ann O’Leary, another former aide to Hillary Clinton. Biden’s transition team had discussed both for possible roles in the administration.In a letter released by the White House, Tanden told Biden her nomination had become more than an uphill climb.“Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities,” Tanden said.Tanden, who served in the administrations of Democratic former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, repeatedly apologized for her harsh tweets during her confirmation hearings, but ultimately was unable to convince senators she had the right personality to lead the OMB.She had taken aim at lawmakers across the political spectrum, including Sanders, and in 2016 criticized Manchin’s daughter, then the chief executive of pharmaceutical firm Mylan, after the company raised prices for its anti-allergy EpiPen.To shore up support, Tanden met with 46 different senators, advocacy groups, the business community, labor unions and faith leaders, even winning endorsements from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Communications Workers of America and others.",Reuters

(Reuters) - Leaders of South Dakota’s legislature said on Tuesday they would push to suspend impeachment action against Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over his conduct in a fatal car crash until criminal charges lodged against him are resolved.Calls for Ravnsborg’s ouster mounted last month after state authorities took the extraordinary step of releasing video of police interrogations of the attorney general and other evidence from the Sept. 12 incident, in which his car struck and killed a man walking along a highway.As shown in the video, Ravnsborg told police he believed he had run into a deer, rather than a person, until he returned to the scene the following day to find the body of the victim, 55-year-old Joe Boever, lying in a roadside ditch.Investigators suggested that Ravnsborg’s account lacked credibility, telling him under questioning that a broken pair of eyeglasses belonging to Boever were found in his car, meaning the victim’s face had gone through the windshield on impact.Police also told Ravnsborg that Boever had been carrying a flashlight, which was still illuminated when they found it the next day, and that evidence showed Ravnsborg’s car had driven onto the shoulder of the road where the victim was walking.The video sparked immediate outrage. Governor Kristi Noem demanded the resignation of Ravnsborg, a fellow Republican facing three misdemeanor charges in the accident. A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced an impeachment resolution in the state’s Republican-controlled House of Representatives.But dynamics changed after a state judge last week ruled that public posting of investigative evidence violated Ravnsborg’s rights to a fair trial and ordered such material in the criminal probe sealed.In a joint statement on Tuesday, House Speaker Spencer Gosch and other legislative leaders called for halting impeachment proceedings at least until “the courts have concluded their business” in the case.“Our proceedings need to be fair and transparent,” Gosch said, adding that in light of last week’s court order, “we have some concerns on what our abilities are in a public proceeding.”The suspension was expected to be adopted by a House committee as an amendment to the impeachment resolution on Wednesday.The announcement came nearly six months after the deadly nighttime crash, which occurred near Highmore, as the attorney general was driving home to Pierre, the state capital, from a fundraiser. Highmore is about 50 miles east of Pierre.Ravnsborg insisted he never saw anyone by the side of the road, never saw a light in the pitch dark, and was so startled by the collision that he was focused on pulling his car safely to the side of the road.Ravnsborg also denied veering onto the shoulder of the road before the collision. He said he was setting the vehicle on cruise-control when the crash occurred and was not distracted with his cellphone or other devices.Toxicology tests released by state authorities showed no evidence of impairment.",Reuters

Markle, a former lighting director for U.S. TV soaps and sitcoms, pulled out of the wedding days beforehand after undergoing heart surgery.He said his daughter had let him down while he was ill.“I also feel that she let me down,” Markle said. “I was in a hospital bed the last time we talked and we I never heard from them again - they didn’t care if I died.”Asked about the interview Meghan and Harry gave to Oprah Winfrey, Markle said “they went way over the top,” and should have waited, considering that Queen Elizabeth’s husband Prince Philip was in hospital.“They should have waited considering the queen’s age and Philip’s age,” he said.",Reuters

He is undergoing a 14-day mandatory quarantine after arriving in Australia on Monday.“It is only because it is against Beijing’s will that people are thrown into jail.”Hui said he had decided to move to Australia from Britain, where he has spent the past three months, to spread the international reach of the pro-democracy activists.“I feel more responsible now as an exile to tell the world how ridiculous it is,” he said.Hui said during the interview that the coronavirus pandemic was stable in Australia, and he would be able to undertake face-to-face lobbying work.In a Facebook post on Tuesday announcing his move, Hui said that Australia and New Zealand are important members of the Five Eye intelligence sharing group that also includes the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, which have endorsed the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.“I hope that my lobbying work will make the two countries tougher against China, have stronger support and actions towards the freedom of Hong Kong,” he said in the post.As part of his lobbying, Hui told Reuters he would also seek more flexible visas for Hong Kong people seeking to come to Australia.Hui said he was grateful to the Australian government for granting a visa and a place on a repatriation flight from London. He said he did not intend to apply for political asylum.Australia’s home affairs office said it did not comment on individual cases.Jane Poon, a representative of pro-democracy community group Australia Hong Kong Link, said Hui’s arrival would encourage Australia’s large Hong Kong community.“He would be able to contribute a lot in lobbying work, especially as Australia has been a main battlefield against the (Chinese Communist Party),” Poon told Reuters.Hong Kong police ordered HSBC to freeze Hui’s bank accounts in December after he said he would go into exile in Britain to continue his pro-democracy activities.",Reuters

Teenagers are being mass-tested for COVID -- a logistical headache for schools -- and are required to wear face coverings in class.Despite these restrictions, the near-consensus among parents, teachers, child psychologists, social workers and broader society is that getting children back into schools is urgent for their mental health, education and life chances.Most pupils had missed out on more than three months of school in the spring and early summer of 2020, when Britain was under its first strict national COVID lockdown.In that first shutdown, as in the recent one, only children considered vulnerable or those whose parents are classified as “key workers” by the government were allowed to go to school. However, even they were not having normal lessons, as teachers were busy organising distance learning for all the others.",Reuters

The Xinjiang government did not immediately respond to a request for more details on the case on Tuesday.Experts said if it the suit would be the first known instance of a foreign researcher facing civil action in China over human rights research that has contributed to pressure for economic sanctions, and comes as Beijing has been stepping up its defence against foreign accusations of human rights abuses, which it denies.The administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump in December banned imports of cotton from Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), which produces around 30% of China’s cotton. In January it announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations that they were made with forced labour, without citing the source of the allegations.XPCC could not be reached for comment by Reuters on Tuesday.“It (the suit) would seem to be a tactic to try to raise the costs for those doing research on these kinds of severe human rights abuses,” said Sarah Cook, New York-based Research Director for China at U.S. non-profit Freedom House.“It could set a worrisome precedent ... it could send a signal to foreign companies or others who might be considering being more outspoken or changing business practices due to what is happening in Xinjiang,” she said.Zenz is a senior fellow in China studies at the U.S.-based Victims of Communism Foundation, a non-profit that researches human rights in communist countries, and a critic of China’s ethnic policy in Xinjiang and Tibet whose research has been widely cited in western media, including Reuters.Zenz said the lawsuit shows that his research is having an impact, although he believes the case is symbolic. He said he had last been in China more than a decade ago and has no intention of returning to China in the immediate future.“That’s probably the most direct statement that some of these companies are incurring economic losses as the result of my publication,” he told Reuters on Tuesday. He said he had no knowledge of the contents of the suit.Zen in December published a report that estimated around half a million people from ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are employed in cotton picking through coercive labour transfer programmes. The research was based on an analysis of Chinese government documents and state media.Last July, state media reported that Beijing was considering suing Zenz for libelling China, though no public information has since been released on any potential case and Zenz has not heard of any suit.On Monday, China’s parliament said it will speed up lawmaking aimed at countering foreign sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction” amid increasing pressure from Western countries over issues ranging from Xinjiang to civil rights in Hong Kong.",Reuters

Three Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a wide-ranging climate bill on Tuesday that embraces President Joe Biden's goals to curb climate change including decarbonizing the electric grid by 2035.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climate-house/democrats-in-u-s-house-introduce-wide-ranging-climate-bill-idUSKCN2AU2JQ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a wide-ranging climate bill on Tuesday that embraces President Joe Biden’s goals to curb climate change including decarbonizing the electric grid by 2035.Introduced by Representatives Frank Pallone, Paul Tonko and Bobby Rush, and incorporating input from the Biden administration, the bill includes a federal clean electricity standard requiring a percentage of retail power sales to come from sources that produce little or no carbon emissions.The Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s Future Act, or CLEAN, requires 80% clean electricity by 2030 and 100% by 2035.The power could come from sources including wind, solar and existing nuclear energy. That could provide a boost to nuclear power, an industry experiencing shutdowns amid low prices for natural gas, a competing fuel.The bill also sets a goal of a fully decarbonized economy by 2050.On transportation, the largest source of carbon emissions, the bill authorizes $100 million annually from fiscal 2022 to 2031 for entities that install publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) supply equipment. It also requires the energy secretary to establish a program to help determine where EV charging stations are needed and expands EV access in disadvantaged communities.The legislation, which needs to pass committees and then the full House and Senate and be signed by Biden before becoming law, does not include a carbon tax, a mechanism supported by some Republicans and companies.“The votes are just not there for a price on carbon,” also known as a carbon tax, Pallone told reporters. He said a carbon price had concerns from an environmental justice perspective because it could allow industries to keep polluting as long as they buy permits from entities that have cut emissions elsewhere.“It’s time to try something new,” Pallone said, noting that carbon tax plans failed in Congress most recently in 2009/2010. Tonko, who prefers a carbon tax, called a clean energy standard “achievable.”Three Republican representatives, including David McKinley from coal-producing West Virginia, said the bill’s mandates would raise energy prices and make the country more reliant on Chinese critical mineral supplies.They want policies to “capture all the advantages of our abundant resources, which include coal, hydropower, nuclear technologies, and clean natural gas.”Another climate bill from McKinley, and Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, includes a less ambitious goal of requiring utilities to cut emissions 80% by 2050. Pallone said his bill could be adjusted to draw Republican support.Given the thinnest possible Democratic majority in the Senate, Pallone suggested that senators could try to pass the bill under budget reconciliation in that chamber. That process requires only 51 votes instead of 60 in the 100-member Senate.",Reuters

Raising the hourly wage to $15 was a campaign promise of Democratic President Joe Biden.“The minimum wage as it now stands is immoral,” Hoyer, a Democrat, told reporters.In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters a minimum wage increase along the lines that Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney have proposed was “worth discussing,” but not a hike to $15. Cotton and Romney say the hourly wage could be gradually raised to $10.Democrats had hoped to get a minimum wage increase to $15 included in a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, which is currently being advanced under a process that allows it to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes normally required in the Senate. But the Senate’s rules expert said no.So the House will bring the $15 wage proposal to the floor “in the near future,” Hoyer said, without giving specifics.Hoyer said Democrats will have to work with Republicans to get the wage hike passed, because right now there are not 60 votes in the Senate for boosting the minimum wage. Democrats and their allies have 50 votes in the Senate.“We’re going to send that over to the Senate, and hope ... there are 10 (Republican) senators who believe that having people work for $7.25 an hour and in poverty after 40 hours of workweek is not right in America,” he said.",Reuters

It also helps negotiate trade agreements and enforces laws on trade and national security.At her confirmation hearing, Raimondo vowed to protect U.S. telecommunications networks from Chinese companies. But she refused to commit to keeping telecommunications company Huawei Technologies on a U.S. economic blacklist.The Commerce Department under former President Donald Trump took aim at China on numerous fronts, adding dozens of Chinese companies to a trade blacklist, including Huawei, the country’s top chipmaker SMIC, Hikvision and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology.In written responses to lawmakers, Raimondo said she had “no reason to believe” that the listed Chinese companies should not be.“We should have no illusions about China’s objectives, which I believe are to undercut America’s longstanding technological advantage and to displace America as the global leader in cutting-edge research and development and the industries of the future,” she said.Raimondo inherits the Trump administration’s unsuccessful effort to bar U.S. app stores run by Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned TikTok or WeChat for download. The Justice Department last month put appeals of rulings blocking those efforts on hold pending a Biden administration review of the efforts.",Reuters

Representatives of 30 nations meet on Tuesday to seek ways to save fast-depleting tuna stocks in the Indian Ocean as demand in Asia and the West soars for sushi and tinned fish.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-tuna/talks-start-to-protect-indian-oceans-depleting-tuna-idUSKBN2B10DF,"(Reuters) - Representatives of 30 nations meet on Tuesday to seek ways to save fast-depleting tuna stocks in the Indian Ocean as demand in Asia and the West soars for sushi and tinned fish.The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which groups coastal countries from Australia to Kenya plus major fishing region the European Union, was convening virtually over five days to debate yellowfin tuna quotas.Environmentalists say the warm water species is at risk of depletion as over-fishing compounds other threats from climate change and pollution.There is corporate concern too: British supermarkets Tesco and Co-op and Belgian retailer Colruyt pledged last year to stop buying Indian Ocean yellowfin unless the U.N.-mandated commission adopts a plan to rebuild stocks.The International Union for Conservation of Nature has for nearly a decade had the species on its “Red List”.Yet the total global catch has risen by about a third, to nearly 450,000 metric tons annually, according to the London-based Blue Marine Foundation advocacy group.It estimates yellowfin tuna stocks could “collapse” - meaning they would go beyond the minimum size needed for recovery - within the next five years if the catch is not cut.French and Spanish fishing fleets take the majority of fish, using industrial methods such as “purse seine” with huge nets that often net juvenile yellowfin yet to begin reproducing.‘DELAY COULD BE CATASTROPHIC’Coastal nations want to limit Europe’s distant-water fleets.Kenya and Sri Lanka, for example, want more curbs on devices such as fish aggregators: floating objects that attract tuna and other species towards nets.“They are the visitors,” said Will McCallum, Head of Oceans at environmental group Greenpeace UK, of the European fleets. “They are fishing at a far larger capacity than anybody else, and it’s not an equitable state of affairs.”The Maldives wants the yellowfin catch to be cut by 15% from 2015 levels, when IOTC scientists first agreed they were being overfished.The IOTC had last year recommended cutting the catch by 20% from 2014 levels, but rowed back in January, saying that was distorted by projections from the 2018 stock assessment.Given that a new stock assessment will not be ready until the end of 2021, the commission may postpone new measures, according to the Blue Marine Foundation.“For a stock that is at risk of collapse, this delay could prove catastrophic,” it said in a statement.The European Union proposes a total catch reduction from nearly 438,000 metric tons in 2019 to around 380,000.Demand for yellowfin is booming as its light meat is widely used for tinned fish and in sushi in North America, Europe and Asia. The global yellowfin market in 2018 was worth $15.8 billion, the second-highest value of the seven tuna species, according to a report by the world’s largest canned tuna company, Thai Union Group PCL.Greenpeace’s McCallum said the over-fishing issue had stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic and drastic action was needed now to avoid irrecoverable damage to the species.",Reuters

The committee will also be given powers to select many legislators.It was “solely China’s internal affair on how to design and improve the system,” Song said, adding “destabilising forces” had taken advantage of “loopholes” in the past.Critics have decried Beijing’s moves as the end of democratic dreams in the former British colony, whose mini-constitution states universal suffrage as its goal.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Only half of its legislature is currently picked through democratic vote, a proportion which will shrink under the new system. Other seats in the legislature and the electoral committee taken by lower-level, democratically elected district council officials, are expected to be scrapped.The changes to the electoral system follow a series of moves by Beijing to reassert its control over China’s most restive city and set it on an increasingly authoritarian path.China imposed a sweeping national security law in June 2020 and authorities have since arrested most high-profile opposition politicians and activists for offences under the new law or related to the 2019 protests.Song said China wanted to create a new “democratic” electoral system, which will “fully respect” the public’s democratic rights.

The unrest is the worst the country has seen in years as youth also vent frustrations about unemployment, inequality and corruption.In his first public comments since the start of the turmoil, Sall said he understood why young people had taken to the streets.“Because you don’t have a job, because you aspire to a better future,” he said in a televised speech, pledging to provide extra funding to support employment and entrepreneurship.He promised to shorten a nightly pandemic-linked curfew that has proved particularly unpopular, stifling the informal economy on which millions depend.“I will use all the powers conferred on me by my office to support a return to calm,” he said.Political pressure has risen against Sall, whose tenure has been plagued by accusations that he unjustly torpedoes political challengers and worries that he may seek to extend his rule beyond his allotted two-term limit.Sonko, who finished third in the 2019 presidential election, was arrested last Wednesday after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. He denies the accusation and says it is an attempt by Sall to kneecap a rival.The government denies this.Many are suspicious of the accusations against Sonko because two other prominent rivals of Sall were previously targeted by criminal charges that prevented them from running for president in 2019.",Reuters

Sonko denies the allegation.Many protesters see Sonko’s arrest as an attempt by Sall to torpedo the career of a prominent rival, not as a legitimate reaction to a credible rape charge.Sall has been accused of targeting other political rivals in recent years, prompting accusations of political interference.The charismatic former mayor of Dakar, Khalifa Sall (no relation to the president), was sentenced to five years in jail in 2018 for embezzlement, ruling him out of the 2019 presidential race. The president pardoned Sall after the election, raising suspicions that the charges were deliberately timed for the vote.Karim Wade, the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade and a presidential hopeful himself, was jailed in 2015 for corruption, ending his political ambitions. He was also subsequently pardoned and now lives in Qatar.Sonko’s arrest has served as a lightning rod for other frustrations. Many Senegalese resent what they see as the corruption, injustice and economic imbalance caused by rapid modernisation.The West African economy is expected to be transformed this decade by new oil and gas production. Major construction projects, including a new city outside the capital Dakar, are attracting global investment and enriching a small elite. Most Senegalese see little benefit.Allegations of corruption surrounding the award of a petroleum license to a company run by the president’s brother triggered street protests in 2016. Many Senegalese see international corporations as the only winners.The arrival of COVID-19 in 2020 widened the gap between rich and poor. Restrictions on gatherings and a nightly curfew have done little to stem infections, critics say, but they have strangled the informal economy that provides cash-in-hand wages to millions of people. The curfew provoked clashes between the youth and police last year.A second wave of infections this year has prolonged restrictions and threatens to derail an economic rebound.Macky Sall was swept to power in 2012 on a wave of popular support. His predecessor Abdoulaye Wade’s third-term bid triggered mass protests and Sall’s election win was seen as a victory for regional democracy.Now, many protesters worry that Sall will use a change in the constitution in 2016 to extend his rule into a third term.Leaders in Guinea and Ivory Coast have used constitutional changes to act as a reset button on their rule, allowing them to run again.Sall, 59, has not ruled out this option, stoking fears - and anger - that he might jeopardise Senegal’s once bright democratic future.",Reuters

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has retained a prominent white-collar criminal defense lawyer to represent his office in a federal investigation into the state's misreporting of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents, a spokesman said on Monday.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-cuomo/new-york-governor-cuomo-hires-defense-lawyer-in-nursing-home-probe-idUSKCN2AT3NJ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has retained a prominent white-collar criminal defense lawyer to represent his office in a federal investigation into the state’s misreporting of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents, a spokesman said on Monday.Cuomo has come under fire in recent weeks over his office’s role in reporting the official count of coronavirus fatalities among patients of nursing and extended-care facilities, as well as for allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him.Elkan Abramowitz, a former federal prosecutor now working in private practice in New York City, was hired to represent Cuomo’s “executive chamber” - consisting of the governor and his immediate staff - in the U.S. Justice Department inquiry into the COVID-19 nursing home deaths, senior advisor Rich Azzopardi told Reuters in a text message.Azzopardi earlier told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Abramowitz’s appointment, that Cuomo had not hired a lawyer in connection with the sexual harassment probe.Cuomo, one of the nation’s best-known Democraticpoliticians, has been accused by two former aides of engaging in a series of unwanted, sexually suggestive comments, and in one case an unsolicited kiss.On Sunday, he apologized if any of his remarks or behavior were misinterpreted as flirtatious and said he never tried to make anyone feel uncomfortable. He said he never physically touched anyone.New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday said she had accepted the governor’s formal referral of the matter to her office, clearing the way for appointment of an outside counsel to conduct an investigation into the accounts of both women - Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett.Late on Monday, a third woman, Anna Ruch, came forward in an interview published by the New York Times to accuse the governor of inappropriate conduct at a September 2019 wedding reception.As reported by the Times, Ruch recounted the governor first put his hand on her bare lower back, then when she brushed his hand away, called her “aggressive” and placed his hands on her cheeks and asked her if he could kiss her.Ruch, according to the Times, said she pulled away and the encounter left her feeling “confused and shocked and embarrassed.” The moment was caught in a cellphone photo Ruch said was taken by a friend and published by the Times with the article.Reuters was unable to independently verify Ruch’s account. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful. A representative for Cuomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The New York governor’s brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, told viewers late on Monday he could not cover stories surrounding the allegations on the governor due their relation.“Obviously, I’m aware of what’s going on with my brother,” the CNN host said on Monday. “Obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother. Now, of course CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so.”The often outspoken governor has stayed mostly out of the public eye since the sexual harassment scandal started gaining traction last week. Cuomo rose to national prominence for his daily televised briefings last spring, when New York was the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.In January, the attorney general’s office issued a report that cast doubt on the Cuomo administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying the state health department significantly undercounted the death toll in nursing homes and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.Before entering private practice, Abramowitz worked as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where he served as chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney’s office.Abramowitz represented Cuomo’s office when federal prosecutors investigated the governor for disbanding an anti-corruption agency in 2014. He also represented filmmaker Woody Allen for many years, defending him against abuse allegations.",Reuters

Biden’s fellow Democrats have a majority in the House, but the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, where the measure would need support from all 50 members of that party caucus, plus 10 Republicans.Republicans have said the law would take powers away from states and raise fraud concerns.Democrats have been fighting to expand access to the polls through early voting, vote-by-mail and other measures, efforts that expanded as the coronavirus pandemic raged.Republicans have been fighting those efforts and pursuing measures to curb access to the polls. Former President Donald Trump, in his first public speech after his stinging Nov. 3 election loss to Biden, on Sunday proposed limiting absentee voting and days when Americans can vote.Biden beat Trump by more than 7 million votes in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats enjoy an advantage over Republicans in voter party affiliation.Trump never conceded the loss, and some of his supporters violently contested Congress’ certification of Biden’s win at the Capitol in a deadly Jan. 6 riot.Since then, dozens of local Republican lawmakers have introduced bills that would limit voting in states across the country.Georgia’s House of Representatives on Monday approved a bill that restricts ballot drop boxes and limits early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches. If passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate and signed into law by Republican Governor Brian Kemp, the measure could be devastating for Black voters, activists have said.A fight is also brewing over the forthcoming redrawing of a map that determines which areas of the country are represented by which House member. In many states that process is led by state legislatures, which are mostly controlled by Republicans.Legislatures have historically redrawn the borders in ways that helped their party win more elections, sometimes minimizing the influence of Black voters.The House bill would turn much of that authority over to commissions that Republicans have said would not be accountable to citizens in their states.",Reuters
155,Senate to debate COVID-19 bill this week after Democrats retreat on minimum wage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/senate-to-debate-covid-19-bill-this-week-after-democrats-retreat-on-minimum-wage-idUSKCN2AT228,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will start debating President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill this week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday after Democrats backed down from an effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 as part of it.The backpedaling did not end hopes of addressing the minimum wage issue in Congress. Democrats and some Republicans have voiced support for the idea of raising the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, for the first time since 2009, although they disagree on how much.Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton last week proposed an increase to $10 per hour, but said employers should verify the wage is going to workers who are legally in the United States.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives early on Saturday narrowly approved the COVID-19 package, one of Biden’s top priorities. The House bill included the minimum wage hike.Democrats aim to pass the legislation in the Senate trough a maneuver known as “reconciliation,” which would allow the bill to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes normally required by that chamber’s rules.Senate debate on the COVID-19 bill could begin as early as Wednesday, a Senate Democratic aide said.Senate Democrats over the weekend gave up on the idea of trying to pass the minimum wage hike by adding tax penalties to the COVID-19 bill, after earlier being told that Senate rules governing “reconciliation” prevented them including a straight-up wage hike to the legislation.There are also political hurdles. Some moderate Democrats, including Senator Joe Manchin, have rejected the $15 figure as too high and suggested an $11 target could be more realistic.“We worked through the weekend and it became clear that finalizing ‘plan B’ with the caucus would delay passage and risk going over the jobless benefits cliff on March 14,” one source said. Democrats want the COVID-19 bill signed into law by March 14, when enhanced unemployment benefits expire.A group of House progressives urged Biden on Monday to overrule the Senate parliamentarian, who determined last week that the $15 proposal could not pass by reconciliation.“This ruling is a bridge too far,” said Democratic Representative Ro Khanna. “If we don’t overrule the Senate parliamentarian, we are condoning poverty wages for millions of Americans.”The White House has previously ruled out intervening.Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said on Monday night he would introduce an amendment to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 in the final reconciliation bill, adding he believed the Senate should ignore the parliamentarian’s advice.“I am not sure, however, that my view at this point is the majority view in the Democratic Caucus,” Sanders said in a statement.The Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, told reporters that lawmakers should look for another venue to raise the minimum wage, but that “if it takes some 60 votes or a supermajority of some kind, it’s going to be very difficult, obviously.”To pass the relief plan, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris may have to cast a tie-breaking vote in a chamber where Republicans control 50 seats and Democrats and their allies control the other 50. Even that outcome depends on all the Democrats staying united behind the first major bill to come through Congress in the Biden administration.Democrats say the package is needed to fight a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Biden met with nine Senate Democrats on the coronavirus relief bill on Monday. One of them, Senator Jon Tester, told reporters they discussed “targeting” the funds in the legislation.“At least from my perspective, it wasn’t talking about reducing it, just targeting the money,” said Tester.Republicans in Congress, who broadly backed COVID-19 relief spending early in the pandemic, say the relief plan is too expensive and includes things like transportation projects that have nothing to do with relief for COVID-19. They also do not like the $35 billion included for pumping up government subsidies to defray the cost of premiums in the Obamacare health insurance program.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the measure on Monday as a “bonanza of partisan spending” that poorly targets the needs of American families, devotes only 1% of its spending to vaccines, delays the bulk of its school aid until after 2021 and includes policies that would drag down the economy.“This is where we are: a bad process, a bad bill, and a missed opportunity to do right by working families,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech.The Democratic measure includes funding to track the virus and distribute vaccines, and sends a new round of aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments.The big-ticket items include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, a $400-per-week federal unemployment benefit through Aug. 29 and help for those in difficulty paying rents and home mortgages during the pandemic.",Reuters

On Saturday and Sunday, less intense demonstrations shifted to the area near the presidential residence, in an affluent neighborhood of Asunción.Protesters and some lawmakers have called for Abdo to be impeached, though he still appears to have enough support to see off any challenge. However, he has been forced to shuffle his cabinet “in the interest of pacification”.On Monday he appointed a new Chief of Staff and confirmed doctor Julio Borba as the new health minister.An impeachment trial could only advance with the support of a group led by former President Horacio Cartes within the ruling Colorado Party. Its lawmakers said they would analyze the changes Abdo promised before making a decision.Paraguay early last year had kept infections very low, but COVID-19 cases jumped since September as activities resumed and have reached record numbers this month.The Health Ministry reported on Monday a new daily record of 1,817 cases and 25 deaths, which raised the total number of infections to 169,870 and deaths to 3,343.Latin America has seen a number of prominent health ministers forced out due to their handling of the pandemic, including in Peru, Argentina and Ecuador.",Reuters

The National Football League’s Super Bowl regularly draws an audience of around 100 million and is the highest-rated TV event in the United States.Sunday’s interview was the first given by the couple since they stepped back from the British royal family a year ago. Meghan spoke of feeling suicidal while Harry said his father, Prince Charles, had let him down.The interview will be broadcast in Britain on Monday night. Buckingham Palace has yet to comment on their remarks.It dominated the conversation on social media, morning television shows and newspaper front pages on Monday in Britain and abroad.The hashtag #HarryandMeghanonOprah was among the top five trending items worldwide on Twitter during and after the broadcast, while #Abolishthemonarchy was also buzzing, with 11,200 tweets.The couple’s interview covered not just their tensions with the royal family but also Harry’s disgust at the conduct of the British press, particularly the tabloids.Meghan and Harry’s revelations featured top in every British newspaper website, apart from the Financial Times, where it took a lower billing to the Bank of England governor.By lunchtime in London, Mail Online had 24 stories on the couple on its website. Its print stable-mate The Mail on Sunday published an 11-page special in anticipation of the broadcast. It recently lost a privacy lawsuit with Meghan.The Daily Express had more than 30 different stories online.Much of the coverage centered on the dramatic moment when Meghan said her son Archie, who will be two in May, had been denied the title of prince because there were concerns within the royal family “about how dark his skin might be when he’s born”.",Reuters

A jury was selected on Monday in a criminal case against a Honduran man who prosecutors say smuggled drugs into the United States with the help of President Juan Orlando Hernandez and other high-ranking officials.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corruption-honduras/jury-selected-in-u-s-drug-trial-involving-honduran-president-idUSKBN2B01CA,"NEW YORK CITY (Reuters) - A jury was selected on Monday in a criminal case against a Honduran man who prosecutors say smuggled drugs into the United States with the help of President Juan Orlando Hernandez and other high-ranking officials.Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez, 50, was arrested trying to leave Miami in 2020 and has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States and related weapons charges.According to the indictment in the case, Hernandez, who has been president since 2014, used Honduran law enforcement and military officials to protect drug traffickers, including Fuentes Ramirez.Hernandez, who is not named in the indictment, is labelled as co-conspirator 4, though his identity is clear.The president has strongly denied the allegations. He has often represented himself as tough on drugs, claiming credit for breaking up powerful crime cartels and extraditing numerous traffickers to the United States.Hernandez’s name was also mentioned in a criminal case against his brother Tony, who was convicted in Manhattan Federal Court of drug trafficking and related weapons charges in October 2019.In that trial, U.S. prosecutors said President Hernandez had accepted millions in bribes from drug traffickers. He has repeatedly denied the allegation.Hernandez was a key ally to the United States under both the Obama and the Trump administrations.The investigation will not only affect future bilateral relations but also complicate the new Biden administration’s efforts to invest $4 billion in Central America, including Honduras, to address the causes of migration.In a series of tweets on Monday, Hernandez said that drug traffickers were giving false testimony against him to U.S. authorities as revenge against his government and to reduce their own sentences. He warned of possible consequences.“I will maintain the international alliance in the fight against drug trafficking until the final day of my presidency,” Hernandez said on Twitter. “But if drug traffickers...win benefits from the United States for false testimony, the international alliance will collapse in Honduras and then in other countries.”Last month, thousands of Hondurans joined one of the largest-ever migrant caravans hoping to reach the United States, with many citing rampant violence, government corruption and worsening poverty as their reasons for leaving home.Democratic U.S. senators in late February introduced a bill that would sanction Hernandez for alleged drug trafficking and corruption and cut off financial assistance and ammunition sales to Honduran security forces.In addition to potentially shedding light on the extent of corruption and official involvement in drug trafficking in Honduras, revelations from Fuentes Ramirez’s trial could affect presidential primaries taking place in Honduras this month ahead of November’s election.Previous court filings in the case show that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration began investigating Hernandez and others for drug trafficking and money laundering around 2013, the year he was elected president after heading the parliament, or Congress.He was re-elected in a contested ballot in 2017 to hold office until early 2022.U.S. prosecutors in this case said in a February filing that the Honduran government has “hardly been forthcoming” with assistance in their investigations and said the government had not honored requests to extradite potential witnesses against the president.",Reuters

He added that he did not believe Brazilians wanted Lula to run next year.The office of Brazil’s prosecutor general said it will appeal the decision.Brazil’s real sank around 1.5% to a fresh four-month low after the news and the Bovespa stock index fell 4%. The real closed at 5.7779 per dollar, its weakest since May last year.Financial analysts said the prospect of Lula candidacy would likely drive Bolsonaro to abandon economic reforms he ran on in 2018 and further embrace populist measures to shore up support.“With Lula eligible, the chance of this current government going totally towards populism increases even more,” said Alfredo Menezes, managing partner at Armor Capital.Lula, 75, governed Latin America’s biggest country and largest economy between 2003 and 2011, overseeing a commodities boom that turbocharged economic growth.In 2018, he was convicted of taking bribes from engineering firms in return for public contracts and spent a year and a half behind bars, until the Supreme Court ruled he and others could appeal their cases without serving time.Lula and his supporters blasted the anti-corruption task force that brought him down, called Operation Car Wash, as a politically driven effort. Leaked conversations in 2019 raised questions about whether investigators had cut corners to secure prosecutions. The task force was disbanded in February.In a note, Lula’s legal team said the decision on Monday was recognition that the former president was innocent.His conviction had prevented him from running for another presidential term in 2018.The charismatic former union leader is a polarizing figure but still beloved by much of Brazil’s working class for bringing millions out of poverty through generous social welfare programs.Lula is the only one of 10 potential 2022 candidates who outperformed the president in a survey by polling company Ipec, published in newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo last week.It found that 50% of the 2,002 people it interviewed “would certainly” or “could” vote for Lula, compared with 38% for Bolsonaro. Some 44% of respondents said they would never vote for Lula, while 56% would never vote for Bolsonaro, the poll found.",Reuters

A U.S.-drafted peace plan for Afghanistan, reviewed by Reuters on Monday, calls for the current government to be replaced with an interim administration until a new constitution is agreed and elections held, while a joint commission monitors a ceasefire.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-peaceplan/u-s-proposes-interim-government-could-run-afghanistan-until-new-polls-idUSKBN2B02MQ,"WASHINGTON/KABUL (Reuters) - A U.S.-drafted peace plan for Afghanistan, reviewed by Reuters on Monday, calls for the current government to be replaced with an interim administration until a new constitution is agreed and elections held, while a joint commission monitors a ceasefire.The warring parties have long harbored deep objections to key ideas in the proposal, however.The U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, shared the “Transitional Peace Government” proposal last week with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, opposition and civil society leaders, and Taliban negotiators.Under the interim government, the national parliament could either be expanded to include Taliban members or suspended until after the election, the plan suggests. It also says that Afghanistan could “not host terrorists or permit terrorist-related activity on its soil” that threatens other countries, and that the Taliban would have to abandon safe havens and military ties “in neighboring countries.”Four political sources in Kabul who spoke on condition of anonymity, including a senior presidential palace official, confirmed the authenticity of a copy of the draft plan seen by Reuters. The plan has been reported by TOLO News and other Afghan outlets.State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Monday: “Every idea we have put on the table, every proposal that is out there ... we understand that this process, at its core, must be Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.”The new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden wants to revive stalled peace talks before May 1, when the last 2,500 U.S. troops must leave Afghanistan under a February 2020 deal struck between the Taliban and the former Trump administration.Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week proposed in a letter to Afghan leaders that Turkey hold a senior-level meeting “in the coming weeks to finalize a peace agreement.”Ghani has refused to step aside for a transitional government. The senior presidential palace official in Kabul echoed that on Monday: “We will never accept an interim set-up through a conference or a political deal.”The Taliban have rejected a ceasefire and elections. But a Taliban leader told Reuters that while the insurgents would not join an interim government, they were not opposed to one being formed.The U.S. draft calls for the establishment of a transitional government, including an “executive administration” chosen by the sides, “with special consideration for the meaningful inclusion of women and members of all ethnic groups.”The interim administration – under a president chosen by both sides – would run the country until elections could be held under a constitution drafted by a commission selected by both sides and the president.A nationwide ceasefire would be monitored by a joint commission, with each side selecting four members and a ninth named by the interim president. Three international observers would work with the commission, the draft says.Laurel Miller, a former acting U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the most “contentious” aspect of the U.S. plan is how power would be apportioned within the transitional government.Miller, who now works with the International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution organization, added that Taliban leaders “haven’t even revealed their starting positions in any substance, much less contemplated something like this.”",Reuters
166,"With gold-colored Trump statue, conservatives show fealty to former president
U.S. conservatives praised Donald Trump at an annual gathering on Friday, even unveiling a golden statue of the former president, showing he remains a Republican political force despite violent scenes in Washington last month.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-conservatives/with-gold-colored-trump-statue-conservatives-show-fealty-to-former-president-idUSKBN2AQ1GZ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. conservatives praised Donald Trump at an annual gathering on Friday, even unveiling a golden statue of the former president, showing he remains a Republican political force despite violent scenes in Washington last month.Prominent congressional conservatives - including Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley and Representatives Steve Scalise and Matt Gaetz - were among the Trump loyalists speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, which the former president will address on Sunday.“Let me tell you something: Donald Trump ain’t going anywhere,” said Cruz.Trump’s tumultuous final weeks in office saw his supporters launch a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to block Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s election victory, a win that Trump falsely claimed was tainted by widespread fraud.If there was any doubt that CPAC this year was devoted to Trump, the gold-colored statue of the former president, dressed in a jacket, red tie and Stars-and-Stripes boxing shorts, was on display at the conference site.Two participants wheeled the larger-than-life statue through the conference center lobby, according to a video on social media. It was unclear why the statue, showing a cartoonish version of Trump with an oversize head, was there.The statue drew instant derision online, with commentators comparing it to the golden calf that enraged the prophet Moses in the Old Testament.“Idol worship isn’t conservative. #RestoreOurGop,” Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 attack, said on Twitter.Gaetz declared himself part of the “pro-Trump, America First” wing of the conservative movement. “We’re not really a wing, we’re the whole body,” he said.He also appeared to forecast a future role for Trump, who is pondering another run for president in 2024: “Trump may not have drained the swamp all the way – yet.”U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican who may run for the party’s presidential nomination in 2024, sought to thread the needle between pledging loyalty to Trump and signaling his aspirations for higher office.He said “President Trump has flaws” but that he had made the party more approachable for working-class Americans.“We will not win the future by going back to where the Republican Party used to be,” Scott said. “If we do, we will lose the working base that President Trump so animated. We’re going to lose elections across the country and ultimately we’re going to lose our nation.”‘NOT THE PAST’Hawley, another possible 2024 candidate, called himself part of the future of the party.“We’re not the past, we’re the future. We represent the future of this country,” he said.Trump is expected to talk on Sunday about the future of the party and lay out policy differences within a group riven by differences in the wake of his chaotic four years in office.“The divide right now is between the ‘Beltway elites’ and the conservative grassroots around the country,” said a Trump adviser who helped prepare the speech.Trump will also offer red-meat rhetoric critical of his successor, Democrat President Joe Biden.Trump supporters at the conference on Friday repeated some of his false claims, arguing that they justified new restrictions on voting.In addition to the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, seven Senate Republicans voted to convict him of inciting insurrection, although the 57-43 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict.Many other senior Republicans did not attend this year’s event. They included former Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Representative Liz Cheney - another House Republican who voted to impeach.Some advisers say they want Trump not to use his speech to relitigate the election at length but instead offer a road map to Republicans’ regaining control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2022 congressional elections.CPAC is an event organized by the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, is close to Trump. It is a prime venue for speakers who want to gauge interest in whether they should run for president based on the enthusiasm they generate.",Reuters
167,Cuomo calls for outside review after second former aide alleges sexual misconduct,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-cuomo/cuomo-calls-for-outside-review-after-second-former-aide-alleges-sexual-misconduct-idUSKCN2AS028,"(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called on Saturday for an outside review following a report of sexual misconduct allegations against him by a second former aide, compounding problems for one of America’s most well-known Democratic politicians.Charlotte Bennett told the New York Times that Cuomo had asked her questions about her sex life, including whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men.Cuomo, in a statement, denied making sexual advances.Reuters has not independently verified the account and accusations by Bennett. She worked for the governor as an executive assistant and policy advisor for nearly two years until November 2020, according to her LinkedIn profile.“I was trying to be a mentor to her. I never made advances toward Ms. Bennett nor did I ever intend to act in any way that was inappropriate,” Cuomo said in a statement on Saturday.He called for “a full and thorough outside review” led by a former federal judge and said he would have no further comment until it was completed.Bennett did not immediately return a request for comment sent via Twitter.Cuomo rose to national prominence for his leadership at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when New York was the country’s COVID-19 epicenter.The latest accusations came just days after another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, wrote in an online essay that the governor made several “inappropriate gestures” toward her while she worked for the state government from 2015 to 2018.They ranged from sending her a rose on Valentine’s Day to kissing her on the mouth, she said.Boylan is now a candidate for Manhattan borough president.Cuomo denied those accusations in December and issued another denial this week. Multiple attempts to reach Boylan have been unsuccessful.Bennett, who is 25, told the Times that Cuomo said to her in one encounter in June that he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.Bennett said she discussed the interaction with Cuomo’s chief of staff Jill DesRosiers and was subsequently transferred to a job as a health policy advisor to the governor. She also provided a statement to a special counsel to the governor, Judith Mogul, in June, she told the Times.Beth Garvey, special counsel and senior advisor to Cuomo, said in a statement that Bennett had been “consulted regarding the resolution, and expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the way in which it was handled.”“The determination reached based on the information Ms Bennett provided was that no further action was required which was consistent with Ms Bennett’s wishes,” Garvey said.Allegations about his conduct with female aides follow another major controversy that has dogged Cuomo in recent weeks.A report from the state attorney general’s office last month cast doubt on the Cuomo administration’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis in nursing homes, saying that the state health department significantly undercounted the toll and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.A top aide to Cuomo later told lawmakers the administration had delayed providing requested data about COVID-19 death toll among nursing home residents for fear of a politically motivated investigation by the Justice Department under the then-president, Republican Donald Trump.",Reuters
168,Biden scores legislative win as House passes $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/biden-scores-legislative-win-as-house-passes-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-plan-idUSKBN2AQ1FT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden scored his first legislative win as the House of Representatives passed his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package early Saturday, though Democrats face challenges to their hopes of using the bill to raise the minimum wage.Democrats who control the chamber passed the sweeping measure by a mostly party-line vote of 219 to 212 and sent it on to the Senate, where Democrats planned a legislative maneuver to allow them to pass it without the support of Republicans.The American Rescue Plan would pay for vaccines and medical supplies and send a new round of emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments. The bill’s big-ticket items include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, a $400-per-week federal unemployment benefit through Aug. 29, and help for those in difficulty paying rents and home mortgages during the pandemic.In brief remarks on Saturday from the White House’s Roosevelt Room, Biden said he called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to thank her for her support and urged the Senate to take up the bill quickly.“I hope it will receive quick action. We have no time to waste,” Biden said, without taking questions. “The people of this country have suffered far too much for far too long.”Democrats said the package was needed to fight a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.“The American people need to know that their government is there for them,” Pelosi said in a debate on the House floor.Republicans, who have broadly backed previous COVID-19 spending, said much of the current package was not necessary, highlighting elements such as a subway near Pelosi’s San Francisco district. Only 9% of the total would go directly toward fighting the virus, they said.“It just throws out money without accountability,” House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said.Democrats pointed to a recent Quinnipiac University poll showing 68% of Americans supported the package, including 47% of Republicans, with just 37% of Republicans opposing it.“This critical legislation has support from Americans across the country and the political spectrum, and yet Republicans in Congress are trying to stand in the way,” said Jamie Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.The House vote amounted to a successful first test for Democrats, who hold a narrow 221-211 majority in the chamber. Progressives and moderates in the party who are often at odds will face tougher battles ahead on immigration and climate change initiatives that Biden wants to push.The president has focused his first weeks in office on tackling the greatest U.S. public health crisis in a century, which has upended most aspects of American life.Democrats aim to get the bill to him to sign into law before mid-March, when enhanced unemployment benefits and some other types of aid are due to expire.The action now moves to the Senate, where Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris may have to cast a tie-breaking vote in a chamber where Republicans control 50 seats and Democrats and their allies control the other 50.Democrats will have to sort out how to handle a proposed minimum-wage increase, which may have to be stripped from the bill due to the complicated rules that govern the Senate.The House-passed bill would raise the national hourly minimum wage for the first time since 2009, to $15 from $7.25. The increase is a top priority for progressive Democrats.However, the Senate’s rules expert said on Thursday that the wage hike did not qualify for special treatment that allows the rest of the bill to be passed with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the 100-seat chamber.Pelosi predicted the relief bill will pass Congress with or without the increase, and said Democrats would not give up on the matter.It is not clear whether the minimum-wage hike would have survived the Senate even if it were to be kept in the bill. At least two Senate Democrats oppose it, along with most Republicans.Some senators are floating a smaller increase, to the range of $10 to $12 per hour, while Democrats are considering a penalty for large corporations that do not voluntarily pay a $15 wage, according to a Democratic aide.Efforts to craft a bipartisan coronavirus aid bill fizzled early on, shortly after Biden was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, following a series of bipartisan bills enacted in 2020.",Reuters

The Biden administration is granting temporary protected status to Venezuelan migrants living in the United States and is also working to coordinate international pressure against President Nicolas Maduro to hold free and fair elections, senior U.S. officials said on Monday.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-usa/biden-grants-temporary-protected-status-to-venezuelans-in-u-s-who-fled-countrys-turmoil-idUSKBN2B02H9,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration is granting temporary protected status to Venezuelan migrants living in the United States and is also working to coordinate international pressure against President Nicolas Maduro to hold free and fair elections, senior U.S. officials said on Monday.The decision, which could aid an estimated 320,000 people, fulfills a promise that President Joe Biden made during the 2020 election campaign to give shelter to Venezuelans who left their homeland amid economic collapse, humanitarian crisis and political turmoil under Maduro.Venezuelans in the United States will have to show they have been residing in the country continuously as of March 8, 2021, to qualify for the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, the officials told reporters. If they meet the criteria, they will be given an 18-month reprieve to stay and can also obtain work permits.The decision stems from “extraordinary temporary conditions” in Venezuela, including “widespread hunger and malnutrition, growing presence and influence of non-state armed groups, a crumbling infrastructure,” one official said.“It is not safe for them to return,” the official added.Some 5.4 million Venezuelans have emigrated in recent years, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.When Biden took office on Jan. 20, he inherited from his predecessor, Donald Trump, an array of harsh sanctions that further tightened the economic noose on the OPEC state but failed to unseat Maduro.One of the administration officials reiterated the White House position, reported by Reuters late last month, that Biden is in “no rush” to lift sanctions on Venezuela.But the official stressed that Biden was moving away from the mostly unilateral approach of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign and coordinating more closely with international partners to force Maduro to hold free and fair elections.The official insisted that Maduro and his loyalists will find “no quarter anywhere” until they negotiate in earnest with the opposition. However, Maduro has shown no signs of giving ground.At the same time, the official said, Washington is reviewing Venezuela sanctions to make sure they are effective against intended targets and not “unnecessarily” punishing the Venezuelan people.Biden’s administration is continuing to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president. Dozens of countries have backed Guaido’s claim following Maduro’s re-election in 2018 in a vote Western governments called a sham, though cracks recently have appeared in Guaido’s international support.The Trump administration had resisted granting TPS to Venezuelans despite calls from Democrats and some Republicans. But on his last full day in office Trump issued an order temporarily blocking deportations of Venezuelans.Monday’s announcement appeared aimed in part at clearing up confusion surrounding Trump’s last-minute move and providing Venezuelans with formal legal status.Trump largely sought to phase out TPS for immigrants but was stymied by legal challenges. Biden has moved to reverse Trump’s hardline immigration policies.",Reuters

Escalating attacks like these are not the actions of a group that is serious about peace,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.“We understand that they face genuine security threats from Yemen and others in the region...We will look for ways to improve support for Saudi Arabia’s ability to defend its territory against threats,” Psaki told a Washington news briefing.Saudi-led coalition authorities said most of Sunday’s drones and missiles were intercepted en route to their targets and there were no casualties or property losses from the attacks.They targeted an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, site of a refinery and the world’s biggest offshore oil-loading facility, and a residential compound in Dhahran used by state-controlled oil giant Saudi Aramco. [L1N2L502H]The attacks, which drove Brent crude prices above $70 a barrel to their highest since January 2020, come at a time of friction in the decades-old alliance between Saudi Arabia and the United States as President Joe Biden puts pressure on Riyadh over its human rights record and the ruinous Yemen war.“The United States stands by Saudi Arabia and its people. Our commitment to defend the kingdom and its security is firm,” the U.S. Embassy said in an Arabic-language Twitter post.The Houthis have been battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for six years in a conflict largely regarded as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.In new incidents on Monday, the coalition said it had intercepted and destroyed a ballistic missile and an explosive drone fired towards parts of the kingdom’s southern region.The Houthi military claimed to have hit a military target at Saudi Arabia’s Abha airport, near the Yemen border, with a new type of ballistic missile.Saudi Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki, who also speaks for the coalition, said on Al Arabiya TV that Iran was smuggling missiles and drones to the Houthis. The Houthis and Tehran have in the past rejected such charges. [D5N2JU016]Riyadh has repeatedly said that Iran’s ballistic missile programme and support for regional proxies including in Yemen should be part of any talks aimed at reviving a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran that Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump quit.The Houthi movement said its operation on Sunday using 14 drones and eight ballistic missiles also attacked military targets in the Saudi cities of Dammam, Asir and Jazan.The coalition said it destroyed 12 Houthi drones, without specifying locations in the kingdom, and two ballistic missiles launched towards Jazan.The Saudi Defence Ministry later said it had intercepted an armed drone coming from the sea before it could hit its target at Ras Tanura. Shrapnel from a ballistic missile fell near the residential compound used by Aramco.The two sites in Eastern Province are located on the Gulf coast across from Iran and near Iraq and Bahrain, which is the regional base of the U.S. Navy. Yemen lies nearly 1,000 km (600 miles) southwest on the Gulf of Aden.Eastern Province has most of Aramco’s production and export facilities. In 2019, Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, was shaken by a big attack on oil installations just a few km (miles) from the facilities targeted on Sunday, which Riyadh blamed on Iran, an accusation Tehran denies.The 2019 attack, which was claimed by the Houthis but which Riyadh said did not originate from Yemen, forced Saudi Arabia to temporarily shut more than half of its crude output.The United States later sent American troops and military equipment to bolster the kingdom’s air and missile defences.The Houthis have stepped up attacks as the United States and United Nations have been pushing for a ceasefire to revive stalled Yemen peace talks. Biden has declared a halt to U.S. support for coalition offensive operations in Yemen but said Washington would continue to help Saudi Arabia defend itself.On Sunday, the Saudi-led coalition said the Houthis were emboldened after the Biden administration revoked terrorist designations on the group imposed by Trump.(This story corrects Jen Psaki’s job title to White House press secretary instead of U.S. State Department spokeswoman, paragraph 3)",Reuters

It will be co-chaired by Freeland and Associate Minister of Finance Mona Fortier.“Canada’s future prosperity and competitiveness depend on the ability of women to participate equally – and fully – in our workforce,” Freeland said in a statement. The panel was officially launched on International Women’s Day.Since being named finance minister in August, Freeland has repeatedly spoken about a “feminist agenda,” and has said a national childcare plan will be part of a stimulus package worth up to C$100 billion ($79 billion) over three years.That daycare strategy is one of the social infrastructure measures the panel will consider, and members say the timing is right for Canada to finally put in place a national program.“The issue of childcare is much more prominent today than it was before the pandemic,” said Morna Ballantyne, executive director of the Child Care Now advocacy group and a panel member. “There is this consensus that the status quo is not working.”“It’s going to take significant resources - financial resources - and it’s not a quick project. It’s going to require a commitment to sustained, long-term funding,” she added.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said stimulus is needed to jump-start Canada’s post-pandemic recovery.“This crisis has created a she-cession and has threatened to roll back the hard-fought social and economic progress of all women,” Trudeau said in a statement.“To build a fairer and more equal Canada, we must ensure a feminist, intersectional recovery from this crisis.”Trudeau campaigned in 2015 as a feminist and he has maintained a gender-balanced Cabinet since his election. But he was criticized for getting rid of his former attorney general - the first Indigenous woman to hold the position - amid a dispute over how she handled a corporate corruption case.Canadian women are more likely than men to have lost jobs in the pandemic, and three times more women than men have left the labor force entirely since February 2020. Mothers, racialized women and young women have all been disproportionately affected.Maya Roy, chief executive of YWCA Canada and another panel member, echoed that childcare needs to be top of mind when looking at how to restart the economy.She also pointed to the importance of tapping underemployed immigrant women who have trained for skilled work abroad, but whose training is not recognized in Canada.“We have highly skilled doctors and nurses and respiratory techs right here in Canada delivering pizzas and driving Ubers,” she said.($1 = 1.2657 Canadian dollars)",Reuters

Israel's El Al airlines launched a pilot programme at its Tel Aviv airport check-in counters on Monday to test unvaccinated passengers for COVID-19 before allowing them to board a non-stop flight to New York.

All 112 passed the test.Airlines have for months been lobbying governments for such measures to prevent people from having to go into quarantine on arrival.With some 40 percent of Israelis over the age of 16 already fully vaccinated after their second dose of Pfizer /BioNTech’s vaccine, most of those tested at the airport were children, who under current health guidelines are not given the shots.“He was good. He only cried for a second,” said the mother of a 10-month-old after the nose swab by a medical team stationed in front of the check-in desk.For 5-year-old Hili Lazarof, the test was “okay”.The aim of the test was to ensure no one on the plane carried the coronavirus or could infect others. But masks were still mandatory for the duration of the 12-hour flight.“What we are trying to do in this concept is basically taking three layers of protection for the passengers,” El Al Chief Executive Avigal Soreq told Reuters.He was referring to government-issued vaccination certificates issued in Israel’s world-leading inoculation rollout, PCR tests which all Ben Gurion airport passengers must take up to 72 hours before takeoff, and the rapid-result swab.Such testing could reduce social distancing that limits turnover at airports and cramps passenger comfort, and allow business as usual for duty-free shops and restaurants, said Leehu Hacohen, El Al’s vice president for operations.“Today’s flight is, I think, the first in the world where you will know that you have verified that everyone onboard is certainly clean and non-coronavirus contagious,” he told Israel’s Army Radio.Some passengers were annoyed they had to have another test after a negative result in their PCR swab, grumbling to ticket agents about a wait that took a bit longer than the promised 15 minutes.But Hodaya Meshita, 27, from Savannah, Georgia said about her rapid test: “It’s uncomfortable for a few seconds.” She has had only one dose of a two-shot vaccine so far.Soreq said El Al would likely carry out similar swabbing in New York next week and then see whether to add the process to other flights as the airline and Israel’s tourism industry struggle to recover from the pandemic.",Reuters

179,"Analysis: Urban states come out ahead, rural states get less in Biden's COVID-19 relief bill
(This Feb. 24 story refiles to reflect Democratic-leaning states in paragraph 2)",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-states-analysi/analysis-urban-states-come-out-ahead-rural-states-get-less-in-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-idUSKBN2AO183,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package now making its way through the U.S. Congress would provide $350 billion to help pandemic-hit state and local governments balance their budgets, more than twice the amount lawmakers approved last year.But not every state comes out ahead: urban, Democratic-led states like Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts that took drastic steps to stop the coronavirus’ spread would get about three times as much money per person as they did in the package passed at the beginning of the health crisis in March.Rural, Republican-led states including Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota that did less would see less cash.That’s because Congress is giving greater weight to poverty and unemployment this time as it considers how to distribute money to keep police, firefighters and other public employees on the job during a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.It also reflects the fact that Democrats who control both chambers of Congress drafted the package for their fellow Democrat President Joe Biden without Republican input.Under the new bill, named the American Rescue Plan, 61% of the aid would end up in states that voted for Biden in November, up from 56% in the bipartisan CARES Act passed last March.Reuters examined House Oversight Committee projections on how much direct fiscal aid each state would receive in the bill, which is set for a vote in the House of Representatives this week before moving to the Senate.It is expected to pass, even if no Republicans vote for it.The CARES Act distributed $140 billion to state and local governments based on population, delivering a minimum of $1.25 billion to each state. That gave the largest per-capita benefits to the states with the smallest populations, including Wyoming and Vermont. Another $3 billion was set aside for Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories.This time around, Democrats have lowered the per-state minimum to $500 million. The remaining $300 billion would be allocated based on unemployment and poverty levels as well as population. Tribal governments and territories would get $24.5 billion. Washington, D.C., would be treated like a state.Advocates say the new formula ensures the money goes where it is needed, as COVID-19’s toll has been uneven across the country. Unemployment in December topped 9% in tourism-dependent Nevada and Hawaii, triple the 3% in Nebraska and South Dakota.“This is a more targeted approach,” said Michael Leachman, a budget expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who supports additional state and local aid.Republicans say the bill short-changes states that have imposed fewer coronavirus-related restrictions.“The real reason for this bill is to send billions to bail out blue-state governors and reward their harmful lockdown policies,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri said at a House Budget Committee hearing on Monday.The new bill would direct roughly $800 per person to Republican-led Utah and Alabama, which had some of the least restrictive COVID-19 responses, according to Oxford University researchers.It would send roughly $1,200 per person to Democratic-led Massachusetts and New York, among the most restrictive.Democrats argue that the money should be targeted towards areas that have suffered the most.“Since when is unemployment not a legitimate indicator of economic distress?” Representative David Price, a Democrat from North Carolina, said at the same hearing.State and local aid has proven to be one of the most divisive aspects of the multi-trillion dollar effort Washington has mounted in the past year to fight the virus and keep the world’s largest economy afloat.Republicans and Democrats both broadly supported small-business loans and direct payments to families.But Republicans have balked at providing more aid to state and local governments. State and local aid was excluded from a bipartisan $900 billion bill that passed in December.The National Association of State Budget Officers calculated state revenues would drop 10.8% in the current fiscal year when compared with pre-pandemic estimates, affecting Republican-led and Democratic-led states alike.Some analysts say the Democrats’ proposal, which adds up to about $500 billion when spending for public schools, transit and other aid is included, provides states with more than they need, however.“People dramatically overestimated how bad the state and local finances would be,” Stan Veuger, an economist at the center-right American Enterprise Institute.Bipartisan groups like the National Governors Association have argued that further aid is needed to help states deliver health care and education and avoid further layoffs that could prolong the recovery, though they have not endorsed specific proposals.Though the new bill would steer more money towards large states, smaller states still fare well. Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota, each with fewer than 1 million residents, are still among the top 10 recipients on a per capita basis.",Reuters

We’re going to consult with our congressional allies, congressional leaders today to talk about a path forward about how we can make progress urgently on what is an urgent issue.

They included the increase in his coronavirus relief bill to help tackle the heavy human and economic toll of the pandemic, which has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Democrats are trying to advance the COVID-19 bill under a special “budget reconciliation” process that would allow them to pass it in the Senate using a simple majority, so they will not need Republican support.But there are rules that limit what can be included using that process, and it is the job of Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough to determine what is allowed.“This decision reinforces reconciliation cannot be used as a vehicle to pass major legislative change - by either party - on a simple majority vote,” Graham wrote on Twitter.The negative ruling does not mean the idea of raising the minimum wage is dead. Proponents could seek to pass a separate bill without using the reconciliation process, but they presumably would need Republican support.Two Senate Republicans, Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney, on Tuesday proposed increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour.Not all Democrats favor a $15 wage. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, has suggested raising the wage to $11 over two years.The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. It was last raised in 2009.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the Senate parliamentarian’s ruling that the $15 minimum wage would be still included when the Democratic-controlled chamber takes up the relief bill on Friday.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed 59% of respondents saying they supported raising the minimum wage to $15, with 34% opposed.",Reuters

They should block murderers, not us,” said Ipek Deniz, a 36-year-old nurse participating in the protests.The femicide rate roughly doubled between 2011 and 2019, according to a group that monitors murders of women, which also said that so far in 2021, 51 women have been murdered and another 26 have died under suspicious circumstances.Turkey does not keep official statistics on femicide.At the weekend, a video showing a woman being punched and kicked in the head by her ex-husband on the street in northern Turkey sparked outrage on social media.

Lebanon's president told the army and security forces on Monday to clear roadblocks after a week of protests over a collapsing economy and paralysed government, but the army chief warned that troops should not get sucked into the political deadlock.

What are you waiting for? What are you planning to do?” he said in a statement, urging them to find long-lasting solutions to stop the country’s financial meltdown.One political source said tension between the president and army commander grew after the request to clear roads.Since the Lebanese pound, which has lost 85% of its value, tumbled to a new low last week, protesters have blocked roads daily.But there have not been reports of violent confrontations between the security, army and protesters during the week.General Aoun on Monday warned against pulling the army into political bickering.“The fragmentation of the army means the end of the entity, this is impossible to let happen. The army is holding together and the experience of ‘75 will not be repeated,” he said.The army has long been billed as a rare institution of national pride and unity. Its collapse at the start of Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war, when it split along sectarian lines, catalyzed Lebanon’s descent into militia rule.Monday’s meeting at the presidency also stipulated a crackdown on anyone violating monetary and credit laws, including foreign exchange bureaus, a statement by the president’s office said.As Lebanon’s financial crisis erupted in late 2019, a wave of mass protest rocked the country, with outrage boiling over at leaders who have overseen decades of state graft.Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost, bank accounts have been frozen and many have been plunged into poverty.On Monday, three main roads leading south into the capital were blocked while in Beirut itself, protesters briefly closed a road in front of the central bank.“We have said several times that there will be an escalation because the state isn’t doing anything,” said Pascale Nohra, a protester on a main highway in the Jal al-Dib area.By Monday evening, Jal al-Dib protesters had set up tents with some saying they would spend the night in the street.In Tyre in the south, one man tried to burn himself by pouring gasoline on his body but civil defence members stopped him in time, the state news agency said.In Tripoli in the north, one of Lebanon’s poorest cities, demonstrators built a brick wall one metre high to prevent cars from passing through, while allowing a pathway for emergency cases.“The new developments on the financial and security fronts must be tackled quickly,” the presidency statement said.After a port explosion devastated whole tracts of Beirut in August and killed 200 people, Caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s government resigned and stayed on in a caretaker capacity until a new cabinet is formed. But the new prime minister-designate, Saad al-Hariri, is at loggerheads with President Aoun and has been unable to form a new government to carry out the needed reforms to unlock international aid.On Saturday, Diab threatened to quit even caretaker work to try to push for the formation of a new government.Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai hit at politicians in his Sunday sermon: “How can the people not revolt when the price of one dollar has surpassed 10,000 Lebanese pounds in one day, how can they not revolt when the minimum wage is $70?”Rai has called for an U.N.-sponsored international conference to help Lebanon.",Reuters

Winfrey later told CBS that Harry had said it was not Queen Elizabeth or her husband Philip.Harry said his family had cut them off financially and his father Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, had let him down and refused to take his calls at one point.Buckingham Palace was not expected to give an immediate response to the interview, which aired in the early hours of Monday morning in Britain.The two-hour broadcast was the most anticipated royal interview since Harry’s late mother Princess Diana shared intimate details of her failed marriage to Charles in 1995, denting the heir’s reputation and the family’s standing in the eyes of the British public.Nearly three years since her star-studded wedding in Windsor Castle, Meghan described some unidentified members of the royal household as brutal, mendacious and guilty of racist remarks.She also accused Kate, wife of her husband’s elder brother Prince William, of making her cry before her wedding.While the family came in for open criticism, neither Harry nor Meghan attacked the 94-year-old queen directly.Still, Meghan said she had been silenced by “the Firm” - which Elizabeth heads - and that her pleas for help while in distress at racist reporting and her predicament had fallen on deaf ears.“I just didn’t want to be alive any more. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. And I remember how he (Harry) just cradled me,” Meghan said, wiping away tears.‘REALLY LET DOWN’Harry and Meghan’s announcement in January 2020 that they intended to step down from their royal roles plunged the family into crisis. Last month, Buckingham Palace confirmed the split would be permanent, as the couple looks to forge an independent life in the United States.Harry, 36, said they had stepped back from royal duties because of a lack of understanding, and he was worried about history repeating itself - a reference to the death of his mother Diana who was killed in a 1997 crash as her car sped away from chasing photographers.Asked what his mother would say about events, he answered: “I think she would feel very angry with how this has panned out and very sad.” He felt “really let down” by his father.Harry denied blindsiding Queen Elizabeth, his grandmother, with his decision to shun life within the monarchy, but said Prince Charles stopped taking his calls at one point.“I had three conversations with my grandmother, and two conversations with my father before he stopped taking my calls. And then he said, can you put this all in writing?”Detractors say the couple, whose official title is the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, wanted the limelight, but were not willing to live with the attention and scrutiny it brought.To supporters, their treatment shows how an outdated British institution lashed out against a modern, independent biracial woman.“I know first-hand the sexism and racism institutions and the media use to vilify women and people of color to minimize us, to break us down and to demonize us,” Serena Williams, one of the world’s most successful tennis players and friend of Meghan’s, said on Twitter.Amanda Gorman, the poet who wowed viewers at the inauguration of U.S. President Joe Biden, said on Twitter Meghan had been the “Crown’s greatest opportunity for change, regeneration, and reconciliation in a new era. They didn’t just maltreat her light - they missed out on it.”There have also been allegations of bullying against Meghan which appeared in The Times newspaper in the buildup to the couple’s appearance. Buckingham Palace said it would investigate the claims, adding it was “very concerned”.Meghan told Winfrey people within the royal institution not only failed to protect her against malicious claims but lied to protect others.“It was only once we were married and everything started to really worsen that I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family,” Meghan said.Meghan denied a newspaper story that she had made Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, cry before the wedding and said it was a turning point in her relations with the media and the palace.“The reverse happened,” Meghan said. “A few days before the wedding she (Kate) was upset about something, pertaining to yes the issue was correct about the flower girl dresses, and it made me cry. And it really hurt my feelings.”Meghan, who said they were not paid for the interview, conceded she had not realised what she was marrying into when she joined the British monarchy and “went into it naively”.The couple also revealed that Meghan, who is pregnant with their second child, was expecting a girl.Harry said Meghan had “saved” him from his trapped royal life. “I would disagree, I think he saved all of us. You made a decision that certainly saved my life,” Meghan said.“This is in some ways just the beginning for us.”",Reuters

At this point, for anyone to come forward and speak about their own struggles with mental health and tell their own personal story that takes courage, that’s certainly something the president believes,” she told reporters.“Let me just reiterate that we have a strong and abiding relationship with the British people and a special partnership with the government of the United Kingdom on a range of issues and that will continue.”“The monarchy has just been hit by its worst crisis since the abdication in 1936. Whether for the sake of Britain or for the sake of the younger royals this rotten institution needs to go.”“Meghan Markle, my selfless friend, lives her life - and leads by example - with empathy and compassion. She teaches me every day what it means to be truly noble. Her words illustrate the pain and cruelty she’s experienced.”“Meghan was the Crown’s greatest opportunity for change, regeneration, and reconciliation in a new era. They didn’t just maltreat her light - they missed out on it.”BERNICE KING, YOUNGEST CHILD OF THE LATE U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.“Royalty is not a shield from the devastation and despair of racism.”NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE, THE BIGGEST U.S. HOTLINE FOR PEOPLE CONTEMPLATING TAKING THEIR OWN LIVES“By sharing her personal experience with crisis and how she got through it, the Duchess reminds us all that we are not alone, and that help is available.”“The UK media is not bigoted and will not be swayed from its vital role holding the rich and powerful to account following the attack on the press by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.”“This interview is an absolutely disgraceful betrayal of the Queen and the Royal Family. I expect all this vile destructive self-serving nonsense from Meghan Markle - but for Harry to let her take down his family and the Monarchy like this is shameful.”“The duchess is a formidable communicator and has proved herself a very bad woman to pick a fight with,” he wrote in an online analysis.“But alongside the personal pain and anger rippling through the duchess’s testimony, there came from Harry condemnation of the institution - the suggestion that it was incapable of change, incapable of love, incapable of understanding.”“The echoes of Diana in this whole situation are extraordinary.”“It’s really sort of seismic to hear a member of the royal family say that she herself felt that much in crisis.”“You know why Black women believe Meghan? Because we know exactly what micro aggressions look like. And how they slowly drive you insane.”BRITTANY PACKNETT CUNNINGHAM, U.S. BLACK ACTIVIST AND PODCAST HOST“The difference in treatment between Meghan and Kate is one of the clearest examples of the misogynoir at play & is a reminder that if they can do that to a Duchess, it’s happening to Black women *everyday*.”",Reuters

Joining hundreds of women in Istanbul to protest at China's treatment of Uighurs, Nursiman Abdurasit tearfully thinks of her jailed mother in Xinjiang and fears that Uighurs like her in Turkey may one day be sent back under an extradition deal.

Last summer she discovered her parents and two brothers had been given long jail sentences on suspicion of unspecified “terrorism-related activities”.“I have been living with the knowledge that my mother has been in a detention centre for the last four years, experiencing repression,” she said at a protest to mark Women’s Day on an Istanbul seafront, near China’s Istanbul consulate.The headscarved 32-year-old said she recalled International Women’s Day was her mother’s happiest day, when the family would give her presents, until she received the 13-year jail sentence.Around her, the 1,000-strong crowd held up photos of missing relatives and waved the blue-and-white flags of the independence movement of East Turkestan, the name by which the movement refers to Xinjiang.U.N. experts estimate at least a million Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centres in northwest China’s Xinjiang region and the United States said in January China has committed “genocide and crimes against humanity” by repressing Uighurs.China denies accusations of abuses in Xinjiang, and has said the complexes it set up in the region provided vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism.“China says that what we are doing is a crime, ‘what you are doing is separatism, disparaging the state’,” said Abdurasit, voicing concern about the consequences of the extradition deal waiting in a Turkish parliamentary commission.“If this agreement is ratified, we could be extradited for this crime. So we are worried,” said the woman, who lives in a small Istanbul flat with her Uighur husband and six-year-old daughter.Worries among Uighur Muslims living in Turkey have been exacerbated by Ankara’s dependence on China for COVID-19 vaccines, having received 15 million doses from China’s Sinovac Biotech and ordered tens of millions more.However, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has denied that the extradition agreement would lead to Uighurs being sent back, describing it as a routine according similar to ones Turkey has with other countries.A Chinese embassy spokesperson said last month that Uighurs who have been holding regular protests near China’s diplomatic premises in Turkey in recent months were trying to deceive Turkish people and damage bilateral relations.“These people’s aim with their made-up lies is to attack the Chinese government’s Xinjiang policies, blacken China’s image and exploit the problems related to Xinjiang,” he said.The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the protest on Monday.",Reuters

A 60-year-old recovering from breast cancer, Paris resident Nadine Roger is at high-risk from COVID-19 and wants to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Yet when she was offered the vaccine manufactured by AstraZeneca she turned it down.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-france-astrazeneca/science-says-its-safe-but-some-in-france-dont-trust-astrazeneca-vaccine-idUSKBN2B01K3,"PARIS (Reuters) - A 60-year-old recovering from breast cancer, Paris resident Nadine Roger is at high-risk from COVID-19 and wants to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Yet when she was offered the vaccine manufactured by AstraZeneca she turned it down.“The AstraZeneca (shot) frightens me,” she said. Roger, a medical technician, said she would wait instead for the shot made by U.S. firm Johnson & Johnson, which has not yet been approved by European regulators.According to the most recent data made available by the French health ministry, for the end of February, France was using 24% of its AstraZeneca doses, compared with 82% for vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and 37% for the Moderna shot.That is partly due to logistical bottlenecks, but also because some French people don’t trust the AstraZeneca shot - despite multiple scientific studies that indicate it is safe and effective - according to interviews Reuters conducted with eight people involved in France’s vaccine rollout.They said some of those offered the vaccine were worried about side-effects, sceptical it was effective against new variants of COVID-19, and confused by shifting evidence on how well it works for older people.The AstraZeneca vaccine had a bumpy genesis.European regulators recommended it not be used for people over 65, citing a lack of data. French President Emmanuel Macron was quoted as saying the shot was “quasi-ineffective” and the French regulator called on hospitals to stagger inoculations of their staff after side effects led frontline workers to call in sick.“All that sent out the wrong signal to health workers, but also the rest of the population,” said Jacques Battistoni, head of the largest general practitioners’ union in France.To be sure, France is one of the most vaccine-sceptic countries globally, though surveys have showed the proportion of the public intending to get inoculated increasing.Like other wealthy countries, France has made the AstraZeneca shot a pillar of its vaccine rollout. With all the big vaccine makers experiencing production problems, countries cannot afford for people to snub one of the shots.A health ministry official and two doctors involved in the rollout said the uptake was accelerating as logistics improve and people get used to the AstraZeneca shot.AstraZenaca doses were initially to be delivered to hospitals and vaccination centres for the inoculation of healthcare workers, and to general practitioners for the vaccination of 50- to 64-year-olds with pre-existing conditions.In the first week of the AstraZenaca rollout, which coincided with the start of school holidays, GPs ordered fewer than half of their allocated doses.The president of AstraZeneca France, Olivier Nataf, told the weekly Journal du Dimanche at the weekend that his company’s vaccine was entirely effective against severe COVID-19 infections and 80% effective in preventing hospitalizations.“Confusions and disappointments can arise. Many are already resolved,” he told the newspaper. “There may be others. But the enemy remains the pandemic. Any controversy diminishes our ability to overcome it.”European regulators have concluded the side-effects cause by the AstraZenaca vaccine are not a cause to doubt its safety. A study in Scotland covering 5.4 million people showed it, and the Pfizer vaccine, were highly effective in preventing severe infections.France, Germany and Italy have changed tack and are now giving the vaccine to people over 65.Macron said last month the AstraZeneca jab was effective, and he would take it if offered.‘SECOND-RATE VACCINE’But some doubts linger. Malika, a 54-year-old who works in a clinic for homeless people near Paris, said she turned down the AstraZeneca vaccine when offered it.“I thought to myself: ‘I don’t really see the point of getting vaccinated with a second-rate vaccine’,” said Malika, who did not want her family name published.She said her mind was made up when a colleague had the shot and experienced side-effects. Malika said wanted to have the Pfizer jab, currently reserved for over-75s, instead.Roger, the cancer survivor, said she lived alone, so was worried about coming down with a fever, one of the possible side-effects from COVID-19 vaccines, and had doubts about the AstraZeneca vaccine’s efficacy against new variants.But the big drawback, she said, was that she would have to wait until getting a second AstraZeneca shot in May to feel fully protected, an issue that would not arise with the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine.She has been to Yemen, Mali, and Madagascar, and the shelves of her home are decorated with artefacts she brought home. Since her cancer diagnosis, she said she realised she needed to make the most of the time she has, and get back on the road.“Right now, AstraZeneca doesn’t allow me to do that.”",Reuters

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Monday China's planned changes to the electoral system, denounced by pro-democracy activists, could further delay a vote for the city's legislature, but she was still uncertain on the timing.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security/hong-kongs-lam-says-chinas-planned-electoral-changes-could-prompt-another-vote-delay-idUSKBN2B00B7,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Monday China’s planned changes to the electoral system, denounced by pro-democracy activists, could further delay a vote for the city’s legislature, but she was still uncertain on the timing.China’s rubber-stamp parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), is expected to approve on Thursday a resolution that will reduce democratic representation in Hong Kong institutions and vet any candidates for “patriotism”.The measures will tweak the size and composition of Hong Kong’s legislature and the committee selecting the chief executive further in favour of pro-Beijing figures. The electoral committee will also be given powers to select many legislators.Critics have decried Beijing’s moves as the end of democratic dreams in the former British colony, whose mini-constitution states universal suffrage as its goal.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies interference.Speaking after attending last week’s opening of the NPC in Beijing, Lam said the changes “logically” mean that a vote for the Legislative Council needs to take place after an election for the members of the electoral committee, currently scheduled for December.“I’m not yet in a position to tell you whether we could adhere to September 5, 2021, as a day for the general election of the Legislative Council,” Lam told reporters.The vote was initially scheduled for September 2020, but delayed for at least a year, with the government citing the coronavirus.Riding high after the 2019 protests, the pro-democracy opposition had slim hopes for an unprecedented majority in the city’s mini-parliament.But Beijing has since moved swiftly to reassert its control, imposing a sweeping national security law in June and authorities have since arrested most high-profile opposition politicians and activists.With any public office holders now set to be vetted for their “patriotism”, political parties disbanding, democratic politicians either in jail or in exile and institutions stacked with pro-Beijing figures, it is unclear what room there will be left for any opposition.A bipartisan group of senior U.S. lawmakers said it was “deeply concerned” by the electoral changes and urged the Biden administration to use tools provided for in legislation of the past two years to support Hong Kong people and to work with allies to develop other mechanisms - an apparent call for more sanctions.“These revisions will only continue to advance Beijing’s ever tightening grip on Hong Kongers’ autonomy, basic freedoms, and fundamental human rights,” said a statement from the lawmakers led by Senator Ed Markey, chairman of the Senate’s East Asia Subcommittee.The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over the Hong Kong crackdown and announced an end to the special economic treatment the territory had long enjoyed under U.S. law.Last week, the U.S. State Department called China’s Hong Kong moves a direct attack on its autonomy and said Washington was working to rally countries with the aim of “galvanizing collective action” against Chinese abuses.",Reuters
191,"France fells oaks to rebuild the Notre-Dame spire
In a former royal forest, tree surgeons on Monday began felling centuries-old oak trees which will be used to rebuild the wooden-framed spire of Notre-Dame de Paris after it was destroyed by fire.

192,"In Pennsylvania, Republican rift over Trump imperils party’s election chances
C. Arnold McClure chairs the Republican Party in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - deep in Trump country - and wants to punish fellow conservatives who have turned against the former president.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-pennsylvania-insight/in-pennsylvania-republican-rift-over-trump-imperils-partys-election-chances-idUSKBN2AP2J7,"EXTON, Pa. (Reuters) - C. Arnold McClure chairs the Republican Party in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - deep in Trump country - and wants to punish fellow conservatives who have turned against the former president.McClure is among those pushing the state party to censure Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, for voting this month to convict Donald Trump, at his second impeachment trial, of inciting the U.S. Capitol riots. McClure will apply the same standard to any Republican candidate in upcoming elections who seeks support in his rural county: Those who have defended Trump will pass “our first litmus test,” he said. He has a simple question for any who have not: “What the hell?”Other Pennsylvania party leaders say that’s a great way to keep losing elections - after Republicans ceded the White House and control of both houses of Congress to Democrats under Trump’s watch. Shunning Trump’s Republican critics “sends a wrong signal to many of those that are independents or leaning Republican,” said Sam DeMarco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh.Those dueling views encapsulate the rift among Republicans in Pennsylvania and nationally that some party leaders, along with opinion polls, suggest could imperil its chances in the 2022 congressional elections. Interviews with two dozen Republican officials, activists and political analysts reveal a deep split over strategy in Pennsylvania - a key battleground that could determine whether Republicans retake the Senate next year.Republicans face a potentially self-destructive dynamic in statewide races: Trump loyalists may well prevail over moderate candidates in party primaries, but they are more likely to lose general campaigns against Democrats by turning off centrist voters.“If that primary is going to be a race to the extreme right - and a race to see who is most loyal to Donald Trump - I guarantee you it will be extremely difficult for the Republican Party to win,” said Gene DiGirolamo, a Republican county commissioner in Bucks County - a Philadelphia suburb - and a former state representative.A growing number of Republican voters are unhappy with the party’s direction, according to a Feb. 18-24 Reuters/Ipsos poll. Nearly half – 48% – of self-identified Republicans believe their party “has lost its way,” up 17 percentage points from a similar poll in December. A Reuters review of Pennsylvania state data shows more than 22,000 voters had left the party this year through Feb. 22, compared with fewer than 8,000 Democrats.Still, many party leaders argue that turning against Trumpism isn’t the way forward. Sean Gale, an attorney and fierce Trump backer who has announced a run for Toomey’s seat, said the party has tried and failed to win elections with centrist candidates.“Running a moderate, or a ‘Democrat-light’ Republican, to attract independents and Democrats is a proven recipe for disaster,” he said in an email. “The GOP tried this in 2008 with John McCain and 2012 with Mitt Romney.”Trump lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes in November, four years after his upset victory there in 2016. The former president nonetheless remains the de facto leader of the Republican Party. Trump will deliver his first speech since leaving office at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday in Orlando, Fla.Trump spokesman Jason Miller did not respond to a request for comment. A Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump plans to use his political action committee as a “weapon” against more moderate Republicans in next year’s elections.“He’s still going to have an enormous amount of influence on both the direction of the policy and also in evaluating who is a serious standard-bearer for that message,” the adviser said.The Republican Party’s state committee in Pennsylvania met on Wednesday to consider censuring Toomey, but the vote was derailed after a glitch with its electronic balloting system. The party had not yet rescheduled the vote early Thursday.Trump’s brash brand of politics will be on display this Saturday in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, when Lauren Boebert - the gun-toting freshman congresswoman from Colorado - will address gun rights at a party fundraiser.Boebert, a fierce Trump backer, has amplified his false election-fraud claims. She’s also boosted ticket sales for the Pennsylvania fundraiser, said Robert Arena, the county party’s executive director.“The congresswoman is a rising name,” he said.Arena and some other Republican leaders downplayed the party rift, arguing it will be more united for the 2022 campaigns after more than a year under Democratic control in Washington.A pivotal question: Who will they unite behind? Polls suggest Trump’s popularity has faded. About 7 in 10 Republicans approved of Trump in a Jan. 8-12 Reuters/Ipsos poll taken during his last month in office, down from as high as 9 in 10 last year.Still, no other Republican comes close to being perceived as the party’s standard-bearer. Reuters/Ipsos polling between Feb. 18 and 24 asked Republican voters to pick from a list of prominent Republicans, not including Trump, who they thought embodied the qualities of an American leader. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a chief Trump backer, polled highest, at 22%. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - who has recently blasted Trump over his role in the Capitol riots - was favored by just 3%, the same as firebrand congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been widely criticized for promoting conspiracy theories.REPUBLICAN CIVIL WAR ‘CANCELED’Asked about the attempt to censure Toomey, the party’s national Senate campaign organization pointed to comments this week from Senator Rick Scott, its chairman, declaring that the “Republican civil war has been cancelled.”“Those fanning these flames, in both the media and our own ranks, desire a GOP civil war,” he wrote in a memo. “No, we don’t have time for that.”The infighting won’t be so easy to wish away, said John Kennedy, a political science professor at West Chester University in Chester County. The increasingly Trumpian base of Republican voters, he said, will make it difficult for any moderate to win Pennsylvania’s party primaries, in which only Republicans vote.Some analysts and moderate Republicans noted that the party tried nominating Trump-like candidates for Senate and governor in 2018, and they lost by double digits. Others compared the current insurgency to the Tea Party movement that divided Republicans a decade ago, when Tea Party-backed candidates were blamed for party losses in Senate elections.Howard Merrick, the chairman of the Republican committee in Schuylkill County, a Trump stronghold, said that voters leaving the party are not necessarily just anti-Trump moderates. They also include Trump supporters who are furious with his Republican critics - and who still believe Trump’s claims that he lost a rigged election.“There are people who are very, very mad at everything that happened,” he said. “Most are mad at Congress - those senators like Toomey who have not stood up for Trump.”Yet Merrick believes the effort to censure Toomey would only further undermine the party. “It hurts us to do this,” he said.Toomey’s Senate seat in Pennsylvania is up for grabs because he has announced he will not run for re-election in 2022.The Senate is currently divided 50-50, with Democrats in power because Vice President Kamala Harris has the tie-breaking vote. Losing in Pennsylvania - widely seen as the most competitive 2022 Senate race - would make it much harder for Republicans to retake the chamber.The changing perception of Toomey, who declined an interview request, illustrates the party’s shift toward Trumpism. Once considered a reliable conservative, he’s now reviled as a traitor among some Trump backers. Toomey launched his first Senate run in 2004 against incumbent Republican Arlen Specter, who was ridiculed back then as a “RINO” – a Republican in Name Only, an insult now hurled at Toomey.Many Republicans’ demands for absolute loyalty to Trump worry Ryan Costello, a moderate former Republican congressman and Trump critic who is close to launching a bid for Toomey’s seat.“They’re demanding absolutism,” Costello said of Trump’s political operation. “If that’s what it takes to get his support, that’s a recipe for general election losses.”",Reuters

Several Republicans from states that produce fossil fuels, including Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven, both of North Dakota, and Steve Daines, of Montana, joined Democrats in supporting her.Granholm wants to boost jobs in manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and wind and solar power, and is likely to play a big role in Biden’s goal to put the country on a path of decarbonizing the economy by 2050.She said during Senate hearings that critical minerals, used in batteries for EVs and to support the electric grid, in wind turbines and solar panels, can be mined responsibly in the United States.Some Republicans who voted against her, including Senator John Barrasso of top coal producing state Wyoming, said Biden’s green push would harm high paying jobs in fossil fuels.Biden “has declared war on American energy and American energy workers and I just can’t stand by as this administration tries to crush Wyoming’s economy,” Barrasso said shortly before the vote.Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal- and natural gas-producing West Virginia, said Granholm, when governor, helped save the auto industry during the Great Recession.“She brought in new investment in new industry and she created new jobs, leaving no worker behind,” said Manchin, the chairman of the Senate energy committee.The energy secretary oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and the emergency petroleum reserve, and is a member of the president’s cabinet.Once sworn in, Granholm, 62, will be the second female U.S. energy secretary after Hazel O’Leary served in the Clinton administration in the 1990s.",Reuters

The new U.S. president wants to revive the accord, but Washington and Tehran are locked in a standoff over which side should move first.The deal allows Iran to enrich uranium only with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at the underground, commercial scale Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) at Natanz. In November Iran started enriching there with a first set of IR-2m machines, which are far more efficient, and has since been adding to it.“On 7 March 2021, the Agency verified at FEP that: Iran had begun feeding natural UF6 into the third cascade of 174 IR-2m centrifuges,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report obtained by Reuters, referring to uranium hexafluoride, the form in which uranium is fed into centrifuges to purify it.“The fourth cascade of 174 IR-2m centrifuges was installed but had yet to be fed with natural UF6; installation of a fifth cascade of IR-2m centrifuges was ongoing; and installation of a sixth cascade of IR-2m centrifuges had yet to begin,” it added.In addition to its IR-1 machines, Iran is now using 522 IR-2m centrifuges to enrich uranium to up to 5% fissile purity at the FEP, the IAEA added. That is more than the 3.67% purity allowed under the deal but less than the 20% it is enriching to at another facility, Fordow. Uranium enriched to 90% purity can be used to make an atomic weapon.",Reuters

Recent protests have been much smaller, but the ruling party’s ratings in most opinion polls have slipped to around 30% from more than 40% in August.In Warsaw, several dozen protesters brandishing placards with slogans such as “I am a feminist warrior” gathered in the city centre, where they were outnumbered by a heavy police presence.Previous protests organised by the Women’s Strike movement, which opposes the tightening of restrictions regarding abortion, have been marred by violence, with the police criticised for heavy-handed tactics.“It is difficult to say anything positive about Women’s Day today. We are at war and all I can hope for is that we will win the war,” Klementyna Suchanow, co-founder of the Women’s Strike told Reuters before the demonstration began.“Women’s Day in 2021 has a specific flavour,” she said. “After the abortion regulations were tightened, this holiday takes on the significance of a battle, just like in the beginning when it was first established, over a 100 years ago.”As police formed a cordon around the protestors, speech therapist Aleksandra Gajek, 24, called it an intimidation tactic. “The number of police is intended to scare us and force us to stop fighting for our rights,” she told Reuters.The police was trying to keep traffic moving, spokesman Sylwester Marczak said by phone. “The actions of the police are determined by the blocking of traffic on one of the most important roundabouts in Warsaw.”",Reuters

MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-usa/china-says-hopes-u-s-will-remove-unreasonable-curbs-on-cooperation-idUSKBN2B029K,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China urged the United States on Sunday to remove “unreasonable” curbs on cooperation as soon as possible and work together on issues like climate change, while accusing Washington of bringing chaos in the name of spreading democracy.Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden singled out a “growing rivalry with China” as a key challenge facing the United States, with his top diplomat describing the country as “the biggest geopolitical test” of this century.Speaking at his annual news conference, the Chinese government’s top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, struck a tough line even as he outlined where the world’s two biggest economies could work together.Questioned about U.S.-China frictions over Taiwan, Xinjiang and the disputed South China Sea, Wang said Beijing “will never accept baseless accusations and smears”.The United States had used democracy and human rights as a basis for arbitrarily interfering with other countries’ affairs, he said. “The U.S. should realise this as soon as possible, otherwise the world will continue to experience instability.”The White House brushed aside the criticisms over Taiwan and said Washington would continue to support Taipei.Wang said differences between Beijing and Washington must be managed carefully, the two sides must advocate healthy competition not zero-sum finger-pointing, and that areas like climate change and fighting the pandemic were where they could cooperate.“It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and lift the various unreasonable restrictions placed on Sino-U.S. cooperation to date as soon as possible, and not create new obstacles artificially.”The United States and China are at odds over influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Beijing’s economic practices, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights in China’s Xinjiang region.The Biden administration has indicated it will broadly continue the tough approach to China taken by former President Donald Trump, but do so in coordination with allies.Wang warned there was no room for compromise on Chinese-claimed Taiwan and the new U.S. government should drop the previous administration’s “dangerous acts of playing with fire”.Biden’s team called the U.S. commitment to democratic Taiwan “rock solid” and on Monday White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a regular news briefing Washington would “continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability.”“Our position on Taiwan remains clear. We will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security and values in the Indo-Pacific region,” she said when asked about Wang’s remarks.Under Trump, the United States imposed sanctions against China and its officials over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Beijing’s economic policies, which have not been lifted by Biden.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he agrees with his predecessor Mike Pompeo’s determination that genocide against Muslims is under way in Xinjiang.Activists and U.N. experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in Chinese camps. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.Wang said some Western politicians chose to believe lies about Xinjiang, and took a dig at Western countries’ records.“When it comes to ‘genocide’, most people think of North American Indians in the 16th century, African slaves in the 19th century, Jews in the 20th century, and the Australian aborigines who are still fighting today,” he said.“The so-called ‘genocide’ in Xinjiang is ridiculously absurd. It is a rumour with ulterior motives and a complete lie.”",Reuters

Government advice against unnecessary international travel will remain in place until at least April 15, Rutte said.Bars and restaurants in the Netherlands have been closed since mid-October, along with other public places such as museums, libraries, gyms and cinemas.Last month the government allowed non-essential stores and hairdressers to reopen for a limited amount of customers by appointment.Shopkeepers, restaurant owners and anti-lockdown activists have launched several court cases to get relief from lockdown measures in recent weeks, but without success so far.Polls indicate that Rutte’s conservative VVD party will remain the largest at the elections, even though public support for his coronavirus policies has declined in recent weeks.",Reuters

In a tell-all television interview, she said someone in the royal household had raised questions about the colour of her son’s skin.Prime ministers rarely comment on royal matters. But journalists repeatedly asked Johnson about it on Monday.“I’ve always had the highest admiration for the queen and the unifying role that she plays in our country and across the Commonwealth,” he said.“As for the rest, all other matters to do with the royal family: I’ve spent a long time now not commenting on royal family matters and I don’t intend to depart from that today.”Harry and Meghan left Britain last year and have given up their royal duties to forge a new life in Los Angeles, earning media production deals. The interview with Oprah Winfrey was aired late on Sunday in the United States and was to be broadcast on Monday evening in Britain.Meghan, 39, said her son Archie, now aged one, had been denied the title of prince because there were concerns within the royal family “about how dark his skin might be when he’s born”. She and Harry both declined to say who had raised the subject. Winfrey later told CBS that Harry had said it was not Queen Elizabeth or her husband Philip.Buckingham Palace has declined to comment.The two-hour broadcast was the most anticipated royal interview since Harry’s late mother Princess Diana shared intimate details of her failed marriage to Prince Charles in 1995, denting the reputation of the heir.On Monday a YouGov poll, based on snippets of the interview and the media coverage, said 47% of people in Britain thought it was inappropriate that the couple had given the interview. A third had sympathy for them, but a third had none.Harry also used the interview to attack the press, parts of which he has despised since his mother was killed in a 1997 crash as her car sped away from chasing photographers.

Let’s get the vaccine instead, right?” Harris said in excerpts from an MSNBC interview.“We know Black people are disproportionately likely to contract the virus and die from it,” Harris said. “We know when you look at who the frontline workers are, who is the most at risk disproportionately. We are talking about people of color.”Blacks and Hispanics have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19 with a disproportionate number of deaths, and public health officials have broadly called for equity in vaccine distribution.Harris, the first Black and Asian U.S. vice president, noted that Black small businesses were also being affected, with 40% going out of business.“It is disproportionately affecting us and if we want to get control of this virus that is harming us at a disproportionate rate, part of it is to get vaccinated,” she said in the interview, to be broadcast in full on Saturday.Early data on U.S. coronavirus vaccinations suggested that Blacks and Hispanics received a smaller proportion of shots than their representation among healthcare workers and nursing home residents, two priority groups for COVID-19 inoculations.Enrollment of Black Americans in clinical trials was also a particular challenge. Mistrust runs high, in part because of the nation’s history of unethical practices in medical research on African Americans.Harris’ comments came as President Joe Biden’s administration announced the distribution of 25 million masks to vulnerable populations in community health centers and at food pantries and soup kitchens.Two-thirds of the people served by community health centers live in poverty, 60% are racial and/or ethnic minorities and nearly 1.4 million are homeless, the White House said.In outreach to Black Americans in New York on Wednesday, the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, appeared at the York College mass vaccination site with Black clergy members.Bishop Calvin Rice of the New Jerusalem Worship Center in the New York City borough of Queens said he had been vaccinated without incident.“This site is being opened specifically for our community - Every tube that’s available for vaccination, you need to come and get it,” Rice said.“We’ve seen what our communities look like fighting COVID without the vaccine and it’s painful,” he added. “I believe the vaccine is safe.

He had previously said that he was undecided on her bid.“While we do not agree on every issue, (Haaland) reaffirmed her strong commitment to bipartisanship, addressing the diverse needs of our country and maintaining our nation’s energy independence,” Manchin said in a statement. “For all these reasons, I believe Deb Haaland will be a Secretary of the Interior for every American and will vote to confirm her.”Haaland’s Senate confirmation hearing this week was contentious, with Republicans focusing on her past opposition to fossil fuel projects, as well as her likely role as a key player in President Joe Biden’s efforts to combat climate change.The U.S. Interior Department oversees around a fifth of the nation’s land surface along with offshore waters, accounting for around 25% of domestic oil and gas production. Biden has paused new drilling leasing on federal lands, and has said he wants to eventually impose a permanent ban on new drilling and encourage broader development of renewables instead.As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Manchin oversaw the two-day hearing this week. During the hearing, Manchin said he supported reducing methane emissions from pipelines on federal lands and the administration’s review of the oil and gas leasing program.Last week, Manchin said he would oppose Biden Office of Management and Budget pick Neera Tanden, putting her confirmation at risk.",Reuters

The police killing of Black man George Floyd in May after years of such deaths sparked nationwide and global protests that highlighted systemic bias in many American institutions.“The State Department has the honor of representing the American people to the world. To do that well, we must recruit and retain a workforce that truly reflects America,” Blinken said.The move reflects a sea change from the administration of former President Donald Trump, who directed federal agencies last year to end programs deemed divisive by the White House. The State Department suspended all training programs for employees related to diversity and inclusion.During Biden’s first days in office, the State Department resumed that training, and he promised more action to heal the country’s racial divide.Deputy assistant secretaries from State Department bureaus will serve on a new leadership council, and the department will soon release a diversity and inclusion strategic plan, Blinken said.The new diversity officer will advance policies in this area and “hold senior leadership accountable on progress. Our goal is to incorporate diversity and inclusion into the Department’s work at every level,” Blinken said in a statement.With 76,000 employees globally, racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented at the department, particularly in senior ranks, according to an independent federal watchdog report released last year.",Reuters

Prayuth’s government rejects that.Protesters also say the constitution gives the king too much power and demand that some of it be curbed.

Humans have degraded or destroyed roughly two-thirds of the world's original tropical rainforest cover, new data reveals – raising alarm that a key natural buffer against climate change is quickly vanishing.

The total lost between just 2002 and 2019 was larger than the area of France, he found.The rate of loss in 2019 roughly matched the annual level of destruction over the last 20 years, with a football field’s worth of forest vanishing every 6 seconds, according to another recent report by the World Resources Institute.The Brazilian Amazon has been under intense pressure in recent decades, as an agricultural boom has driven farmers and land speculators to torch plots of land for soybeans, beef and other crops. That trend has worsened since 2019, when right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took office and began weakening environmental enforcement.But the Amazon also represents the best hope for preserving what rainforest remains. The Amazon and its neighbors – the Orinoco and the Andean rainforest – account for 73.5% of tropical forests still intact, according to Krogh.The new report “reinforces that Brazil must take care of the forest,” said Ane Alencar, a geographer with the Amazon Environmental Research Institute who was not involved in the work. “Brazil has the biggest chunk of tropical forest in the world and is also losing the most.”Southeast Asian islands, mostly belonging to Indonesia, collectively rank second in terms of forest destruction since 2002, with much of those forests cleared for palm oil plantations.Central Africa ranks third, with most of the destruction centered around the Congo River basin, due to traditional and commercial farming as well as logging.Forests that were defined in the report as degraded had either been partially destroyed, or destroyed and since replaced by secondary forest growth, Rainforest Foundation Norway said.That report’s definition for intact forest may be overly strict, cautioned Tasso Azevedo, coordinator of the Brazilian deforestation mapping initiative MapBiomas. The analysis only counts untouched regions of at least 500 square km (193 square miles) as intact, leaving out smaller areas that may add to the world’s virgin forest cover, he said.Krogh explained that this definition was chosen because smaller tracts are at risk of the “edge effect,” where trees die faster and biodiversity is harder to maintain near the edge of the forest. A forest spanning 500 square km can fully sustain its ecosystem, he said.",Reuters

Women did not have a role in society then, unlike today,” it said. “It was men who took the decisions and obviously they chose” men’s names.Seven bus and tram stations will be renamed after women this year, and 10 more in 2022 and 2023, but changes to metro station names will need approval from the regional transport ministry.",Reuters

He needed a simple majority in the Democratic-controlled chamber to be confirmed.As secretary of the sprawling department, Vilsack will oversee about 100,000 employees responsible for food stamps, crop insurance, land conservation and other missions at a time U.S. farmers are benefiting from high soybean and corn prices but hunger is on the rise throughout America.Vilsack has said the White House wants to tap a pool of funds from the agency’s Commodity Credit Corporation to support on-the-farm efforts to fight climate change, a policy priority for new President Joe Biden.The Depression-era program of up to $30 billion in annual funding was tapped by the Trump administration to distribute billions of dollars in aid to cover farmers’ lost sales due to trade wars, primarily with China.Vilsack must also confront the coronavirus pandemic, which has reduced restaurant demand for farm products and led to long lines at food banks.“We have a lot of work to do as we overcome obstacles created by the COVID-19 pandemic,” American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said in a statement after the vote.Some slaughterhouses shut temporarily in spring 2020 due to outbreaks of the coronavirus among workers, pushing up meat prices and leading to shortages of certain products.“We found that when one or two processing facilities shut down during COVID, it created havoc in the market,” Vilsack said during a Senate committee hearing on Feb. 2. “We can’t have that.”Groups like the National Black Farmers Association raised concerns about Vilsack’s nomination, saying alleged discriminatory practices continued at USDA under his previous leadership.Vilsack, who was Iowa governor from 1999 to 2007, said at the Feb. 2 hearing that there can be no tolerance for discrimination.",Reuters

Thomas-Greenfield and her supporters pushed back, citing her decades as a diplomat seeking to increase U.S. influence and counteract China’s.At her confirmation hearing in late January, she stressed the importance of U.S. re-engagement with the 193-member United Nations in order to challenge efforts by China to “drive an authoritarian agenda.”China has been working to gain greater global influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership, often by providing loans to developing nations in Africa and elsewhere that tie them closer to the Beijing government.“Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield has a long history of expressed opposition to China’s use of debt trap tactics and its increasingly malign presence in world governance bodies,” Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said as he urged support.Tension between the two superpowers hit a boiling point at the United Nations last year over the coronavirus pandemic, as then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, pulled the United States back from international organizations as part of his “America First” foreign policy agenda.Biden, a Democrat, has stressed his support for multilateralism in foreign policy, not just by picking a veteran diplomat for the U.N. post, but restoring it to a Cabinet role.",Reuters

These include a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal acreage, currently the source of around a quarter of U.S. production.Republicans have been battling Biden’s sweeping plan to combat global warming and expand renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. But most Democrats on the panel applauded Biden’s focus on climate, a U-turn from former President Donald Trump’s policy. Trump emphasized oil, gas and coal production on federal lands over the fight against climate change.Republicans on the Senate energy committee pressed Haaland on Biden’s pause on new federal drilling leases. They also challenged her past statements against oil and gas production and her presence at the protest against the Dakota Access pipeline led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy asked Haaland if she had a prejudice against fossil fuels.“Prejudice on fossil fuels perhaps isn’t the way I would describe it,” Haaland said. “I would say that President Biden is ... moving toward the tremendous opportunities we have in diversifying our energy.”Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo tribal citizen, said her own economic struggles as a single mother who relied on food stamps made her well attuned to the job and economic security concerns raised by senators from energy producing states. Republicans and some Democrats from those states are concerned that drilling restrictions or other measures to curtail fossil fuels development would cost them jobs and revenues.She assured her critics that she recognizes that “fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in America” and that revenues fund critical services in states.New Mexico Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich, who introduced Haaland, said she has a track record of working across the aisle.He called her “a true partner for states like ours as we diversify our economy, invest in our communities and remain a global leader in producing and exporting energy.”She noted that the administration’s temporary pause on new leasing does not apply to drilling and other operations by existing lease holders.Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski called Haaland’s nomination “very significant” but raised concerns about the impact of Biden’s executive orders on her state’s resource-based economy. She said Interior has an “outsized” influence over Alaska, 60% of which is owned by the federal government.Alaska Republican Congressman Don Young, who joined Heinrich in introducing Haaland, said despite their disagreements over “carbon fuels” she is able to listen and work across the aisle. He urged the Senate to vote for her because “she will do a good job. She will work for us.”Haaland pointed to the historic nature of her appointment both at the Interior Department and in American history.“If an Indigenous woman from humble beginnings can be confirmed as Secretary of the Interior, our country holds promise for everyone,” she said.",Reuters

Every life counts,” he added.Since taking charge of the country at the head of a broad government of national unity, Draghi has looked to speed up vaccinations and has put pressure on pharmaceutical companies to honour their contracts and make up supply shortfalls.Italy, which has a population of around 60 million, had administered 5.41 doses of vaccines as of early Monday, with 1.65 million people receiving the recommended two shots.Draghi has suggested that first jabs should take precedence rather than stockpiling supplies for eventual second doses.",Reuters

He added that “84 years do not come without baggage” and that he could not say if he would make fewer trips in the future.While mask and social distancing regulations were respected at some indoor papal gatherings, where participation was limited, thousands of mostly young people attended a Mass at Erbil stadium on Sunday night and most were not abiding by the rules.The pope has often urged people to respect guidelines of local authorities and the Vatican said before the trip they were confident that Iraqi officials would be able to make people follow the rules.A reporter asked if he worried that people who came to see him could get sick and possibly even die.“Trips cook slowly over time in my conscience. And this (the virus threat) is one of the things that most made me think ‘perhaps, perhaps’,” Francis said.“I thought about it a lot, I prayed a lot over this. And in the end I took the decision freely. It came from within and I said ‘the one who allows me to decide this way will look after the people’,” he said, apparently referring to God.“That is how I made the decision, after prayer and after awareness of the risks,” he said.“GREAT SAGE”One of the most significant moments of the trip was the pope’s meeting on Saturday in the holy city of Najaf with the 90-year-old Sistani, one of the most influential figures inShi’ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond.“Sometimes you just have to take a risk,” he said of the meeting.“There are some critics who say that the pope is not courageous, but reckless, that he is doing things against Catholic doctrine that are one step away from heresy,” he said.Throughout his papacy, conservatives have criticised his opening to the Muslim world, including the signing in 2019 of a joint document on inter-religious fraternity during a visit to Abu Dhabi. That visit was the first by a pope to the Arabian peninsula, home of Islam’s most sacred sites.“These are risks but these decision are always taken in prayer,” he said, adding that he found Sistani to be “a great sage, a man of God”, and that the meeting “did my soul good”.On Sunday morning in Mosul, Francis heard Muslim and Christian residents in the ruined city tell of their lives under Islamic State, which occupied it from 2014 to 2017.He told reporters the visit to Mosul, where he sat surrounded by the wreckage of buildings, dangling concrete staircases, and cratered ancient churches, had left him shocked by the “unbelievable cruelty” that took place.Francis said he badly wanted to make a visit to Lebanon as soon as possible to show solidarity with the people of all religions suffering there.(This story has been refiled to add dropped word “than” in paragraph 3)",Reuters

It has urged people to wear face masks, take sanitary measures and avoid crowded areas.Officials and businessmen say the sanctions-hit government can ill afford a full lockdown given the dire state of the economy and growing poverty.After a decade of war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and uprooted millions, Assad’s military has reclaimed most of the country with Russia and Iran’s help.",Reuters

232,Nominee Garland says politics won't influence DOJ criminal probes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-senate-justice-garland/nominee-garland-says-politics-wont-influence-doj-criminal-probes-idUSKBN2AM13H,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, vowed on Monday to protect the integrity of the Justice Department from partisan influence, in an effort to restore confidence after President Donald Trump repeatedly sought to bend the department to his will.Trump, a Republican who lost to Biden in November, for years attacked Justice Department investigations of his 2016 campaign and Russian election interference as a “witch hunt” or a “hoax.”Garland, in his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, also vowed to make the investigation of the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol a top priority.The next attorney general will inherit a few investigations that began during the Trump administration of the origin of those probes and also of Hunter Biden, the new president’s son.“I would not have taken this job if I had thought politics would have any influence over prosecutions or investigations,” Garland told the panel.“The president has promised that those decisions will only be made by the attorney general, and that is what I plan to do. I do not plan to be interfered with by anyone. I expect the Justice Department will make its own decisions in this regard.”Garland’s promises marked a contrast from previous Attorney General William Barr, who was criticized for his willingness to intervene in criminal cases in ways that benefited Trump’s political allies, from Michael Flynn to Roger Stone.Garland pledged to sit down with department staff, who have suffered from low morale for the past four years amid partisan attacks and accusations by Trump they were part of a “deep state.”“I want to make clear to the career prosecutors...that my job is to protect them from partisan or other improper motives,” Garland said, adding that for now his visits with them will need to be over Zoom due to the pandemic.Garland, a federal appellate judge and former prosecutor, is widely expected to be confirmed as the nation’s top U.S. law enforcement official.He was nominated to lead a Justice Department in the midst of intensive investigations into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters - an incident Garland called “heinous.”Some of the more than 200 people arrested in the siege were associated with groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, underscoring rising concern about future violence from right-wing extremists.Garland has experience in tackling such threats, having managed the sprawling investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by anti-government extremists and supervising the prosecution of the so-called Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski after a deadly bombing spree.Garland told the committee he fears the Jan.6 riots were “not necessarily a one-off” and vowed to devote resources to the probe.“We must do everything in the power of the Justice Department to prevent this kind of interference with policies of American democratic institutions,” Garland said.Garland’s pledge to maintain the independence of Justice Department investigations will also encompass ongoing cases that may cast members of Biden’s family or former Obama officials in an unfavorable light.Amid questioning by Republicans, Garland said he had not discussed the Justice Department’s investigation into Hunter Biden’s taxes with the White House.Biden has made clear that decisions about investigations and prosecutions will be left to the Justice Department, Garland told lawmakers. “So the answer to your question is no.”He told Republicans he expects to allow John Durham, who was appointed by Barr to investigate the origins of the investigation into Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, to continue his work.“I understand that he has been permitted to remain in his position and sitting here today I have no reason to think that that was not the correct decision,” Garland said.Apart from the Justice Department’s focus on combating domestic terrorism, Garland said he intends to prioritize enforcing the civil rights laws, an area advocates say was decimated during the Trump administration.The Justice Department has faced pressure to take steps to hold police departments accountable for civil rights violations, after a white police officer killed African American George Floyd last year in Minneapolis.The killing sparked nationwide protests, but those did little to motivate the Justice Department to open probes into systemic police misconduct or other civil rights violations.Unlike Barr, who told Congress last year he did not believe systemic racism plagued the criminal justice system, Garland was unequivocal on whether the system treats Americans equally.“Sadly, and it’s plain to me, that it’s not, that it does not,” Garland told Democratic Senator Cory Booker.Garland said he would resume using court-ordered consent decrees to hold police departments accountable, a tool largely abandoned during the Trump administration.He also told Congress his support for the death penalty has eroded amid concerns it disproportionately affects Black Americans and other communities of color and that too many are wrongfully convicted.Garland stopped short of saying he will advocate for commuting all federal death sentences, but he did embrace Biden’s support for eliminating mandatory minimum sentences as part of criminal justice reform.",Reuters

Here are some quotes from the hearingGarland told Congress he used to support the death penalty, including the execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, a case he prosecuted. He said his views have evolved due to concerns about executing innocent people and its disparate impact on communities of color.“I have had a great pause about the death penalty. I am very concerned about the large number of exonerations that have occurred through DNA evidence and otherwise,” he said.“The data is clear that it has an enormously disparate impact on Black Americans and members of communities of color.”Garland revealed he will not seek to prioritize marijuana possession prosecutions.“We can focus our attention on violent crimes and other crimes that put great danger in our society, and not allocate our resources to some things like marijuana possession.”“We should do as, as President Biden has suggested, seek the elimination of mandatory minimum. So that we once again give authority to district judges and trial judges to make determinations based on all of the sentencing factors that judges normally apply.”“We don’t have to seek highest possible offense with the highest possible sentence. ... Legislatively, we should look at equalizing ... what’s known as the crack powder ratio, which has had an enormously disproportionate impact on communities of color.”‘DEFUNDING THE POLICE’“President Biden has said he does not support defunding the police, and neither do I.”“I do really and President Biden believes in giving resources to police departments to help them reform and gain the trust of their communities.”“I think police accountability is an essential element of the ability of a police department to have credibility with the community.”“Congress has given the Justice Department the authority and the responsibility to investigate patterns or practices of law enforcement and...conduct that violate the Constitution and laws of the United States... It is an important tool the department has for ensuring accountability.”Garland said he supports the use consent decrees as needed to hold police departments accountable.“Where they are necessary to ensure accountability, it’s very important that we use that tool.”ON CRACKING DOWN ON THE PROLIFERATION OF CHEMICAL LOOK-ALIKES OF FENTANYL:“To be honest, I’m not no chemist (sic). This is one of the reasons I ended up being a lawyer, instead of a doctor. But I would need to look at what would be proposed. But I do understand the scope of this problem, and I’m in favor of doing something, either by scheduling, or legislation, if I’m confirmed, that would address the problem that you’re talking about, which is an enormous problem for enforcement.”",Reuters

The European Union is preparing to widen its sanctions on Myanmar's armed forces to target businesses they run, in protest at the Feb. 1 military coup, according to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-eu/exclusive-eu-preparing-sanctions-on-myanmar-military-businesses-documents-show-idUSKBN2B01D1,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is preparing to widen its sanctions on Myanmar’s armed forces to target businesses they run, in protest at the Feb. 1 military coup, according to diplomats and two internal documents seen by Reuters.The measures, which diplomats said could be agreed by EU foreign ministers on March 22, would target companies “generating revenue for, or providing financial support to, the Myanmar Armed Forces”, said one of the documents dated March 5.While the bloc has an arms embargo on Myanmar, and has targeted some senior military officials since 2018, the measures would be its most significant response so far since the coup.EU diplomats told Reuters that parts of the military’s conglomerates, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), were likely to be targeted, barring EU investors and banks from doing business with them.The conglomerates are spread throughout the economy from mining and manufacturing to food and beverages to hotels, telecoms and banking. They rank among the country’s biggest taxpayers and sought partnerships with foreign companies as Myanmar opened up during the democratic liberalization.A U.N. fact-finding mission in 2019 recommended sanctions against the two companies and their subsidiaries, saying they gave the army extra sources of revenue that could finance human rights violations.A Myanmar junta spokesman did not answer a call seeking comment on the EU’s plan to broaden its sanctions.Last week, the EU said it was suspending development funds to Myanmar, although it has so far declined to freeze trade preferences to one of Asia’s poorest countries for fear of hitting mainly female workers in the textile sector.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Thursday said fresh sanctions were part of the EU’s plans for economic punishment in response to the coup.“With these measures, we are aiming very deliberately at the decision-makers in the military. Further options, such as the listing of economic companies of the military, are already on the table and can be taken shortly,” Maas told the German parliament.Like much of the West, the EU condemned the coup last month that unseated the government of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and EU foreign ministers called for her release and the restoration of civilian rule.However, such calls have been ignored, and police and military have killed more than 50 people to quell daily demonstrations and strikes against the coup, according to the United Nations last week.The EU’s expected new sanctions, which are under preparation this week, follow a U.S. decision last month to target the military and their business interests.Additionally, the bloc is set to place asset freezes and travel bans on military officials and border guard police accused of the crackdown on protesters against the coup, the EU documents seen by Reuters showed, although names are still under discussion.Suu Kyi’s party won a 2015 election but the transition to democracy was brought to a halt by the coup that ousted her government as it was preparing to begin its second term after her National League for Democracy (NLD) swept a Nov. 8 election.The military cited election fraud as justification for its takeover. The electoral commission dismissed accusations of fraud.",Reuters

One person brings rice, one brings pasta,” said Abdelsalam.The couple, who were working as a journalist and a lawyer, left Sudan because of political pressures and came to Egypt with their three children in 2017 hoping to find some security and stability.Abdelsalam, 36, and Ibrahim, 44, found a niche teaching the children of other Sudanese migrants, setting up the Future Generation Center for Education charity shortly after they arrived.Though the economic downturn caused by the pandemic has not been as severe in Egypt as in some other countries, many migrants and refugees have lost their jobs.“There’s no work, and I can’t find any help from anyone except this centre,” said Zakaria Issa, who came to Egypt from fleeing war in Sudan’s Darfur region.Last year, U.N. migration agency IOM estimated that a fifth of an estimated 6.3 million foreigners in Egypt were in need of assistance. More than 300,000 are registered refugees and asylum seekers, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR.A few days a week the centre prepares meals with meat and vegetables to distribute to up to 400 families from Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Yemen, as well as some Egyptian families.The centre, which has 15 staff members and is based in Giza, across the Nile from central Cairo, has served 14,000 meals over the past 10 months.It is supported by‮ ‬charitable donations and local Egyptian NGOs, she said, including Mastoora, founded by Shurooq Mustafa.“These are people looking for better circumstances in this pandemic,” said Mustafa. “We wanted to be a refuge so that they feel they aren’t alone.”",Reuters

That is a sign of our basic freedoms,” Walter Wobmann, chairman of the referendum committee and a member of parliament for the Swiss People’s Party, had said before the vote.Facial covering is “a symbol for this extreme, political Islam which has become increasingly prominent in Europe and which has no place in Switzerland,” he said.Muslim groups condemned the vote and said they would challenge it.“Today’s decision opens old wounds, further expands the principle of legal inequality, and sends a clear signal of exclusion to the Muslim minority,” the Central Council of Muslims in Switzerland said.It promised legal challenges to laws implementing the ban and a fundraising drive to help women who are fined.“Anchoring dress codes in the constitution is not a liberation struggle for women but a step back into the past,” the Federation of Islamic Organisations in Switzerland said, adding Swiss values of neutrality, tolerance and peacemaking had suffered in the debate.France banned wearing a full face veil in public in 2011 and Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and Bulgaria have full or partial bans on wearing face coverings in public.Two Swiss cantons already have local bans on face coverings, although almost no one in Switzerland wears a burqa and only around 30 women wear the niqab, the University of Lucerne estimates.

Instead they asked the tribunal’s own Trust Fund to help set up and finance vocational and other programmes to support victims of his crimes.Ntaganda was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2019 for murder, rape and other atrocities committed when he was military chief of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) militia in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002-2003.Hundreds of civilians were killed and many thousands forced to flee during the fighting.“The chamber hereby unanimously issues an order for reparations against mister Ntaganda (and) assesses mister Ntaganda’s liability for these reparations at 30 million US dollars,” judge Chang-ho Chung said.As Ntaganda could not pay, “the Chamber encourages the Trust Fund for Victims to complement the reparation awards to the extent possible and engage in additional fundraising efforts as necessary to complement the totality of the award,” he added.In 2020 the fund, which relies on voluntary contributions, had around 18 million euros in reserves and much of that was already pledged in other cases.Victims eligible for the reparations programme include victims of attacks led by Ntaganda, child soldiers under his command, rape victims and children born out of rape.The judges awarded collective reparations, meaning there will be no individual pay outs. Any money will instead go to charities or funds set up to help victims.Ntaganda is appealing against his conviction.",Reuters

After a year that has shaken Britain's National Health Service to its core, women working at hospitals in the East Lancashire NHS Trust in England's north-west talk about what the coronavirus crisis has meant to them.

I wanted to say and scream at the top of my voice ‘no don’t, I don’t want her to go’.”For paramedic Maxine Sharples, 36, a solid barrier between her home life and her work with the North West Ambulance service was an essential coping mechanism, following shift after shift transporting patients who would never return to their families.“As soon as I get home, I shut the door and I’m back to being a mum and a wife, and I just have to play that role until I go back to work again,” she said.“I think a lot of people in the NHS have that ability to just switch off. I don’t think you’re born with it. You just learn it and maybe it makes you a little bit hard, as well, but you kind of have to.”Consultant and clinical director in emergency medicine Dr Georgina Robertson said her year “leading the shop floor” at the East Lancashire Hospitals Trust had been the most difficult of her career.“The numbers have been the highest, the patients have been the sickest, and, alongside that, we’ve had to struggle with staff shortages at levels that we’ve never seen before,” the 46-year-old said.“So that’s been very difficult, and then obviously at home it’s been very difficult. I’ve got three children,” she said, pausing to compose herself. “I’ve got three children who’ve been off school for a long time and have missed out on things.”Reflecting on the past 12 months, Robertson said she would not usually allow herself to become emotional, particularly in front of the staff she leads.“But we’re all human and it’s been a really difficult time, so sometimes to see that human side helps your team as well so they know it’s not just them that’s been affected,” she said.“They’re amazing, they just keep going every day despite what’s thrown at them.”Critical care nurse Jacqui Jocelyn, 53, has worked in nursing for 30 years. Twenty of those have been spent on the intensive care unit at the East Lancashire hospital.After spending the year being with patients at the end of their lives, while their families were not permitted to do so, Jocelyn’s father was admitted to the same ward.“He was on the unit for three weeks, actually. He fought a good fight. He was a great character,” she said.“All the staff were amazing with him. I don’t think it was just because it was my dad. But they went out their way to make him feel special and try and get better, but, unfortunately, he fought a losing battle and died.”Jocelyn’s daughter, 19-year-old Ruby Jocelyn, was inspired by her mother during the pandemic and decided to take up nursing instead of a degree in business and economics. The care of her grandfather by ICU staff inspired her to pursue critical care, following her mother.“When I started in December it was so, so busy,” Ruby said. “The age was dropping and there were people my mum and dad’s age on there, and their kids are obviously the same age as me, and I just couldn’t believe it and that made me want to help instead of running away.”Speaking about her mother, Ruby described Jacqui as a “tough nut”, but the pandemic had taken its toll.“I think the pandemic didn’t necessarily break her, but it did take a layer of braveness off her,” she said.“And I think experiencing it first hand, as well, as a daughter of a patient, and not being able to see her dad or look after him as she wanted, I think she did struggle then but it also gave her a bit of like courage as well.”",Reuters

MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-thailand/thailand-to-reduce-quarantine-period-for-vaccinated-travellers-idUSKBN2B00VB,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand will from next month reduce its mandatory quarantine from 14 to seven days for foreigners arriving in the country who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, its Health Minister said on Monday.Vaccinations must be administered within three months of the travel period and visitors will still be required to show negative COVID-19 test results within three days of their departure, Anutin Charnvirankul told a news conference.Those not yet inoculated but with coronavirus-free certificates would be quarantined for 10 days, he said.“Foreigners travelling to Thailand with vaccination certificates in accordance with the requirements of each brands, will need to quarantine for only seven days,” Anutin said, referring to the doses needed to be effective.Thailand’s flight limits, its strict entry requirements and mandatory quarantine for all arrivals have been central to its success in limiting the spread of the virus to just over 26,000 cases and 85 deaths.Those curbs have decimated its vital tourism sector, however, prompting widespread jobs losses and business closures and contributing to the country’s deepest economic traction in over two decades.The country received close to 40 million visitors in 2019.The new measures do not apply to those travelling from Africa, who would still be subject to quarantine for two weeks due to concerns about other variants of the virus.Vaccinated Thai nationals without a certificate showing they are coronavirus-free need to spend one week in quarantine after two negative tests in the country.After October, if Thailand inoculates 70% of medical personnel and at-risk groups, there could be more easing of restriction, Anutin said, adding it was possible quarantine could be waived completely.Thailand has so far vaccinated 27,497 people, mostly medical workers, using the Sinovac Biotech vaccine. It has ordered 61 million doses in total of the AstraZeneca vaccine with mass vaccinations slated to begin in JuneAnutin said the country may need to order an additional 10 to 20 million doses, which it could source from other producers.",Reuters

Yemen's Houthi forces fired drones and missiles at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry on Sunday, including a Saudi Aramco facility at Ras Tanura vital to petroleum exports, in what Riyadh called a failed assault on global energy security.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-saudi/yemens-houthis-attack-saudi-oil-heartland-with-drones-missiles-idUSKBN2AZ03F,"SANAA (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi forces fired drones and missiles at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry on Sunday, including a Saudi Aramco facility at Ras Tanura vital to petroleum exports, in what Riyadh called a failed assault on global energy security.The Saudi energy ministry said there were no casualties or loss of property from the attacks. The defence ministry said it intercepted an armed drone coming from the sea prior to hitting its target at an oil storage yard at Ras Tanura, site of a refinery and the world’s biggest offshore oil loading facility.Shrapnel from a ballistic missile fell near a residential compound in Dhahran used by state-controlled Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, the ministries said.The attacks drove Brent crude prices above $70 a barrel to their highest since January 2020, while U.S. crude futures touched their loftiest since October 2018. [O/R]The sites are located on the Gulf coast across from Iran and near Iraq and Bahrain, which is home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet. Yemen lies thousands of kms southwest on the Gulf of Aden.Announcing the attacks, the Houthis, who have been battling a Saudi-led coalition for six years, also said they attacked military targets in the Saudi cities of Dammam, Asir and Jazan.“Such acts of sabotage do not only target the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but also the security and stability of energy supplies to the world, and therefore, the global economy,” a ministry spokesman said in a statement on state media.The Saudi-led coalition earlier said it intercepted 12 armed drones aimed at “civilian targets” without specifying a location as well as two ballistic missiles fired towards Jazan.The Eastern Province is home to most of Aramco’s production and export facilities. In 2019, Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, was shaken by a big missile and drone attack on oil installations just a few km (miles) from the facilities hit on Sunday, which Riyadh blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.That attack, which was claimed by the Houthis but which Riyadh said did not originate from Yemen, forced Saudi Arabia to temporarily shut more than half of its crude output, causing a huge price spike.Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said on Sunday that the group had fired 14 drones and eight ballistic missiles in a “wide operation in the heart of Saudi Arabia”.The Houthis recently stepped up cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia at a time when the United States and the United Nations are pushing for a ceasefire to revive stalled political negotiations to end the war.Last Thursday, the movement said it fired a missile at an Aramco petroleum products distribution plant in the Red Sea city of Jeddah which the Houthis had attacked in November 2020, hitting a storage tank. Aramco and Saudi authorities have not commented about Thursday’s claim.The military alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Colonel Turki al-Malki, the spokesman of the Saudi defence ministry and of the Saudi-led military coalition, said in a statement that the ministry would take “all necessary, deterrent measures to safeguard its national assets”.Earlier, the coalition said it conducted air strikes on Houthi military targets in Sanaa and other Yemeni regions on Sunday and warned that “civilians and civilian objects in the Kingdom are a red line”.It said the Houthis had been emboldened after the new U.S. administration revoked terrorist designations on the group in February that had been imposed by former President Donald Trump’s administration and backed by Riyadh.Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Houthi military leaders in the first punitive measures against the group by President Joe Biden’s administration following the increase in attacks on Saudi cities and intensified battles in Yemen’s Marib region.In February, Biden declared a halt to U.S. support for offensive operations by the coalition but said the United States would continue to help Saudi Arabia defend itself.The war, which has been in a military stalemate for years, has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed Yemen to the brink of famine. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and foreign aggression.",Reuters
244,"U.S. Supreme Court formally pulls the plug on election-related cases
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought a formal end to eight lingering disputes pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the Nov. 3 presidential election including a Republican challenge to the extension of Pennsylvania's deadline to receive mail-in ballots.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election/u-s-supreme-court-formally-pulls-the-plug-on-election-related-cases-idUSKBN2AM1S1,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought a formal end to eight lingering disputes pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the Nov. 3 presidential election including a Republican challenge to the extension of Pennsylvania’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots.The justices turned away appeals by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and Republican members of the state legislature of a ruling by Pennsylvania’s top court ordering officials to count mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and received up to three days later.Three of the nine-member court’s six conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - dissented from the decision not to hear the Pennsylvania case.Trump, a Republican, lost his re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden, who took office on Jan. 20. Biden defeated Trump by more than 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania and the legal case focused on fewer than 10,000 ballots.The high court, as expected, also rejected two Trump appeals challenging Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin based on claims that the rules for mail-in ballots in the two election battleground states were invalid. The court also turned away separate cases brought by Trump allies in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Arizona - all states won by Biden.It already was clear that the high court had no intention to intervene in the cases because it did not act before Congress on Jan. 6 certified Biden’s victory. That formal certification was interrupted when a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. The court also turned down motions to expedite the election cases.Trump made false claims that the presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and irregularities.The case brought by Pennsylvania Republicans concerned 9,428 ballots out of 6.9 million cast in the state. The Supreme Court previously rejected a Republican request to block the lower court ruling allowing the ballots to be counted.In his dissent, Thomas said the Supreme Court should resolve whether non-legislators, including elections officials and courts, have any power to set election rules. Thomas said it was fortunate that the state high court’s ruling did not involve enough ballots to affect the election’s outcome.“But we may not be so lucky in the future,” Thomas wrote.The election dispute in Pennsylvania, like in several other states, involved changes implemented to facilitate voting during the coronavirus pandemic, a public health crisis that prompted a surge in mail-in ballots as voters sought to avoid crowded polling places.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court sided with the state’s Democratic Party and various Democratic officials and candidates who argued that an Election Day mail-in ballot receipt deadline would violate the state constitution’s guarantee of “free and equal” elections given the pandemic and warnings by the U.S. Postal Service over its ability to deliver ballots in time.The state Republican Party intervened in the case to oppose the deadline extension. It argued that the state court usurped the Republican-controlled legislature’s authority in ordering the extension.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, told the justices in a filing that particularly given Trump’s repeated attempts to overturn the election result based on unfounded claims of voting fraud, “the court should not plunge itself into the political thicket by granting a case that will not affect the outcome of any election.”",Reuters

He resigned from the position in 1948 but remained a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors - the only modern Fed chief to do so - until 1951.Thomas McCabe, 1948-1951McCabe was appointed by Democrat Harry Truman. He resigned as Fed chief in 1951.William McChesney Martin Jr., 1951-1970Martin, the longest-serving Fed chief, was first appointed by Truman. He was reappointed four times by three subsequent presidents, twice by Republican Dwight Eisenhower and once each by Democrats John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. Ineligible for a sixth term, he resigned in 1970.Arthur Burns, 1970-1978Burns was the first head of the modern Fed not to leave by his own choice. He was first appointed by Republican Richard Nixon, who reappointed him once. Democrat Jimmy Carter chose not to reappoint him, becoming the first president not to reappoint a Fed chief he inherited from his predecessor.G. William Miller, 1978-1979Miller, appointed by Carter, served only 17 months as head of the Fed before leaving to become Carter’s Treasury secretary. He had the shortest tenure of any modern Fed chief.Paul Volcker, 1979-1987Volcker, famous as the Fed chair who triumphed over the rampant inflation that was deeply entrenched in the U.S. economy during the 1970s and early 1980s, was appointed by Carter. He was reappointed once by Republican Ronald Reagan, but he did not seek a third term, resigning in 1987.Alan Greenspan, 1987-2006Greenspan served under four presidents and was first appointed by Reagan. He was reappointed once by Republican George H.W. Bush, twice by Democrat Bill Clinton and to his final term by Republican George W. Bush. Ineligible for a sixth term, he left the Fed in January 2006.Ben Bernanke, 2006-2014Bernanke, who crafted the Fed’s response to the 2007-2009 recession and financial crisis and established a game plan still largely in use today, was appointed by George W. Bush and reappointed once by Democrat Barack Obama. He declined to seek a third term and left the Fed in January 2014.Janet Yellen, 2014-2018Yellen, now U.S. Treasury secretary, was appointed by Obama. She became the first Fed chief since Burns not to be reappointed by a successor presidential administration when Republican Donald Trump opted to replace her.Jerome Powell, 2018-presentTrump appointed Powell and almost immediately came to regret it. Powell initially continued the interest rate increases that had begun under Yellen, prompting Trump to call him an “enemy” and a “bonehead.” In the year since the coronavirus pandemic began, Powell has acted aggressively to shield the economy from the effects of the outbreak and has retooled how the Fed approaches its policy mission.

246,"Analysis: Fed's Powell set table for Biden economy, but will he stay for dessert?",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-analysis/analysis-feds-powell-set-table-for-biden-economy-but-will-he-stay-for-dessert-idUSKBN2AM121,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Over the past year Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has engineered the largest economic rescue in U.S. history, thrown a controversial lifeline to companies hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and steered a sweeping labor-friendly revamp of monetary policy that any presidential administration would welcome.Is it enough to earn the 68-year-old former investment banker four more years as the head of the U.S. central bank?That question will get increased attention during this, the final year of Powell’s term, and the conversation may start as early as this week when the Fed chief delivers his semi-annual update on the economy in two hearings before Congress.The testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will be Powell’s first since President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats took control of the White House and Capitol Hill.While the body of work Powell can show Biden on monetary policy is extensive - so much so that there’d seem little reason to replace him when his term expires next February - he may face scrutiny over the Fed’s moves to relax regulations on financial institutions.Those steps were often opposed by the left flank of the Democratic Party as well as Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a 59-year-old economist who is seen as the most likely person to replace Powell if Biden decides to put out a “Help Wanted” sign.Brainard is prominent in Democratic policy circles and has played a key role in shaping Fed policy since she was appointed to the U.S. central bank in 2014 after serving in the Obama administration’s Treasury Department.Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are among the progressives who opposed Powell’s appointment as Fed chief in 2018, as did then-Senator Kamala Harris, who is now Biden’s vice president. The hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, of which Warren is a member, may provide a gauge of how deep that opposition still runs.“Is there anything else this White House could, if it was inclined to, ask of the Fed? Not much,” Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chair who is now a Princeton University professor, said of a central bank that is locked firmly into a pledge to get the economy back to full employment as fast as possible. That’s also the Biden administration’s top economic priority.“Biden is going to be quite happy with the performance of the Fed chair. The market is going to be quite happy with the performance of the Fed chair. (Treasury Secretary and former Fed chief Janet) Yellen will only have good things to say. But there will be Democrats urging him to replace Powell with a Democrat.”Politics traditionally has not been a concern when it comes to the Fed, an institution expected to stay out of Washington’s partisan battles, and one where U.S. presidents have often crossed party lines to reappoint their predecessors’ picks for the central bank’s top job. Along with guiding U.S. monetary policy, the Fed chief is perhaps the most influential official in global finance.Reappointing Powell would restore a bipartisan approach, as well as continue policies that, step by step, have been elevating issues Biden often cites, including advancing racial equity.A moderate by temperament, Powell over the past two years had the Fed delve deep into how the central bank influences the job market. In the end, policymakers not only decided they could do much more to champion the cause of attaining maximum employment - one of the central bank’s two statutory mandates - but redefined the concept as something that needed to be “broad-based and inclusive.”“Powell is fully committed to the president’s priorities of getting the economy back to full employment as fast as possible, and easing the financial stress on low-income households and disadvantaged groups,” said Moody’s Analytics economist Mark Zandi, who expects Powell to get another four-year term.Enter the politics.Powell, a Republican, past private equity executive, and native of the suburban professional class enclave of Chevy Chase, Maryland, was first appointed to the Fed's Board of Governors in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama. He has spent more time than his predecessors cultivating lawmakers here from both parties  in Congress. Those relationships could mean, for Biden, a potentially pain-free reconfirmation for a key economic policy maker in broad alignment with the president's agenda - and stability where it matters.But Powell was also the man former President Donald Trump promoted to replace Yellen, in a move that not only broke the bipartisan mold, but did so in favor of someone with arguably lesser economic credentials.At the time, Powell had hoped to become the Fed’s vice chair to oversee financial regulation, a role well-aligned with his career as a Wall Street lawyer and investor. His leap to the top job was unexpected, and he would readily acknowledge Yellen’s influence over his own understanding of the position.After a year in which the Fed itself has discussed openly its institutional weaknesses in diversity as well as past blindness to how its policies failed many workers, there may be more than a few calls for Biden to put his mark on the central bank’s leadership.Dennis Kelleher, president of the Better Markets think tank and a member of the Biden transition team on the Fed and regulatory issues, said Powell can be lauded for his handling of the current crisis but should also be held to account for the central bank’s regulatory decisions - terrain where Brainard’s dissenting votes “are a very good road map to where and how far they got the deregulation wrong.”For example, under Powell and Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, the central bank has rolled back restrictions on certain trading activities by banks and given them more advance information about their annual stress tests. A Trump appointee, Quarles’ term expires in the fall, giving Biden yet more scope to reshape the Fed.”When you add up the deregulation by the Federal Reserve under the Trump administration it amounts to a significant weakening of critical financial protection rules, and Chair Powell should be required to answer to that,” Kelleher said. “It is not the case that there are just one or two or three people who can do that job.”",Reuters

A decade ago, Sakae Kato stayed behind to rescue cats abandoned by neighbours who fled the radiation clouds belching from the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant. He won't leave.

He won’t leave.“I want to make sure I am here to take care of the last one,” he said from his home in the contaminated quarantine zone. “After that I want to die, whether that be a day or hour later.”So far he has buried 23 cats in his garden, the most recent graves disturbed by wild boars that roam the depopulated community. He is looking after 41 others in his home and another empty building on his property.Kato leaves food for feral cats in a storage shed he heats with a paraffin stove. He has also rescued a dog, Pochi. With no running water, he has to fill bottles from a nearby mountain spring, and drive to public toilets.The 57-year-old, a small construction business owner in his former life, says his decision to stay as 160,000 other people evacuated the area was spurred in part by the shock of finding dead pets in abandoned houses he helped demolish.The cats also gave him a reason to stay on land that has been owned by his family for three generations.“I don’t want to leave, I like living in these mountains,” he said standing in front of his house, which he is allowed to visit but, technically, not allowed to sleep in.The two-storey wooden structure is in poor condition.Rotten floorboards sag. It is peppered with holes where wall panels and roof tiles that kept the rain out were dislodged by a powerful earth tremor last month, stirring frightening memories of the devastating quake on March 11, 2011, that led to a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown.“It might last another two or three years. The walls have started to lean,” Kato said.Decontamination in fields near his house signal that other residents will soon be allowed to return.He estimates he spends $7,000 a month on his animals, part of it to buy dog food for wild boar that gather near his house at sunset. Farmers consider them pests, and also blame them for wrecking empty homes.On Feb. 25, Kato was arrested on suspicion of freeing wild boar caught in traps set up by Japan’s government in November. At time this article was published, he was still being detained for questioning.Yumiko Konishi, a vet from Tokyo who helps Kato, said local volunteers were caring for the cats on his property, but at least one had died since he was detained.About 30 km (19 miles) southeast, still in the restricted zone, Hisae Unuma is also surveying the state of her home, which withstood the earthquake a decade ago but is now close to collapsing after years of being battered by wind, rain and snow.“I’m surprised it’s still standing,” the 67-year-old farmer said, a week after the tremor that damaged Kato’s house.“I could see my cattle in the field from there,” she said pointing to the living room, a view now blocked by a tangle of bamboo.Unuma fled as the cooling system at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s nuclear plant 2.5 km away failed and its reactors began to melt down.The government, which has adopted Fukushima as a symbol of national revival amid preparations for Tokyo Olympic Games, is encouraging residents to return to decontaminated land.Lingering fears about the nuclear plant, jobs and poor infrastructure are keeping many away, though.Unuma, now a vegetable farmer in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, where her husband died three years ago, won’t return even if the government scrapes the radioactive soil off her fields.Radiation levels around her house are around 20 times the background level in Tokyo, according to a dosimeter reading carried out by Reuters.Only the removal of Fukushima’s radioactive cores will make her feel safe, a task that will take decades to complete.“Never mind the threat from earthquakes, those reactors could blow if someone dropped a tool in the wrong place,” she said.Before making the four-hour drive back to her new home, Unuma visits the Ranch of Hope, a cattle farm owned by Masami Yoshizawa, who defied an order to cull his irradiated livestock in protest against the government and Tokyo Electric Power.Among the 233 bullocks still there is the last surviving bullock from the 50-strong herd Unuma used to tend, and one of her last living links to the life she had before the disaster.Her bullock ignores her when she tries to lure him over, so Yoshizawa gives her a handful of cabbage to try to tempt him.“The thing about cattle, is that they really only think about food,” Yoshizawa said.",Reuters

He said he was particularly hurt that security had been denied to him and his family.“I think she (Diana) would feel very angry with how this has panned out and very sad.

All options remain on the table.”According to the letter, the United States is pursuing high-level diplomatic efforts “to move matters more fundamentally and quickly toward a settlement and a permanent and comprehensive cease-fire.”The letter said the United States would ask the United Nations to convene foreign ministers and envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran, India and United States “to discuss a unified approach to supporting peace in Afghanistan.”It added the United States will ask Turkey to host a senior-level meeting of “both sides in the coming weeks to finalize a peace agreement.”Blinken said in the event of a U.S. military withdrawal that he was concerned “the security situation will worsen and that the Taliban could make rapid territorial gains,” adding he hoped Ghani would “understand the urgency of my tone.”Peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban insurgents in Qatari capital of Doha, have largely stalled as U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration reviews how to handle the peace process, including troops withdrawal.Blinken in the letter mentioned that Washington had not concluded the review.“We are considering the full withdrawal of our forces by May 1st, as we consider other options,” he said in the letter.Violence in Afghanistan has increased recently as peace talks between the Taliban and the government has made no progress. Both sides have said they were getting ready for a “tough” spring offensive.On Saturday, Ghani said his government was ready to discuss holding fresh elections in a bit to push forward peace talks.Afghan officials and western diplomats said that during Khalilzad’s visit to Kabul he discussed the idea of an interim government after bringing Afghan leaders together for a multilateral conference outside the country.A Taliban spokesman in Doha said the group has received a proposed draft plan for the peace process and were reviewing it.Ghani has strongly opposed the idea of the interim government and said any new government should be formed through elections.",Reuters

Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan spoke to Oprah Winfrey in an interview aired on U.S. broadcaster CBS.

That was relayed to me from Harry those were conversations that family had with him.”Harry, asked about the issue: “That conversation, I’m never going to share. But at the time, it was awkward. I was a bit shocked.”“That was right at the beginning when she wasn’t going to get security, when members of my family were suggesting that she carries on acting because there’s not enough money to pay for her, and all this sort of stuff. There were some real obvious signs, before we even got married, that this was going to be really hard.”Meghan, on considering suicide:“I just didn’t want to be alive anymore. And that was a very clear and real and frightening constant thought. And I remember how he (Harry) just cradled me.”She said she went to senior people in the institution to ask for help.“I went to the institution and I said that I needed to go somewhere to get help ... And I was told that I couldn’t, that it wouldn’t be good for the institution.“I remember this conversation like it was yesterday, because they said, my heart goes out to you because I see how bad it is, but there’s nothing we can do to protect you because you’re not a paid employee of the institution.“This wasn’t a choice. This was emails and begging for help, saying very specifically I am concerned for my mental welfare.”Asked if she thinking of harming herself, or having suicidal thoughts, while pregnant with her first child she said:“Yes. This was very, very clear ... and very scary.”Harry, asked whether he told his family about his plans to step away from his royal roles and about a newspaper story that they had “blindsided” the queen with their decision:“I’ve never blindsided my grandmother, I have too much respect for her.”Asked where the story came from, he said: “I’d hazard a guess that it probably could have come from within the institution.”“I had three conversations with my grandmother, and two conversations with my father before he stopped taking my calls. And then he said, can you put this all in writing?”Asked why Prince Charles had stopped taking his calls:“By that point I took matters into my own hands, it was like, I needed to do this for my family. This is not a surprise to anybody. It’s really sad that it’s got to this point, but I’ve got to do something for my own mental health, my wife’s and for Archie’s as well.”Harry, on media behaviour echoing that his mother Princess Diana faced before her death in a Paris car crash in 1997:“My biggest concern was history repeating itself, and I’ve said that before on numerous occasions, very publicly. And what I was seeing was history repeating itself, but more perhaps more definitely far more dangerous because then you add race in, and you add social media and when I’m talking about history repeating itself I’m talking about my mother.”Harry, asked what his mother would say about his decision to step away from his royal role:“I think she would feel very angry with how this has panned out and very sad. But ultimately, all she’s ever wanted is for us to be happy.”Meghan, on a newspaper story that she made Prince William’s wife Kate cry over flower girls’ dresses before Meghan and Harry’s wedding:“The narrative with Kate, which didn’t happen, was really, really difficult and something that I think that’s when everything changed really.”Asked if she made Kate cry: “The reverse happened. A few days before the wedding she was upset about something, pertaining to ... the flower girl dresses, and it made me cry. And it really hurt my feelings.”“There wasn’t a confrontation and ... I don’t think it’s fair to her to get into the details of that because she apologised, and I forgiven her. What was hard to get over was being blamed for something that not only I didn’t do, but that happened to me.”“I’m not sharing that piece about Kate in any way to be disparaging to her.”Meghan, asked if she was silent or had been silenced:“The latter. Everyone in my world was given a very clear directive from the moment the world knew Harry and I were dating to always say no comment.”Meghan said she believed she was being protected by the royal institution.“It was only once we were married and everything started to really worsen that I came to understand that not only was I not being protected but that they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family. But they weren’t willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband.”Asked if she was not supported by the powers that be, she said: “There’s the family, and then there’s the people that are running the institution, those are two separate things and it’s important to be able to compartmentalise that because the queen, for example, has always been wonderful to me.”Harry, asked whether he would have stepped away from the royal family if it had not been for Meghan:“The answer to your question is no ... I wouldn’t have been able to, because I myself was trapped.“I was trapped but I didn’t know I was trapped. Like the rest of my family are, my father and my brother, they are trapped. They don’t get to leave and I have huge compassion for that.”“It’s a very trapping environment that a lot of them are stuck in. I didn’t have anyone to turn to.“For the family they very much have this mentality of ‘This is just how it is, this is how it’s meant to be, you can’t change it, we’ve all been through it.“What was different for me was the race element, because now it wasn’t just about her. It was about what she represented.”Meghan, on whether she expected a backlash from the palace: “I’m not going to live my life in fear.”“I don’t know how they could expect that after all of this time we would still just be silent, if there is an active role that The Firm (the royal family) is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us.”Harry, on the royal family failing to speak out about the racist articles written about Meghan:“The saddest parts I guess was over 70 members of parliament, female members of parliament, ... came out and called out the colonial undertones of articles and headlines written about Megan, yet no one from my family ever said anything over those three years.”“That hurts, but I also am acutely aware of where my family stand and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them.”Harry, asked about his relationship with elder brother Prince William:“Much will continue to be said about that ... as I said before, you know, I love William to bits, he’s my brother, we’ve been through hell together and we have a shared experience. But we’re on different paths.”“The relationship is space at the moment, and you know time heals all things, hopefully.”Meghan, on the couple’s secret wedding before their official ceremony in May 2018: “You know, three days before our wedding, we got married - no-one knows that.”“Just the two of us in our backyard with the Archbishop of Canterbury.”Harry, asked if Meghan had in some way saved him from a trapped royal life:“Without question, there was other forces at play, I think throughout this whole process. So, yeah, she did without question, she saved (me).”Meghan, on allegations she had manipulated the whole situation:“Can you imagine how little sense that makes? I left my career, my life, I left everything because I love him, and our plan was to do this forever.”Meghan, about her wedding day:“It was like having an out-of-body experience ... I think we were both really aware, even in advance of that, this wasn’t our day, this was the day that was planned for the world.”Meghan, on marrying into the royal family:“I will say I went into it naively because I didn’t grow up knowing much about the royal family. I didn’t fully understand what the job was.”",Reuters

Australia launched a A$19 million campaign on International Women's Day urging people to ""unmute"" or speak up when they witness disrespect against women, as its parliament is under scrutiny over sexual assault allegations.

One of the alleged victims has lodged a complaint with police.Last week, Attorney-General Christian Porter, the country’s chief law officer, identified himself as the subject of a separate historical rape allegation, declared his innocence and strongly denied the claim.“We have all been shocked by the distressing revelations and allegations in recent weeks that particularly relate to the treatment of women in my workplace, in the Australian parliament,” Payne said in her International Women’s Day speech.She later told reporters the events had driven “a very broad national discussion about the treatment of women”.“Everywhere I have been in the last week or so outside Canberra, in regional New South Wales, in Sydney itself, Western Sydney where I live and where I work, for many people these have been the subject of discussion.”The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will conduct an independent inquiry into the workplace culture of Australia’s Parliament and report its findings by November.Rushton said the parliament needed to “set an example for the Australian public”.Morrison is resisting calls for another independent inquiry, into the historical allegations against Porter. Payne told ABC radio on Monday morning it was a “very vexed” situation, adding “the Prime Minister has made his position very clear”.Two cabinet ministers have taken leave amid the controversy. Porter has taken leave to improve his mental health. Defence minister Linda Reynolds has extended her medical leave.Reynolds first took leave on February 24 for a pre-existing heart problem in the wake of revelations a young female staff member had allegedly been raped on the couch in the defence minister’s office in 2019.",Reuters

U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Friday he opposes President Joe Biden's nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget, imperiling her chances of getting the job and introducing a new obstacle for the Democrats' agenda.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-omb/u-s-democrat-opposes-biden-budget-pick-tanden-risking-confirmation-and-complicating-agenda-idUSKBN2AJ2I6,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Friday he opposes President Joe Biden’s nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget, imperiling her chances of getting the job and introducing a new obstacle for the Democrats’ agenda.Biden told reporters he did not intend to pull the nomination. “I think we’re gonna find the votes to get her confirmed,” Biden said.Tanden has been criticized by Republicans - and some Democrats - over past harsh comments on social media, such as calling Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell “Moscow Mitch” and saying “vampires have more heart than (Senator) Ted Cruz.”Many Democrats scoffed at such concerns, noting near-unanimous Republican support for former President Donald Trump, who was accused of inciting a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol partly via inflammatory comments on Twitter and was known for blasting opponents - particularly women - as “nasty” or criminals who should be locked up.Manchin cited Tanden’s “public statements and tweets” in his statement. “I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” he said.His statement drew immediate condemnation, with some critics noting that the moderate Democrat - who represents the strongly Republican state of West Virginia - had backed some of Trump’s controversial nominees, including Richard Grenell to be ambassador to Germany.Democrats had questioned Grenell’s appointment because of his past statements insulting to women politicians on the internet and during cable television appearances.Manchin’s opposition underscored the influence that the moderate Democrat has over the ability of Biden’s Democrats to achieve the party’s policy goals, given their narrow control of the House and Senate.His statement came as congressional Democrats look to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill by the end of next week. Facing stiff Republican opposition, that measure could also hinge on Manchin.If every Senate Democrat had supported Tanden, she could have been confirmed without Republican votes since Democrats control 50 seats in the chamber and Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie.However, Manchin’s opposition means Tanden must be supported by a least one Republican.Tanden, who is Indian-American, would be the first woman of color to serve as director of the OMB, which serves as gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget.Questioned at her confirmation hearings about her tweets, Tanden apologized and said she regretted their tone.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised Tanden as “an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent Budget Director.” She said the administration would keep working toward her confirmation by engaging with both parties.If Tanden is not confirmed, it would be a setback in a presidential transition that was already delayed by Trump’s refusal - backed by many of his fellow Republicans - to recognize Biden’s victory in the November election even after repeated court decisions showed there had been no widespread fraud.So far, the handful of Biden nominees to have come before the Senate, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have been confirmed by comfortable margins with bipartisan support.Biden could also install Tanden as director of OMB by making her a recess appointment, a temporary measure that could her allow to run the office for nearly two years.",Reuters
258,Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump in presidential debut on world stage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-meeting-biden/biden-draws-sharp-contrast-with-trump-in-presidential-debut-on-world-stage-idUSKBN2AJ11Y,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday drew a sharp contrast with the foreign policy of his much-derided predecessor, Donald Trump, and urged democracies to work together to challenge abuses by autocratic states such as China and Russia.In his first big appearance as president on the global stage, an online “virtual visit” to Europe, Biden sought to re-establish the United States as a multilateral team player after four years of divisive “America First” policies under Trump.Speaking to the Munich Security Conference, the Democratic president distanced himself from the more transactional foreign policy of Republican Trump, who angered allies by breaking off global accords and threatening to end defense assistance unless they toed his line.“I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined - determined - to re-engage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership,” he said.Several years ago as a private citizen at the Munich Security Conference, Biden reassured participants rattled by the Trump presidency, telling them: “We will be back.” On Friday, he told the virtual online audience: “America is back.”Biden’s focus on collaboration echoed his message during a private videoconference earlier on Friday with the leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, a senior administration official said.Biden plans to join G7 members for an in-person summit hosted by Britain in June. His spokeswoman said he would not ask Russia to join the group, as had been proposed by Trump.U.S. partnerships had survived because they were “rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values,” Biden said. “They’re not transactional. They’re not extractive. They’re built on a vision of the future where every voice matters.”He said U.S. allies must stand firm against the challenges posed by China, Iran and Russia.“The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance,” he said. “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin seeks to weaken the European project and our NATO alliance. He wants to undermine our transatlantic unity and our resolve,” Biden said.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any such action.Biden stressed what he called America’s “unshakeable” commitment to the 30-member NATO alliance, another switch from Trump, who called NATO outdated and even suggested at one point that Washington could withdraw from the alliance.Biden also arrived bearing gifts - a $4 billion pledge of support for global coronavirus vaccination efforts, the re-entry of the United States into the Paris climate accord and the prospect of a nearly $2 trillion spending measure that could bolster both the U.S. and global economies.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined other leaders in cheering Biden’s remarks.“America is unreservedly back as the leader of the free world and that is a fantastic thing,” he told the conference.Biden said the world was at an inflection point, but he was convinced that democracies, not autocracies, offered the best path forward for the world.He said major market economies and democracies needed to work together to tackle challenges posed by great-power competitors like Russia and China, and global issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to climate change and cybersecurity.He took particular aim at China, the world’s second largest economy, and its failure to abide by international standards, arguing that democracies must shape the rules to govern the advance of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.“We have to push back against the Chinese government’s economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system,” he said.Chinese companies, he said, should be held to the same standards that applied to U.S. and European companies.“We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression,” he said.The Biden White House is reviewing China policy across all fronts, including China’s military buildup and trade policies, its actions in Hong Kong, treatment of minority Uighurs in Xinjiang and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the challenge posed by Iran’s nuclear program, Biden said the United States looked forward to re-engaging in diplomacy amid efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.The G7 countries, which control a little under half of the world economy, sought at their meeting to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic towards rebuilding their economies with free trade and countering China’s “non-market oriented” policies.",Reuters

Japan's COVID-19 inoculation campaign is moving at a glacial pace, hampered by a lack of supply and a shortage of specialty syringes that underscore the enormous challenge it faces in its aim to vaccinate every adult by the year's end.

Supplies are, however, expected to increase in the coming months.By contrast, South Korea, which began its vaccinations a week later than Japan, had administered nearly seven times more shots as of Sunday.Unlike many other countries, Japan requires clinical trials for new medicines, including vaccines, to be conducted with Japanese patients, slowing down the approval process.So far, only the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech has been approved. Clinical trials in Japan for AstraZeneca and Moderna’s vaccines have been conducted and the vaccines are now awaiting regulatory approval.“The sense of urgency among the government is not, I think, similar to other G7 countries,” said Haruka Sakamoto, a physician and researcher at Keio University, noting Japan’s comparatively low case numbers and death toll.Japan has had about 438,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 8,251 deaths. Cases in Tokyo, which is still under a state of emergency, have subsided from a daily peak of 2,520 on Jan. 7 to 237 on March 7.Sakamoto said the health ministry’s conservative stance stems from previous examples of a new medicine gaining approval relatively quickly only for the ministry to be criticised by the public and media for going too fast and endangering safety.The health ministry did not immediately reply with comment on the pace of the inoculation rollout.Japan is focusing on vaccinating about 4.8 million medical workers first before moving on to its elderly population of 36 million. Vaccine Minister Taro Kono has said that while shots for those over 65 will start next month, supplies will be extremely limited.Unlike South Korea, which has been using low dead space syringes to extract six or even seven doses of Pfizer vaccine from a vial instead of five, and 12 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine per vial instead of 10, Japan has fallen short on readying sufficient supply of the specialty syringes.That shortage will mean that some doses will go to waste when shots for the elderly start, Kono said on Friday.Japan is continuing to negotiate with Pfizer on supplies, Kono said, and imports are expected to increase four-fold in April from March to about 1.7 million vials. Each shipment must be approved by the European Union, which introduced the mechanism in late January to monitor vaccine exports after drug makers announced delays in their supplies to the bloc.Japan has secured rights to at least 564 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, the largest volume in Asia, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to have enough for the whole population by June, before the July 23 start of the Tokyo Olympics.",Reuters

More than 90% of Seoul’s contributions under the previous agreement went directly back into the South Korean economy, the spokeswoman added.The negotiations had been gridlocked after former U.S. President Donald Trump rejected Seoul’s offer to pay 13% more, for a total of about $1 billion a year, and demanded as much as $5 billion. Seoul currently pays Washington about $920 million a year.The deal must still be approved by the South Korean legislature. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry confirmed an agreement in principle in a statement, but offered no specifics.“Both sides will make a public announcement and hold a tentative signing ceremony after completing internal reporting procedures. The government will resolve to sign an agreement in a swift manner to resolve its vacuum that has lasted more than a year,” the ministry added.President Joe Biden has vowed to revitalize U.S. alliances after four years of strains under Trump and build a united front to counter the challenges posed by Russia, China and Iran.“Mr. Trump did what he believed was right and I respect his opinion, but more than anything else, I was disappointed at the way he asked,” said Chun In-bum, a retired South Korean general and special forces commander who worked with the American military.‘NOT A FREELOADER’South Korea began paying for the U.S. troop presence in the early 1990s, after rebuilding its war-devastated economy. The two countries signed a treaty of mutual defense at the end of the 1950-1953 Korean War, which provided the basis for the stationing of U.S. forces in South Korea.Chun said the new deal was a win for the alliance because it would improve the overall conditions for U.S. forces, while the six-year extension would provide much-needed stability“I hope that this agreement will highlight the fact that ‘Korea is not a freeloader’ and is and has been a reliable ally,” he said.The announcement came after South Korea’s chief envoy, Jeong Eun-bo, arrived in Washington for the first face-to-face talks with U.S. envoy Donna Welton since Biden’s administration took office in January.After the last pact expired, some 4,000 South Koreans working for the U.S. military were placed on unpaid leave, prompting the two countries to scramble for a stopgap agreement to let them return to work.The United States reached agreement with Japan last month on Tokyo’s contribution to the stationing of about 55,000 U.S. forces there, keeping Japan’s annual costs steady at about $1.9 billion.",Reuters

The 70-year security alliance between the United States and South Korea is under fresh focus as the allies reached an agreement on Sunday under which Seoul will pay higher costs for hosting American troops as deterrence against North Korea.

The deal provided the basis for the stationing of U.S. forces in South Korea.In 1966, the two countries signed the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), which laid down the rules governing and protecting U.S. personnel stationed in South Korea.The agreement’s Article V says the United States will bear all costs for U.S. troops’ maintenance, except those to be borne by South Korea, which included furnishing and compensating for “all facilities and areas and rights of way”.To determine South Korea’s contribution to the cost of U.S. troops as described in SOFA, the two countries have signed Special Measures Agreements, or SMAs, 10 times since 1991, usually to cover multiple years.Under the last agreement, reached in February 2019 for one year, South Korea agreed to increase its contribution to just under 1.04 trillion won ($921.5 million), an 8.2% hike from the previous deal.The allies reached a new, six-year deal at talks on Sunday, where Seoul agreed to a “meaningful increase” in its share, ending two years of standoff.Former U.S. President Donald Trump had demanded $5 billion, a five-fold jump, rejecting South Korea’s offer to pay about 13% more.South Korean sources had raised hopes that President Joe Biden’s administration would agree to a deal close to their proposal.There are about 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea, the United States’ third-largest military presence outside its country after Japan and Germany, according to data from the U.S. Defense Manpower Data Center.U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) operates about 90 combat planes, 40 attack helicopters, 50 tanks and some 60 Patriot missile launchers, according to South Korea’s Defence White Paper issued in December.USFK data showed it had about 19,500 Army soldiers, 7,800 airmen and women, 350 Navy sailors and 120 Marines stationed in South Korea.Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, is the largest U.S. overseas military base, housing the USFK headquarters and thousands of troops, civilian workers and their family members. Other major bases include Army Garrison Yongsan in central Seoul, Camp Walker in the southeastern city of Daegu, and two air bases in Osan and Gunsan, south of Seoul.Out of Seoul’s 1-billion-won contribution in 2019, 48% was used to pay salaries to some 9,000 South Koreans hired by U.S. troops, 36% to cover construction costs such as building facilities within U.S. bases, and the rest for military assistance expenses including services and materials, according to South Korea’s Defence White Paper.More than 90% of the costs South Korea shouldered in 2019 went directly back into its economy, a State Department official said.Seoul had been pursuing a multi-year accord as the allies renew it every three five or years, with drawn-out negotiations often creating a vacuum.After the 2019 pact expired with no new deal, about 4,000 South Korean workers of the USFK were placed on unpaid leave, prompting the two countries to scramble for a stopgap agreement to allow them to return to work.($1 = 1,128.5500 won)",Reuters
270,"Trump’s former fixer Cohen interviewed by Manhattan DA’s office and newly hired litigator
The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and a newly hired high-profile litigator interviewed Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Thursday, as part of a criminal probe of the former president’s business dealings, said two people familiar with the investigation.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-investigation-cohen/trumps-former-fixer-cohen-interviewed-by-manhattan-das-office-and-newly-hired-litigator-idUSKBN2AJ05R,"(Reuters) - The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office and a newly hired high-profile litigator interviewed Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Thursday, as part of a criminal probe of the former president’s business dealings, said two people familiar with the investigation.The interview came after Mark Pomerantz, who has extensive experience in white-collar and organized crime cases, joined District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s team investigating the Trump family business. Pomerantz started on Feb. 2 as special assistant district attorney, said Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance.Pomerantz’s hiring is part of a flurry of recent activity in Vance’s investigation, including the issuance in recent days of roughly a dozen new subpoenas, according to the sources. One of those went to Ladder Capital Finance LLC, a major creditor used by Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, to finance the former president’s commercial real estate holdings, the sources said.Vance’s office has also conducted interviews with Ladder’s staff, one source familiar with the matter said. Ladder did not reply to requests for comment.The district attorney’s office has said little publicly about the probe, but noted in court filings that it was focused on “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct” at the Trump Organization, including alleged falsification of records, and insurance and tax fraud. It is the only known criminal inquiry into Trump’s business practices.Separately, New York state Attorney General Letitia James is leading a civil probe into whether Trump’s company falsely reported property values to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits.Ladder issued the loans on several of Trump’s big commercial holdings, including a $160 million mortgage on the Trump Building, a skyscraper in Manhattan’s financial district.It was unclear what was covered in Cohen’s interview on Thursday with Pomerantz - his fifth with Vance’s office. But it signals intense interest in Cohen’s intimate knowledge of the financial affairs of the Trump Organization.Cohen declined to comment. A representative for Trump and a lawyer for the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Frost, Vance’s spokesman, declined to comment on areas of the inquiry beyond Pomerantz’s appointment.In court filings, the Trump Organization has denied that the company inflated assets. Trump, a Republican, has described the New York investigations as politically motivated. Vance and James are both Democrats.To look for anomalies among property deals, Vance’s office has retained forensic accounting specialists from Washington-based FTI Consulting Inc, a person familiar with the investigation said. An FTI spokesman declined to comment.Cohen, who describes himself as Trump’s longtime, do-anything fixer, is in home confinement serving a three-year sentence on charges related to payoffs he made during the 2016 presidential race to buy the silence of two women who alleged they had affairs with Trump.Vance opened the investigation in 2018 to examine the alleged hush-money payments. The probe has since expanded to include Trump’s conduct as a private business owner and whether the Trump Organization engaged in criminal tax evasion among other charges.Pomerantz, 69, was chief of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York from 1997 to 1999 and oversaw a successful racketeering case against former Gambino crime family boss John “Junior” Gotti.As a private attorney, Pomerantz has regularly represented major companies and officials in state and federal prosecutions, including cases brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. He has handled matters involving charges of corporate misconduct, financial fraud, tax crimes and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a federal law used to prosecute organized crime and ongoing criminal activities.Pomerantz, who has taken a leave of absence from his law firm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his involvement in the district attorney’s investigation.Cohen, a potential high-profile witness for Vance, pleaded guilty in 2018 to charges in the hush-money case, as well as allegations of lying to Congress about negotiations concerning a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow, a project that never materialized.Trump and Republicans in Congress have sought to undermine Cohen’s credibility by underscoring how he lied under oath. At his sentencing hearing, Cohen said he took “full responsibility” for his actions, but said the payments were made “in coordination” and “at the direction” of Trump in an effort to influence the election’s outcome.He also said Trump implicitly directed him to lie about the Moscow project.Trump accused Cohen of lying to reduce his prison time.“I think Cohen may be more valuable than people are giving him credit for,” said Daniel Alonso, Vance’s top deputy from 2010 to 2014 and now in private practice.“He obviously has committed perjury. He has credibility issues. But the perjury he committed was allegedly at the behest of Donald Trump, at least tacitly. I don’t think that calling Cohen a perjurer ends the story, because that opens the door to the explanation of why he perjured himself.”",Reuters

In hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” the 50-year-old Republican told reporters as he returned to Houston.Cruz said he had planned to stay through the weekend, but had second thoughts “almost the moment I sat down on the plane.”In text messages obtained by American Bridge, a Democratic political group, Cruz’s wife Heidi asked neighbors whether they wanted to accompany the family to Cancun.“Anyone can or want to leave for the week?” she wrote, noting that rooms at the city’s Ritz Carlton cost “$309 plus tax.”With millions of Texans grappling with the fallout from a ferocious winter storm, Cruz, viewed as a presidential hopeful in 2024, faced condemnation after photos on social media showed him in an airport line, in a passenger lounge, aboard an airliner and leaving Cancun International Airport in Mexico.Some critics slammed his comments blaming his daughters, aged 10 and 12, for his decision to visit the resort, where the weather was a balmy 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius) on Thursday evening. The Texas Democratic Party called on him to resign.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki, speaking before Cruz was spotted at Cancun airport, said tongue-in-cheek: “I don’t have any updates on the exact location of Senator Ted Cruz, nor does anyone at the White House.”Millions of Texans remained paralyzed by power and water outages after a winter storm and freezing temperatures that hampered efforts to restore full power.Some 2.7 million Texas households were without heat on Wednesday and leaders warned of a domino effect on infrastructure as the lack of power cut off water supplies, strained the ability of hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients and isolated vulnerable communities cut off by frozen roads.“We need to be here, we need to be in the battle, we need to be helping Texans,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told MSNBC when asked about Cruz.Cruz, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, won re-election to the Senate in 2018 by eking out a victory over Democrat Beto O’Rourke by less than 3 percentage points. He is not due to run again until 2024.In December, Cruz criticized Austin, Texas, mayor Stephen Adler on Twitter for taking a trip to Mexico in December while telling others not to travel during the pandemic.",Reuters

Nearly 400,000 childcare jobs have been lost since the outset of the pandemic, Harris said. (COVID-19 graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)The COVID-19 pandemic has had an outsized impact on women, who lost jobs at a higher rate than men and have struggled to return to the workforce because of the need to care for children unable to attend school.Specific carveouts in the COVID-19 relief bill are designed to address problems faced by women, including an investment of $40 billion in childcare, paid family leave for 100 million additional workers and an investment of $130 billion to help re-open K-12 schools safely.“For me this is personal.... The longer we wait to act, the harder it will be to bring these women back into the work force,” Harris told the group calling the situation where 2.5 million women have left the workforce a “national emergency.”That compares with 1.8 million men who have left the work force during the same period, according to Labor Department data.“In one year...the pandemic has put decades of the progress we have collectively made for women workers at risk,” she said.Harris said the package would “lift up nearly half of the children who are living in poverty in our country,” a claim backed by analysis by Columbia University.Attendees included House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Representative Barbara Lee and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.Harris has already been deeply involved in policy and diplomacy in the early weeks of President Joe Biden’s administration. Earlier she met with Black Chambers of Commerce and Black mayors at a meeting convened by the African American Mayors Association to talk about COVID-19 relief, and this week held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron.Harris’ meeting on Thursday occurred as Congress has more female members than ever before, with 27% of all seats, more than double the number in 2001. The vast majority of women lawmakers are Democrats, and a growing percentage of women have voted for Democrats in recent elections. Black women rallied behind Biden during critical turns in his 2020 presidential campaign.Murray said women are facing challenges with remote learning for children, so they must get them back into schools safely. “Women are leaving the work force because of this,” she said.The meeting also included Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable; Jen Earle, National Association of Women Business Owners; Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry and Tina Tchen, CEO of the anti-sexual harassment group Time’s UP.“Our economy cannot fully recover unless women can participate fully,” Harris said.",Reuters

A Kremlin spokesman denied the U.S. claim Russia was spreading false information about vaccines to the WSJ.Russia’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russia approved its Sputnik V vaccine in August, before a large-scale trial had begun, saying it was the first country to do so for a COVID-19 shot. Peer-reviewed trials months later proved it was almost 92% effective in fighting the virus.Pfizer, headquartered in New York, and Germany’s BioNTech, produced the first vaccine that was authorized in the United States, which regulators approved in December. The second, made by Moderna, headquartered in Massachusetts, was authorized later that month.The State Department’s Global Engagement Center, set up to counter propaganda and disinformation campaigns, identified the three outlets, the spokeswoman said.News Front is controlled by Russia’s federal security service, the center found. New Eastern Outlook and Oriental Review are directed and controlled by the Russian foreign intelligence service.A fourth outlet, Rebel Inside, controlled by the Russian army, was also named by the center but is largely dormant, the spokeswoman said.“The Department will continue to expose Russia’s nefarious activities online,” she added. “We will also continue to work closely with our allies and partners to provide a global response to countering disinformation.”",Reuters

A sprawling camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, within sight of the Texan border, has since 2019 been one of the most powerful reminders of the human toll of former President Donald Trump's efforts to keep migrants out of the United States.
MAR 07 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-mexico-feature/mexican-camp-that-was-symbol-of-migrant-misery-empties-out-under-biden-idUSKBN2AZ0GB,"MATAMOROS, Mexico (Reuters) - A sprawling camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, within sight of the Texan border, has since 2019 been one of the most powerful reminders of the human toll of former President Donald Trump’s efforts to keep migrants out of the United States.The camp has emptied out in recent days, after hundreds of asylum seekers living there were finally allowed to cross the border to press their claim to stay in the United States.President Joe Biden last month rolled back the program - known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) - that had forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico.Biden’s wife, Jill, visited the camp during last year’s presidential campaign to witness the difficult conditions first hand.“If it hadn’t been for this camp, I don’t think they would have ever ended MPP,” said Honduran asylum seeker Oscar Borjas, one of the few remaining residents who has not yet been permitted to cross.The last few people remaining in the camp were relocated to more secure locations identified by international aid groups where they could complete required paperwork, a U.S. official told Reuters late on Saturday.Like hundreds of asylum seekers expelled from the United States to this crime-ridden town, Borjas began sleeping near the foot of the international bridge across the Rio Grande out of fear and necessity.But the migrants also intended to make a statement, he said: a visible reminder of the human toll of the MPP program. “We were there so that people would see us; see it wasn’t fair what they were doing to us.”As of Friday, some 1,127 people in the MPP program across Mexico have been permitted to enter the United States since Biden rescinded the policy last month. More than half of those were from the Matamoros camp, according to the U.N. refugee agency. More than 700 enrolled in the program have been processed across the border in Brownsville, Texas, according to officials.Once home to more than 3,000 people, the camp now stands deserted, as nearly all remaining residents left voluntarily for shelters over the weekend after receiving assurances from the United Nation’s refugee agency that their asylum cases would still be considered.On Saturday, agents from Mexican migration agents began dismantling the camp’s ramshackle structures.“I don’t know what I’ll do now. I can’t go back,” said Borjas, who said he faces the threat of murder in Honduras for supporting an opposition party.“LET’S UNITE”The Trump administration touted the MPP program as part of its successful efforts to reduce immigration and cut down on what it called fraudulent asylum claims.Since 2019, the policy pushed more than 65,000 migrants back into Mexico as their asylum cases wound through U.S. courts. The majority gave up waiting and left Mexico. Thousands more crowded into shelters or apartments, disappearing from sight.But in Matamoros, which had scant resources for migrants, families opted to sleep in the plaza at the foot of the bridge.“We said ‘Let’s unite’ and that’s how the camp in Matamoros began,” said Honduran asylum seeker Josue Cornejo, who was returned to Matamoros along with his wife and their children in August 2019.Parents scavenged cardboard to stop the summer heat radiating off the pavement from burning their children’s skin. The men formed a guard watch.Aid workers arrived. So did Matamoros’ criminal groups, which doled out beatings and siphoned off donations, migrants say.As the camp population ballooned, the tents sprawled from the plaza to the wooded banks of the Rio Grande, where residents braved contamination and undercurrents to bathe and wash their clothes.The migrants resisted federal government efforts to house them in a makeshift shelter miles from the border.Life took root in a way migrants say they had never expected, making the lengthy wait in Mexico slightly more bearable.They formed church groups, supply distribution tents and kitchens with handmade earthen ovens and stoves improvised from old washing machines.Nicaraguan asylum seeker Perla Vargas and other migrants launched a tent school that provided music, dance, English and Spanish classes to dozens of children each day, including her two grandchildren.There were quinceaneras, romances, and at least one wedding.Consuelo Tomas, an indigenous Q’anjob’al Guatemalan asylum seeker, gave birth inside the camp and named her newborn Andrea in honor of the child’s grandmother, who died years earlier trying to cross the Sonoran desert to reach the United States.Insecurity and hardship reigned.The weather whiplashed between scorching heat and freezing cold. Human rights groups documented kidnappings and rape of asylum seekers in Matamoros. Occasionally, migrants’ bodies washed up along the river bank.Some mothers, including Salvadoran asylum seeker Sandra Andrade, sent their children to cross the U.S. border alone illegally out of concern for their safety.“It was one of the most difficult decisions I’ve had to make, but I wanted to protect them,” she said.At times, the camp served as the launch pad for protests: from a blockade of the international bridge that halted traffic for hours to demonstrations and all-night vigils opposing Trump’s re-election.Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, said that MPP program might have succeeded in obscuring the plight of these migrants from the American public if it were not for the Matamoros camp.“It was the one place where you couldn’t deny that what we were doing was inflicting harm on people,” he said.Last month, the Biden administration said it would allow about 25,000 migrants in MPP to enter the United States to pursue their cases. Matamoros camp residents were to be among the first in line, it added.Buoyed by the news, migrants had prepared for their departure in late February: snapping farewell photographs and snipping haircuts for fellow migrants. The sound of bachata music rang out as children hopped about, rehearsing for their final dance recital. Andrade packed up her remaining protest signs and distributed donated pairs of tiny sneakers.“It’s so the kids can cross into the United States in brand new shoes,” she said.",Reuters

Instead, the unsung backbone of any Olympics - its corps of volunteers - has had to recalibrate lives, put vacations or returns to home countries on hold and seek out part-time jobs in Japan so they are still free to volunteer.Volunteers acknowledged their uncertainty was small in the face of the pandemic’s brutal global cost, but it’s nonetheless taking a toll. Even as organisers swear the Games will go ahead as rescheduled this summer, some are nervous and pondering changes of plan.“I’m actually wavering about taking part now,” said Yamamura, 40, who lives in southwestern Japan, far from Tokyo.“Getting to Tokyo is expensive, and thanks to the pandemic, my finances are unstable. But the biggest reason is, it’s really hard to maintain motivation in this unclear situation.”Roughly 80,000 people were recruited by Tokyo 2020 organisers, with another 30,000 by the Tokyo government and more by local administrations, to take care of everything from translating and guiding people to driving visitors around and venue management. A rich part of the Olympic tradition, they range from university students to retirees and come from all around the world.Some 1,000 of the 2020 organiser’s volunteers have quit, while the Tokyo side has seen fewer than 200 leave - neither of which, officials say, will have any impact on hosting the Games. Several hundred left due to sexist remarks by the president of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, but after he quit some wanted to return.‘MIXED SIGNALS’Organisers insist all systems are go, but signals are mixed, volunteers interviewed by Reuters say. Overseas volunteers have been emailed detailed schedules by organisers, but then told to verify whether they can enter Japan at all amid strict pandemic immigration rules.Games organisers said volunteers know when they apply to take part that they need to tackle logistics themselves, but hints are available on the Tokyo 2020 website. They say they can’t yet confirm how many will be coming from overseas.Email communications from Olympics organisers are also sharply down compared with this time last year, volunteers say. Organisers say they have given volunteers regular updates since last year’s postponement, and that email communication will increase as the Games draw closer.Last year’s Games were postponed in late March, just before the torch relay was due to start - a precedent that means many see the scheduled torch relay start this year, on March 25, as a key moment.“I had a whole life planned ... and then after the Olympics I’d finally go home, and I’d start a new life,” said a Canadian English teacher in southwestern Japan, 36, declining to be named citing sensitivities around his work situation.“I’m still here and in limbo, not knowing exactly what to do,” the teacher said. “I put all of my eggs in a basket that seeped right through my fingers.”By this time last year he was re-arranging work and booking travel to Tokyo - concerns magnified for overseas volunteers that Claire Dawn-Marie Gittens, 39 and a Rio 2016 Games volunteer returning for the 2020 Games, understands.“When I booked for Rio, ticket prices changed by the day,” said Gittens, a long-term Japan resident from Barbados. “Then making sure you can find somewhere to stay ... People need to get to work on this.”Asked if the Olympics could downscale volunteer numbers, organisers said they’ll monitor conditions to hold a safe and secure Games.If the Olympics do take place, they may be muted compared with the fun many volunteers anticipated.“We’re told hospitality has to change, so you aren’t in direct contact much (with spectators),” said Sawako Anada, a 47-year-old physical therapist in Kawagoe, a city near Tokyo set to host golf.“You hold up a big card that can be seen from a distance and gesture, convey your welcome physically like that ... We’re being told to ‘Be friendly from afar’.”",Reuters

I’m in favor of the rights of women,” he said, pledging never to repress the free assembly of protesters.Similar metallic barriers were erected around the nearby orange-domed Fine Arts Palace, including its towering bronze sculptures, as city officials announced plans to deploy police downtown to protect marchers as well as the monuments, including some 2,000 female police officers.",Reuters

A health official had earlier told TVGE the death toll was at least 20.Pick-up trucks filled with survivors, including children, drove up to the front of a local hospital.Inside, wards were overwhelmed with the wounded, many covered in blood. Some lay on the floor or on tables, awaiting attention.TVGE called on people to donate blood and said hospitals in the Central African nation were full.The blasts come as Equatorial Guinea, an oil producer, is suffering a double economic shock because of the coronavirus pandemic and a drop in the price of crude, which provides around three-quarters of state revenue.The former Spanish colony has been run by Obiang, Africa’s longest-serving leader, since 1979 when he staged a bloody military coup and ousted his uncle, who was later executed.Critics point out that Obiang and his family enjoy lavish wealth while the majority of the population lives in poverty.In the blast area on Sunday, iron roofs were ripped off houses and lay twisted amid the rubble. Only a wall or two remained of most residences.In the immediate aftermath, people ran in all directions, many of them dazed and screaming.A column of smoke reached into the sky and around its base firefighters sought to put out the blaze.“Following developments in Equatorial Guinea with concern after the explosions in the city of Bata,” Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said on Twitter.The Spanish Embassy in Malabo said Spanish nationals should stay in their homes.",Reuters

Too many Americans were left waiting weeks for important deliveries of mail and packages,” DeJoy said last week, apologizing to customers.Last week, USPS reported $318 million of income for the quarter ended Dec. 31, delivering a record 1.1 billion holiday season packages, while first-class mail revenue decreased by $177 million.USPS reported net losses totaling $86.7 billion from 2007 through 2020.

285,Texas ranchers scramble to keep animals alive in unusual cold,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-weather-cattle/texas-ranchers-scramble-to-keep-animals-alive-in-unusual-cold-idUSKBN2AI1K3,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Texas ranchers worked overtime to haul water and hay to cattle to keep them alive during a freak winter storm, but some cows have already succumbed to unusual icy temperatures that also killed chickens, idled meat plants and threatened crops.The deaths of baby cows in the top U.S. cattle state and struggles to care for surviving livestock are the latest challenges for ranchers who over the past year have dealt with COVID-19 cutting demand for meat at restaurants and shuttering slaughterhouses.In Texas, home to more than 13 million cattle, ranchers said they are spending long, cold hours breaking up ice in water tanks and on frozen ponds so animals have something to drink. Icy conditions have turned diesel fuel into a useless gel in tractors. Ranchers said they are using gasoline-powered pickup trucks to transport hay that cattle can eat and use for warm bedding.Kaylin Isbell, a rancher in Florence, Texas, said a few cows and sheep had died after birth. Babies are particularly vulnerable to the shock of the cold when they leave their mothers’ warm wombs covered in fluid. Isbell said her mother-in-law took newly born sheep into a spare bedroom in her home to keep them warm.The cold will also kill oats Isbell planted for young cattle to graze on, she said. As a result, Isbell said she will need to sell the animals earlier than expected, reducing her profit margins.Ranchers nationwide were already facing higher feed costs as corn and soybean prices soared to multi-year highs.“We just keep going,” Isbell said. “That’s all you can do.”Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told Reuters that baby chicks are freezing to death because there is not enough natural gas to heat hatcheries. He said dairy operations are dumping $8 million worth of milk down the drains daily because milk processing plants are without power. Grain mills across the state cannot manufacture animal feed without power either, Miller said.“We’ve got an animal welfare issue going on,” he said.Major meat processors like Cargill Inc and Tyson Foods Inc said they suspended operations at some plants.In Whitesboro, Texas, fifth-generation rancher Austin Miles said he is filling a red 300-gallon tank with water from a hose at his parents’ home two to three times a day and shuttling it to cattle to drink. The pond they would normally drink from froze, he said.“This is extreme for us,” Miles said. “Our infrastructure was just not quite set up for these prolonged cold periods.”The storm has killed at least 21 people across four states, and temperatures are forecast to remain 20 to 35 degrees below average across parts of the central and southern United States for days.Cattle could suffer from respiratory problems once the deep freeze gives way to warmer temperatures, said Missy Bonds, assistant general manager of her family’s ranch in Saginaw, Texas.“Mother Nature needs a Xanax,” she said.",Reuters

Now they’re cast off,” her lawyer Hojjat Kermani told an Iranian website. “She has been freed.”Iran’s judiciary was not immediately available to comment about the release. Her family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of media firm Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charge.Kermani said a hearing for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s second case has been scheduled on March 14.“In this case, she is accused of propaganda against the Islamic Republic’s system for participating in a rally in front of the Iranian Embassy in London in 2009 and giving interview to the BBC Persian TV channel at the same time,” Kermani said.He said he hoped that “this case will be closed at this stage, considering the previous investigation”.In a tweet, Johnson said he was “pleased to see the removal of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s ankle tag, but her continued confinement remains totally unacceptable”.The prime minister added, “She must be released permanently so she can return to her family in the UK, and we continue to do all we can to achieve this”.Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband Richard Ratcliffe told Sky News on Sunday she was “pleased” her ankle tag had been removed but said the news was “mixed” from Iran due to the court summons. Ratcliffe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Antonio Zappulla, CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, said the foundation was “delighted that her jail term was ended” and that she had told him she was “‘ecstatic’ to be able to sit in a cafe and have a coffee”.“Nazanin must be given her freedom, as was promised.”British foreign minister Dominic Raab welcomed the removal of the ankle tag but said Iran continued to put Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family through a “cruel and an intolerable ordeal”.“We have relayed to the Iranian authorities in the strongest possible terms that her continued confinement is unacceptable,” Raab said in a statement.Her lawyer told Iranian state TV he had no news on the status of her travel ban.The detentions of dozens of dual nationals and foreigners have complicated ties between Tehran and several European countries including Germany, France and Britain, all parties to Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers.The release come as Iran and the United States are trying to revive the deal, which former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, then reimposing sanctions on Iran. Tehran responded by scaling down its compliance.",Reuters

A highly anticipated Oprah Winfrey interview with Prince Harry and his wife Meghan airs on U.S. television later on Sunday, amid what one royal watcher called a ""toxic"" atmosphere between the couple and the British monarchy.

Queen Elizabeth celebrated the unity forged by the coronavirus pandemic to mark Commonwealth Day in a broadcast speech. Her son Prince Charles, joined by other royals, hailed the courage shown during the crisis.The decision to do the sit-down interview with Winfrey, recorded some two weeks ago, has already attracted criticism, partly because it will air while Harry’s 99-year-old grandfather Prince Philip, the queen’s husband, is in hospital.He underwent a procedure for a pre-existing heart condition on Wednesday.There have also been allegations of bullying against Meghan which first appeared in The Times newspaper. It said a senior aide raised a complaint in October 2018 from staff alleging Meghan had reduced some of her assistants to tears and treated others so badly that they quit.Buckingham Palace, which has made no comment on the interview, said it would investigate the claims, saying it was “very concerned”.In response to the report, a spokeswoman for Meghan said she was “saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself.”Fitzwilliams said the Palace’s move appeared to be a “pre-emptive strike” ahead of the interview.The Winfrey interview is set to be broadcast in Britain on Monday as well as in many other countries around the world.“I have not seen enthusiasm at this level for a royals-related story since the weddings - the royal weddings of both Meghan and Harry and William and Kate,” said Michelle Tauber, senior editor for U.S. magazine People.",Reuters

It was not clear whether anyone was hurt.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a non-profit, said the army was “intentionally terrorizing residents” in Yangon.The show of force came after some of the largest nationwide protests since the Feb. 1 coup, and an alliance of nine unions said they planned a “full extended shutdown” of the economy.“To continue economic and business activities as usual...will only benefit the military as they repress the energy of the Myanmar people,” they said in a joint statement. “The time to take action in defence of our democracy is now.”A spokesman for the military did not answer calls seeking comment and Reuters was unable to reach police for comment. The army has said it is dealing with protests lawfully.An official from the party of deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi died overnight in police custody. National League for Democracy (NLD) official Khin Maung Latt had worked as a campaign manager for one of two Muslim MPs elected in 2020.Ba Myo Thein, a member of parliament’s upper house which was dissolved after the coup, said reports of bruising to Khin Maung Latt’s head and body raised suspicions that he had been abused.“It seems that he was arrested at night and tortured severely,” he told Reuters. “This is totally unacceptable.”Police in Pabedan, the Yangon district where Khin Maung Latt was arrested, declined to comment.Sunday saw some of the biggest protests in recent weeks. Police fired stun grenades and tear gas to break up a sit-in by tens of thousands of people in Mandalay, the Myanmar Now media group said. At least 70 people were arrested.Police also launched tear gas and stun grenades in the direction of protesters in Yangon and in the town of Lashio in the northern Shan region, videos posted on Facebook showed.A witness said police opened fire to break up a protest in the historic temple town of Bagan, and several residents said in social media posts that live bullets were used.Video posted by Myanmar Now showed soldiers beating up men in Yangon, where at least three protests were held despite overnight raids by security forces on campaign leaders and opposition activists.Sithu Maung, the NLD MP who worked with Khin Maung Latt, said soldiers and police detained his father on Sunday night.“They broke into the house… and point with guns, I was told,” he said in a Facebook post, adding that his father was also beaten.The United Nations says security forces have killed more than 50 people to quell daily demonstrations and strikes since the military overthrew and detained Suu Kyi on Feb. 1.“They are killing people just like killing birds and chickens,” one protest leader said to the crowd in Dawei, a town in Myanmar’s south. “What will we do if we don’t revolt against them? We must revolt.”State-run Global New Light Of Myanmar newspaper quoted a police statement as saying security forces were dealing with the protests in accordance with law. It said the forces were using tear gas and stun grenades to break up rioting and protests that were blocking public roads.Well over 1,700 people had been detained under the military junta by Saturday, according to figures from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group.The killings have drawn anger in the West and been condemned by most democracies in Asia. The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta.China, Myanmar’s giant neighbour to the northeast, said on Sunday it is prepared to engage with “all parties” to ease the crisis and is not taking sides.Australia said it suspended a bilateral defence cooperation program with the military following the coup and its development program would engage only with non-government organizations.Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and respect for November’s election - which her party won in a landslide but which the army rejected. The army has said it will hold democratic elections at an unspecified date.",Reuters

Pope Francis heard Muslim and Christian residents in the ruined Iraqi city of Mosul tell of their lives under brutal Islamic State rule on Sunday, blessing their vow to rise up from ashes and promising them ""fraternity is more durable than fratricide.""

He sat surrounded by skeletons of buildings, dangling concrete staircases, and cratered ancient churches, most too dangerous to enter.“Together we say no to fundamentalism. No to sectarianism and no to corruption,” the Chaldean archbishop of Mosul, Najeeb Michaeel, told the pope.Much of the old city was destroyed in 2017 during the bloody battle by Iraqi forces and an international military coalition to drive out Islamic State.Francis, who flew to Mosul by helicopter, was visibly moved by the earthquake-like devastation around him. He prayed for all of the city’s dead.“How cruel it is that this country, the cradle of civilization, should have been afflicted by so barbarous a blow, with ancient places of worship destroyed and many thousands of people – Muslims, Christians, Yazidis and others – forcibly displaced or killed,” he said.“Today, however, we reaffirm our conviction that fraternity is more durable than fratricide, that hope is more powerful than hatred, that peace more powerful than war.”Intense security has surrounded his trip to Iraq. Military pickup trucks mounted with machine guns escorted his motorcade and plainclothes security men mingled in Mosul with the handles of guns emerging from black backpacks worn on their chests.In an apparent direct reference to Islamic State, Francis said hope could never be “silenced by the blood spilled by those who pervert the name of God to pursue paths of destruction.”He then read a prayer repeating one of the main themes of his trip, that it is always wrong to hate, kill or wage war in God’s name.Fighters of Islamic State, a Sunni militant group that tried to establish a caliphate across the region, ravaged northern Iraq from 2014-2017, killing Christians as well as Muslims who opposed them.‘AFRAID TO RETURN’Iraq’s Christian community, one of the oldest in the world, has been particularly devastated by the years of conflict, falling to about 300,000 from about 1.5 million before the U.S. invasion of 2003 and the brutal Islamist militant violence that followed.Father Raid Adel Kallo, pastor of the destroyed Church of the Annunciation, told how in 2014 he fled with 500 Christian families and how fewer than 70 families are present now.“The majority have emigrated and are afraid to return,” he said.“But I live here, with two million Muslims who call me father and I am living my mission with them,” he added, telling the pope of a committee of Mosul families who promote peaceful coexistence among Muslims and Christians.A Muslim member of the Mosul committee, Gutayba Aagha, urged the Christians who had fled to “return to their properties and resume their activities”.Francis flew by helicopter to Qaraqosh, a Christian enclave that was overrun by Islamic State fighters, and visited a church whose courtyard was used by the insurgents as a firing practice range.He then said Mass in Erbil, capital of the autonomous Kurdistan region, where thousands of people packed a stadium.In both Qaraqosh and Erbil, he received the most tumultuous welcomes of his visit. And in both places most people were not wearing masks or practicing social distancing despite a rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country.“This visit gives us hope and courage, it’s as if we’re celebrating a new life,” said Frdos Zora, a nun at the stadium Mass.At the end of the Mass, the last official event before he returns to Rome on Monday, Francis told the crowd, “Iraq will always remain with me, in my heart”.He closed by saying “salam, salam, salam” (peace, peace, peace) in Arabic.",Reuters

The European Union should shake off its ill will and build a good relationship with Britain as sovereign equals, Britain's top EU adviser David Frost said on Sunday, promising to stand up for the country's interests.

London ultimately agreed to leave the British-ruled province aligned to the EU’s single market for goods to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, fearing it could be detrimental to the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of conflict in the province.This has required checks on some items arriving in Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the United Kingdom, which some businesses say has made it difficult to bring in supplies. To address that issue, the British government extended the grace period for some checks until Oct. 1.The EU disputes that the grace period extension was in line with the agreement, saying London should honour what it signed up to. It has promised to launch legal action, or a so-called “infringement procedure” against Britain.",Reuters

Cairo restored diplomatic relations that month and Riyadh said it would do so.Fellow Gulf Arab state Kuwait last month hosted bilateral talks with Qatar and Egypt, and with Qatar and the UAE, aimed at resolving individual differences.",Reuters

The Biden administration on Wednesday said it would scrap a Trump-era proposal to weaken environmental protections for millions of acres of California desert to ease development of wind and solar energy projects.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-desert/biden-scraps-trump-plan-to-weaken-environmental-rules-to-build-renewables-in-california-idUSKBN2AH2SH,"(Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday said it would scrap a Trump-era proposal to weaken environmental protections for millions of acres of California desert to ease development of wind and solar energy projects.The move is President Joe Biden’s latest effort to roll back his predecessor’s four-year legacy of energy and environmental deregulation. Former President Donald Trump’s administration made a last-minute push to accelerate energy development on public lands, including by amending the so-called Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan just days before leaving office.In the coming days, Biden’s Department of Interior will revoke the public comment period on those plan amendments, a spokesman for the agency said in an emailed statement.Biden supports building more renewable energy installations on public lands, but his administration said the original DRECP balanced wind and solar development with conservation and outdoor recreation.“The Trump administration’s proposal in its final days to re-open the plan is unnecessary and at odds with balanced land management,” Laura Daniel Davis, Interior’s principal deputy secretary for land and minerals management, said in a statement.The DRECP was hatched jointly with the state of California during the presidency of Barack Obama and set aside areas for renewable energy development. Last month, Trump’s Interior said the changes were needed for California to meet its goal to phase out the use of fossil fuels.Some wind and solar developers opposed the Obama-era strategy because they said it left millions of acres off-limits to their projects.This month, the California Wind Energy Association sent a letter to Interior saying that the DRECP amendments proposed by the previous administration “may be consistent with the Administration’s climate policy goals and urge that it be considered.”An Interior official would not comment on the letter.",Reuters
297,White House says Biden supports study of slavery reparations,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-slavery/white-house-says-biden-supports-study-of-slavery-reparations-idUSKBN2AH2K9,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden supports a study on whether descendants of enslaved people in the United States should receive reparations, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Wednesday, as the issue was being debated on Capitol Hill.Psaki told reporters that Biden “continues to demonstrate his commitment to take comprehensive action to address the systemic racism that persists today.”Reparations have been used in other circumstances to offset large moral and economic debts - paid to Japanese Americans interned during World War Two, to families of Holocaust survivors and to Blacks in post-apartheid South Africa.But the United States has never made much headway in discussions of whether or how to compensate African Americans for more than 200 years of slavery and help make up for racial inequality.HR-40, a bill to fund the study of “slavery and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies” has been floated in Congress for more than 30 years, but never taken up for a full vote.Democratic Representative Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced it in January.Fellow Democratic Representative Steve Cohen, who chairs the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told a hearing on Wednesday it was fitting to consider HR-40 at a time when the country is reckoning with police violence against Blacks and a pandemic that has disproportionately affected African Americans.Biden told the Washington Post last year that “we must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery, and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear, and trauma wrought upon Black people in this country.”But like nearly all of the Democratic presidential candidates at the time, he did not embrace the idea of specific payments to enslaved people’s descendants, instead promising “major actions to address systemic racism” and further study.A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last June following the death in police custody in Minneapolis of George Floyd, an African-American man, found clear divisions along partisan and racial lines, with only one in 10 white respondents supporting the idea and half of Black respondents endorsing it.Calls have been growing from some politicians, academics and economists for such payments to be made to an estimated 40 million African Americans. Any federal reparations program could cost trillions of dollars, they estimate.Supporters say such payments would act as acknowledgement of the value of the forced, unpaid labor that supported the economy of Southern U.S. states until the Civil War ended slavery in 1865, the broken promise of land grants after the war and the burden of the century and a half of legal and de facto segregation that followed.",Reuters

U.S. officials have said the incident fit the profile of a strike by Iran-backed militia.“We’ll strike, if that’s what we think we need to do, at a time and place of our own choosing. We demand the right to protect our troops,” Austin said.Asked if Iran had been given a message that U.S. retaliation would not constitute an escalation, Austin said that Iran is fully capable of assessing the strike and U.S activities.“What they should draw from this, again, is that we’re going to defend our troops and our response will be thoughtful. It will be appropriate,” Austin said. “We would hope that they would choose to do the right things.”There were no reports of injuries among U.S. service personnel after the attack but an American civilian contractor died after suffering a “cardiac episode” while sheltering from the rockets, the Pentagon said.Iraqi officials said 10 rockets landed at the base but the Pentagon was more guarded, saying there were 10 “impacts.” It said the rockets appeared to have been fired from multiple sites east of the base, which also was targeted last year by a ballistic missile attack directly from Iran.U.S. forces carried out air strikes against facilities at a border control point in Syria used by Iranian-backed militias including Kata’ib Hezbollah and Kata’ib Sayyid al-Shuhada in February.",Reuters

He has won International Monetary Fund praise for his handling of the economy during the pandemic, and has negotiated a four-year IMF programme worth $1.3 billion, signalling confidence in Jordan’s reform agenda.The expected reshuffle comes after parliament last week passed a 9.9 billion dinar ($14 billion) budget which Al Ississ said aimed to maintain fiscal prudence to help ensure financial stability and rein in a record $45 billion public debt.The economy saw its worst contraction - 3% - in decades last year, hit by lockdowns, border closures and a sharp fall in tourism during the pandemic, but the government and the IMF both predict a bounce of similar magnitude this year.Officials say Jordan’s commitment to IMF reforms and investor confidence in the improved outlook helped the country maintain stable sovereign ratings at a time when other emerging markets were being downgraded.",Reuters

It is the worst political unrest in years in a country widely seen as one of West Africa’s most stable.Sonko, who enjoys strong support among the young, was arrested after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. Sonko denies the allegation and says it is politically motivated.Opponents of President Macky Sall have called for further protests on Monday.The education ministry “strongly recommends that students’ parents keep a close eye on their children and keep them from the risks that come from the protests,” it said in a statement.Much of Dakar turned into a war zone last week as police clashed with thousands of angry protesters. Many shops, gas stations and banks were closed for days. Large queues formed for petrol and groceries on Sunday, during what is expected to be a brief respite in the unrest.Political pressure has mounted on President Sall, whose presidency has been plagued by accusations that he unjustly torpedoes political rivals and worries that he may seek to extend his rule beyond his allotted two-term limit.The economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and a nightly curfew to contain its spread have only stoked frustrations.Pressure increased on Saturday after a 17-year-old boy was killed by gunfire in southern Senegal.The influential League of Imams and Preachers of Senegal on Sunday called for the release of Sonko and a “return to calm”.",Reuters

MAR 07 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-election-abbas-fatah/abbas-battles-fatah-party-discord-ahead-of-palestinian-elections-idUSKBN2AZ07T,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Facing elections for the first time in 15 years, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is battling a growing rift within his powerful Fatah party that poses a new threat to his dominance over Palestinian politics.A breakaway bid by one of Abbas’s party allies has intensified speculation he might cancel a presidential vote planned for July, fearing a potential challenge by Marwan Barghouti, a popular Palestinian leader jailed by Israel.Abbas’s office denies he has plans to delay or scrub the presidential vote.Barghouti, now 61, was a driving force in Palestinians’ 2000-2005 uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He was sentenced by an Israeli court in 2004 to life imprisonment after being convicted over multiple lethal attacks on Israelis by Palestinian militants. Barghouti has always denied the charges.Abbas, 85, has ruled the Palestinian Authority (PA) in self-rule areas of the West Bank by decree for over a decade. In January, he announced presidential and legislative ballots - a move largely seen as a response to domestic and Western criticism of his presidency’s democratic legitimacy.Adding to that criticism is Nasser al-Qudwa, a longtime member of Fatah’s top Central Committee who last week announced he was forming a new list that would run separately from Fatah in the legislative election, in May.“(Palestinians) are fed up with the current situation ... internal behaviour or misbehaviour, things like the absence of the rule of the law, the absence of equality, the absence of fairness,” Qudwa, a nephew of late Fatah founder and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, told Reuters.It is rare for leaders on the 19-member Central Committee members to publicly break with Abbas.Qudwa, 67, said he hoped his list would be led by Barghouti, a Fatah leader long floated as a potential Abbas successor.Barghouti has not said if he will join the list or run in the presidential ballot. He and his lawyer declined a request to interview him. But opinion polls suggest he would win comfortably against Abbas and leaders from Hamas, the Islamist movement that seized control of Gaza from Fatah in 2007.Aides to Abbas point to the split with Hamas as having contributed to the long delay in holding new elections.Abbas has tried to resolve the discord by dispatching a loyalist to visit Barghouti in prison and, through emissaries, preaching party unity after Qudwa announced his new list.“Fatah, with strength and power, will run united in the upcoming democratic elections to strengthen democracy, maintain the national liberation project and protect Palestinian national unity,” Hussein al-Sheikh, Abbas’ civil affairs minister, wrote on Facebook.Palestinian officials have privately questioned how Barghouti would contest the elections from prison and what would happen if he won. Any move to free him would likely ignite a political firestorm in Israel.Two Western diplomats told Reuters that European countries were urging Abbas not to backtrack on his election pledge.“There’s concern he (Abbas) might see a middle ground in allowing the legislative elections to go ahead, but postponing or cancelling the presidential election,” one of them said.Abbas is due on Monday to convene a meeting of Fatah’s Central Committee, where he is expected to formally sanction Qudwa.Qudwa told Reuters he does not plan to attend committee meetings.It was not immediately clear how much support Qudwa’s list would garner. About 250 Palestinians joined a Zoom conference call he held last week to announce the move.The Palestinians’ last parliamentary ballot, in 2006, resulted in a surprise victory by Fatah’s main rival Hamas. That created a rift that deepened when the Islamist group wrested military control of Gaza from the Fatah-led PA two years after Israel withdrew settlers and soldiers from the territory.The elections are part of a broader push for reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, seen as vital to building broad popular support for any future statehood talks with Israel, frozen since 2014.Party lists for the legislative ballot are due by March 20.",Reuters

If (the) motive was to kill them they should all be dead but there were those who did not resist arrest so they were collared,” Parlade told Reuters in a phone message.",Reuters

It hopes the pandemic can be contained by a vaccine programme that has already delivered a dose to nearly 22 million people, as well as regular testing.Many secondary schools and colleges had already started inviting students for their first “lateral flow” COVID-19 tests, which give rapid results, with nearly 1 million conducted last week, the government said.After three initial tests on site, students will be provided with two tests to use each week at home, it said, adding that nearly 57 million tests had been delivered to schools and colleges across the country.",Reuters

Ossoff and Warnock won in a political earthquake that resulted in Democrats seizing control of the Senate from the Republicans, who had held the chamber since 2015.Their unexpected twin victories came after President Joe Biden narrowly carried Georgia, a seismic change in a state that also elected hard-right Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had espoused the QAnon conspiracy theory.“Georgia is not a blue state,” Perdue wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. “It is imperative that Republicans regain the majority in the U.S. Senate in 2022.”The victories by Biden, Ossoff and Warnock followed a near-win of Georgia’s governorship by voting rights activist and former state legislator Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost to Republican Brian Kemp in 2018.The near victory gave Abrams a national profile. She has not yet said if she will run for governor again in 2022, but Kemp allies have launched a “Stop Stacey” group in anticipation.While Ossoff was elected to a full six-year term, Warnock was elected to serve the remainder of former Republican Senator Johnny Isakson’s term and will need to face the voters for another election in 2022.",Reuters

Its landslide November victory in national elections has been ignored by the junta.“No matter how the situation in Myanmar changes, China’s determination to promote China-Myanmar relations will not waver, and China’s direction of promoting China-Myanmar friendly cooperation will not change,” Wang said.On Saturday, an Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar’s junta told Reuters that the generals are keen to leave politics after their coup and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.Some of the protests against the coup, which have drawn hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, have taken place outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon, with protesters accusing Beijing of supporting the junta.Beijing has said it was not informed in advance of the coup.China has traditionally been viewed with suspicion in Myanmar, where it has significant economic and strategic interests and has often backed Myanmar’s position against Western criticism.",Reuters

We will stand with friends and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security and values in the Indo-Pacific region,” she said when asked about Wang’s remarks.Under Trump, the United States imposed sanctions against China and its officials over Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Beijing’s economic policies, which have not been lifted by Biden.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he agrees with his predecessor Mike Pompeo’s determination that genocide against Muslims is under way in Xinjiang.Activists and U.N. experts say 1 million Muslim Uighurs are held in Chinese camps. China denies abuses and says its camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.Wang said some Western politicians chose to believe lies about Xinjiang, and took a dig at Western countries’ records.“When it comes to ‘genocide’, most people think of North American Indians in the 16th century, African slaves in the 19th century, Jews in the 20th century, and the Australian aborigines who are still fighting today,” he said.“The so-called ‘genocide’ in Xinjiang is ridiculously absurd. It is a rumour with ulterior motives and a complete lie.”",Reuters

Ululations of joy rang out in the pauses between the songs. Nuns and priests danced.The excitement had been building far ahead of the pope’s arrival. Some in the crowd said they had been there for hours.Iraq’s Christian population of 1.5 million some 20 years ago now stands at 300,000, and many of those want to leave because they see few prospects in a country where Shi’ite militias and sleeper militant cells still pose a threat. Iraq has been torn by war since the U.S. invasion of 2003 and the Islamist militant violence that followed.The roads in and around Qaraqosh were sprinkled with checkpoints and armed officers.“We are very happy, but the moment he leaves everything will go back to normal.

Security has improved since the defeat of Islamic State in 2017, but Iraq continues to be a theatre for global and regional score-settling, especially a bitter U.S.-Iran rivalry that has played out on Iraqi soil.Sistani, 90, is one of the most influential figures in Shi’ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond, and their meeting was the first between a pope and such a senior Shi’ite cleric.The meeting took place at the humble home Sistani has rented for decades, near the golden-domed Imam Ali shrine in Najaf. Francis had to walk about 30 metres (yards) along an alleyway to get to it after leaving his car.The pope’s visit to Iraq has been intensely blanketed in security and the roads his convoy traveled along on Saturday were closed to other traffic. Pickup trucks mounted with machine guns and even tanks were stationed in some places along the routes.After the meeting, Sistani called on world religious leaders to hold great powers to account and for wisdom and sense to prevail over war. He added Christians should live like all Iraqis in peace and coexistence.Although Abraham is considered the father of Christians, Muslims and Jews, no Jewish representative was present at the inter-religious event in Ur.In 1947, a year before Israel’s birth, Iraq’s Jewish community numbered around 150,000. Now their numbers are in single figures.A local Church official said Jews were contacted and invited but the situation for them was “complicated” particularly as they have no structured community. However, in similar past events in predominantly Muslim countries, a senior foreign Jewish figure has attended.“Hostility, extremism and violence are not born of a religious heart: they are betrayals of religion,” the pope said at Ur. “We believers cannot be silent when terrorism abuses religion; indeed, we are called unambiguously to dispel all misunderstandings,” he said.Islamic State militants, who tried to establish a caliphate covering several countries, ravaged northern Iraq from 2014-2017, killing Christians as well as Muslims who opposed the insurgents.Iraq’s Christian community, one of the oldest in the world, has been particularly devastated, falling to about 300,000 from about 1.5 million before the U.S. invasion and the brutal Islamist militant violence that followed.‘A TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE’At Ur, Francis praised young Muslims for helping Christians repair their churches “when terrorism invaded the north of this beloved country”.Rafah Husein Baher, a member of the small, ancient Sabean Mandaean religion, thanked the pope for making the trip despite the many problems in the country, which include a surge in COVID-19 cases and a recent spate of rocket and suicide bomb attacks.“Your visit means a triumph of virtue, it is a symbol of appreciation to Iraqis, Blessed is he who uproots fear from souls.”Later, in a homily at a Saturday evening service at Baghdad’s Chaldean Cathedral of Saint Joseph, Francis again paid tribute to “those of our brothers and sisters who here too have suffered prejudice and indignities, mistreatment and persecutions for the name of Jesus”.Coronavirus restrictions limited the number of people allowed in the church to about 100, but they included the country’s president, foreign minister and the speaker of the house of parliament, all of whom are Muslim.The pope, whose visit to Iraq began on Friday, travels on Sunday north to Mosul, a former Islamic State stronghold, where churches and other buildings still bear the scars of conflict.",Reuters

It was not immediately clear if Blinken will also visit India.The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi referred a request for comment to the Defense Department, which could not be reached outside regular business hours.For India, closer bilateral military ties could bring greater access to American technology, as New Delhi tries to modernise its defence system amid tensions with neighbouring China in the western Himalayas.India and China last month began to pull back troops and battle tanks from a bitterly contested lake area high in the Himalayas, in a breakthrough after a months-long standoff on the disputed border between the two nuclear-armed giants.The standoff began in April when India said Chinese troops had intruded deep into its side of the Line of Actual Control or the de facto border in the Ladakh area in the western Himalayas.U.S. defence manufacturers hope closer ties will boost their own prospects in India, which is one of the world’s biggest defence spenders but still has major gaps in its military capabilities.",Reuters

Thai courts have denied recent requests for bail for some of the jailed protest leaders.“Release our friends,” shouted the protesters in unison, as they gathered in front of a criminal court, which was surrounded by barbed wire. A water cannon truck could be seen behind the gates of the court.“Abolish 112,” they also said, referring to Thailand’s lese majeste law, or Article 112 in the Thai criminal code, which prohibits anyone from insulting or defaming the king.A few protesters burned photographs of the king at the rally. Separate groups also led two other protests at other locations in Bangkok.Earlier on Saturday, police warned protesters that they risked being arrested and that police might use harsher measures if protesters became unruly.“Protests are illegal. Anyone who joins or invites others to join is breaking the law,” Piya Tavichai, deputy commissioner of Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau, told a news conference.Police used rubber bullets for the first time last Sunday, as well as tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters. Ten protesters and 26 police were injured.In a podcast on Saturday morning, the prime minister urged Thais to respect the law and avoid conflict.“We have to love each other and be united, not divided, and respect the law,” said Prayuth, who first came to power after leading a military coup in 2014.The Royal Palace has declined to directly comment on the protests, but Prayuth and government officials have said that criticism of the king is unlawful and inappropriate.",Reuters

Even those opposed to the conviction, like Senate Minority Leader (Mitch) McConnell, believe Donald Trump was guilty of a ‘disgraceful dereliction of duty’ and ‘practically and morally responsible for provoking’ the violence unleashed on the Capitol,” Biden said.He said he was thinking about Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was killed during the siege of the Capitol on Jan. 6, others who bravely stood guard, and those who lost their lives.He lauded the courage of those who made efforts to protect the integrity of U.S. democracy, including Democrats and Republicans, election officials and judges, elected representatives and poll workers.“This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile. That it must always be defended. That we must be ever vigilant. That violence and extremism has no place in America.

The tally fell short of the two-thirds needed to secure conviction.North Carolina Republican Chairman Michael Whatley condemned Burr for voting against the former president, as a “shocking and disappointing” abdication of his duty to voters.Burr, who said last week there was “compelling” evidence that President Trump was guilty of inciting an insurrection, said after the committee vote that it was a “sad day” for North Carolina Republicans.“My party’s leadership has chosen loyalty to one man over the core principles of the Republican Party and the founders of our great nation,” he said.Louisiana’s Republican Party voted on Saturday to censure Senator Bill Cassidy for voting to convict Trump. The party’s leader in Pennsylvania, Lawrence Tabas, has publicly criticized Senator Pat Toomey for voting to convict.The other four Republicans who voted to convict were Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse.The Republican Party faces internal conflict since Trump left office on Jan. 20, with many officials remaining publicly loyal to Trump and his devoted base of voters, while others including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have publicly criticized the former president.McConnell said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Monday there was no question Trump “bears moral responsibility. His supporters stormed the Capitol because of the unhinged falsehoods he shouted into the world’s largest megaphone. His behavior during and after the chaos was also unconscionable.”",Reuters

Biden will deliver remarks at a virtual gathering of the Munich security forum here on Feb. 19.After years of Trump’s public ridiculing of NATO allies such as Germany who failed to reach defense spending targets, Biden’s Pentagon will, without abandoning those targets, focus on progress made toward bolstering NATO’s collective defense, officials said.“Trust is something that can’t be built overnight, is something that takes time. It takes more than words. It takes action,” said a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s objectives for the NATO meeting.To underscore Biden's views on NATO, the White House even took the rare step of releasing a video youtu.be/o9E1S3UPRFY on Jan. 27 of the U.S. president's first conversation with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in which he used the word ""sacred"" to describe the U.S. commitment to collective defense.Still, Biden could face an uphill battle in Europe, which saw Washington upend its commitments under Trump, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.Trump’s portrayal of NATO as an organization in crisis, dragged down by laggard members, has left many European allies feeling worn down.“There’s an exhaustion in European security circles from Trump and his unpredictability,” said a European NATO diplomat.“We’ve just spent four years not talking to each other and the world is very different from four years ago. Biden needs to do a big repair job in Europe.”Portugal’s Defence Minister Joao Gomes Cravinho, underscoring wariness about the United States, told the European Parliament on Jan. 28 that the Trump years were an “ideological experiment” that had “devastating effects in terms of the credibility of the United States and its strength internationally.”The deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in which pro-Trump followers tried to keep him in power, has also done severe damage to America’s global image as a beacon of democracy, political analysts said.One of Biden’s biggest challenges will be convincing allies there won’t be a return to another Trump era, or something akin to it, perhaps four or eight years down the line.“That’s a legitimate fear and a legitimate concern,” said Rachel Rizzo, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security focusing on European security and NATO.She added it will be a “slow process” to prove the United States can be a reliable ally.French President Emmanuel Macron has gone so far as to say Europe needs its own sovereign defense strategy, independent of the United States here. Still, eastern European allies such as Poland – fearful of Russia - say European defense plans should only complement NATO, not replace it.The NATO defense ministerial is expected to broach a range of issues, including efforts to end the two-decade-old war in Afghanistan.The ministerial is also expected to include discussion of the so-called “2 percent target” which requires NATO members spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024.Germany, Italy and Spain will all miss the 2024 target, according to initial projections released by NATO in October. Germany has pledged to reach the NATO spending target by 2031, and its failure angered Trump, who ordered a pullout of some 12,000 troops from Germany, declaring: “We don’t want to be the suckers any more.”Asked about the target, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said he expected Austin to emphasize that many allies were meeting the target and others were “striving to get there.”“I think you’ll see a supportive message from the secretary about how relevant NATO is,” said Kirby, a retired Navy admiral.Another U.S. official said that even with economic stress on budgets because of COVID-19, the expectation was still for allies to hit 2 percent of their GDP, with Washington likely to make the argument that the health crisis should not be allowed to turn into a security crisis.“But you’ll hear a substantially different tone and a lot more emphasis on different capabilities,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.“It won’t be instrumentalized as a political weapon to beat up allies.”",Reuters

It did not give details of how much work the firm would do, but the sum is very small by the standards of consulting firm costs.An Italian official told Reuters that McKinsey was willing to work pro bono but the government insisted that they have at least expenses paid.A representative for McKinsey had no comments.Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank with no political affiliation, took office last month after the collapse of the previous coalition. A first priority is to redraft Italy’s Recovery Plan, which must be handed to the European Commission by April to tap more than 200 billion euros of EU funds and revive the pandemic-hit economy.With time running out, the Economy Ministry said in a statement that it had asked McKinsey to assess the plans already prepared by the other EU countries and to provide “support for monitoring the finalization of the (Italian) Plan”.News about the contract was leaked by Italian Radio Popolare on Friday and sparked criticism on Twitter from lawmakers of Draghi’s coalition, which includes parties from the left to right.“Any changes to the Recovery Plan governance must be told and explained to the parliament,” tweeted former deputy Economy Minister Antonio Misiani, a lawmaker from the ruling Democratic Party (PD).Stefano Fassina, a deputy for the LEU party, called the move “humiliating” for administration civil servants and said it removed political accountability.Another PD lawmaker, former minister for the Regions Francesco Boccia, told Reuters that given McKinsey’s role helping multinational firms define their investment strategies, “it would not be free of conflict of interests in advising the Italian state on strategic public policy decisions”.The Economy Ministry said in its statement that every decision regarding the Recovery Plan remained with the competent public administrations.The European Commission will disburse the money in installments dependent on the government reaching milestones and meeting benchmarks.($1 = 0.8391 euros)",Reuters

Rio de Janeiro, meanwhile, adopted new restrictions, including a nighttime curfew.“We’ve reached a grave moment of the pandemic. The coronavirus variants are hitting us aggressively,” Brazil’s Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said on social media.The divergence of the region’s urban nighttime revelers illustrates the different trajectories Argentina and Brazil are on in the race to tame COVID-19, even as inoculation programs are hit by delays.Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has long sought to diminish the gravity of the virus, while Argentina’s President Alberto Fernandez has taken a tougher stance.Claudio Mendez, Argentina manager for cinema chain operator Cinepolis, said that as vaccines were rolled out they hoped cinemas could return to normal after what had been an incredibly a tough year.“It was a situation not imaginable even in the worst horror movie,” he said. “We believe as the vaccination process advances ... film premieres will begin to flow more normally.”Back at the Colón Theater, many musicians still played with their masks on, while wind instrument players were inside transparent cubicles to avoid the potential spread of the virus. The audience was temperature checked and seating was spread out.“We needed to go back and today was the day,” said María Victoria Alcaraz, the opera house’s general director. “The spirit was to reopen the doors as soon as possible so that the public and the artists could come together one again.”",Reuters

The U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan proposed a shakeup of the stalled peace process this week, including an interim government and a conference of key players, according to diplomatic and political sources, but his plan faced immediate objections by the warring sides.Afghan-born U.S. diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad is on a visit to Kabul, Doha and other regional capitals, his first since U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration began reviewing its options for the peace process and as time runs out before a May 1 U.S. troop withdrawal deadline.With peace negotiations in the Qatari capital making little progress and violence in Afghanistan escalating, Khalilzad is trying to build consensus around alternative options with all Afghan sides and key regional players, sources said.“(The United States) thinks Doha isn’t working and needs impetus and an alternate approach,” said one diplomatic source who closely follows the process.In Kabul, Khalilzad met Abdullah Abdullah, the chief peace envoy, President Ashraf Ghani and other political and civil society leaders, including former President Hamid Karzai.Three diplomatic sources, two sources on the teams of political leaders who met with Khalilzad and two international sources in Kabul said one of the envoy’s main proposals was an interim government arrangement, referred to as a participatory or representative government.A former Afghan government official familiar with the matter said Khalilzad shared a document detailing the power-sharing proposal and that it revised a paper he circulated in December.Another proposal was a meeting with a similar format to the 2001 Bonn conference, to involve representatives from a wide range of Afghan parties meeting in person while international agencies and diplomats push them to a solution.Anti-Taliban leaders met under international auspices in the German city of Bonn after the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ousted the insurgents from power and agreed on a provisional administration and a roadmap for forming a permanent government and writing a new constitution.“We’re considering a number of different ideas that might accelerate the process,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Friday.“The United States is not making any formal proposals and is continuing to review all relevant options for future force posture - and all means all,” a State Department spokesperson said on Saturday. “Ambassador Khalilzad has discussed a range of ways to move the diplomacy forward, nothing more.”The two international sources said Khalilzad is asking the United Nations to take a lead role and call the conference.Spokespeople for the U.N. mission in Afghanistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Two of the sources said the conference could be held in Turkey, but a third cautioned that location might meet resistance from Western nations and other countries including Germany and Uzbekistan were being considered.Khalilzad’s plans immediately encountered objections from both the Afghan government and the Taliban.Ghani made a fiery speech in Afghanistan’s parliament on Saturday, repeating his refusal to step aside for an interim government. “Any institution can write a fantasy on a piece of paper and suggest a solution for Afghanistan” he said, warning any transfer of power would have to take place through elections as required by the constitution.Two international officials in Kabul said Ghani’s fierce opposition would be a problem for the plan.“The problem here is that Ghani can blame the United States directly ... by challenging his legitimacy and considering an interim government it implies they are undermining the democratic process,” one of the officials said.A Taliban leader in Doha who spoke on condition of anonymity said Khalilzad raised the possibility of an interim government and a conference with the insurgents’ negotiating team, as well as asking for a ceasefire or reduction in violence by 60-70%.“Khalilzad has come with some ideas and his top agenda is the intra-Afghan dialogue to deliver some tangible results and very soon,” he said.He said the Taliban would not join an interim government, but was not opposed to one being formed.“We would recommend people with a good reputation for the interim government and this set up would need to work for at least two years to depoliticise all the government departments, including the security establishment,” he said.They could consider the reduction in violence, but not a ceasefire, the Taliban leader said, and had asked Khalilzad to pressure the Afghan government to release 7,000 more Taliban prisoners.“We don’t believe any other conference in any country would help resolve the Afghan conflict,” he said.Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said they had not yet seen the plan, but if an alternative to talks in Qatar was sought, “it is doomed to failure.”Two sources said Khalilzad was expected to visit Islamabad, Pakistan, a key player in the peace process, on his trip.The envoy was the architect under President Donald Trump’s administration of a February 2020 deal between Washington and the Taliban, which envisaged the Afghan government and Taliban negotiating a peace agreement and setting a final withdrawal of foreign forces by May 1.",Reuters

Around 50 demonstrators burnt tyres in Martyrs’ Square in central Beirut.Lebanon’s financial crisis, which erupted in 2019, has wiped out jobs, raised warnings of growing hunger and locked people out of their bank deposits. A new cabinet could implement reforms needed to trigger billions of dollars of international aid.The country has been rudderless since August when Diab’s cabinet resigned on the back of the Beirut port explosion that devastated swathes of the capital.Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri was nominated in October but has failed to form a new cabinet due to the political deadlock between him and President Michel Aoun.“If seclusion helps with cabinet formation then I am ready to resort to it, although it goes against my convictions for it disrupts the entire state and is detrimental to the Lebanese,” Diab said in a televised speech.The collapse of the Lebanese pound, to 10,000 to the dollar on Tuesday, was the last straw for many who have seen prices of consumer goods such as diapers and cereals nearly triple since the financial crisis erupted.“Doesn’t the scramble for milk constitute a sufficient incentive to transcend formalities and roughen out the edges in order to form a government?” Diab said, referring to a recent Beirut supermarket incident in which shoppers fought over powdered milk.A video of the squabble went viral on social media, underscoring the desperate state of the economy.“Social conditions are aggravating, financial conditions are putting a severe strain on the country, political conditions are increasingly complex,” Diab added in his speech.“The country is confronted with enormous challenges that a normal government cannot face without political consensus so how can a caretaker government face these challenges?”",Reuters

Protesters also burned down a military police station and ransacked several government buildings, the official said.At least five people have died in protests sparked by Wednesday’s arrest of Ousmane Sonko, Senegal’s most prominent opposition leader. It is the worst political unrest in years for a country widely seen as one of West Africa’s most stable.A spokesman for Senegal’s military police confirmed one person had died during clashes in Diaobe but did not say under what circumstances. He said protesters ransacked six police stations across the country on Saturday.Sonko, who finished third in the 2019 presidential election, was arrested after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. Sonko denies the allegation and says it is an attempt by Sall to kneecap a political rival.The government denies this.The mostly young protesters cited a range of other grievances too, including high unemployment and strict measures to control the coronavirus that have inflicted economic pain, especially on informal workers.Many are especially dubious about the accusation against Sonko because two other top rivals of Sall were previously targeted by criminal charges that prevented them from running for president in 2019.In a statement, the opposition Movement to Defend Democracy (M2D) coalition called for three days of nationwide protests beginning on Monday.“M2D ... calls on the Senegalese people to pursue its mobilisation and peaceful struggle by using all of its constitutional rights to reject the dictatorship of Macky Sall,” it said.",Reuters

They are unable to see the pain of the farmers,” said Amarjeet Singh, a 68-year-old farmer from Punjab state. “They have left us no option but to protest.”Tens of thousands of farmers from several north Indian states have been camped out on the outskirts of the capital in bitter cold since December demanding that the laws be repealed.Their movement has gained international attention and support, including from celebrities such as climate activist Greta Thunberg and U.S. singer Rihanna, but several rounds of negotiations between farmer leaders and the government have failed.Modi’s government has lashed out at supporters of the protests and stands accused by rights activists of using heavy-handed tactics to curb the protests.While the protests have been mostly peaceful, a brief spate of violence on Jan. 26 led to the death of a protestor, and the police have filed criminal charges against eight journalists over alleged misreporting on the events of the day.“The Indian authorities’ response to protests has focused on discrediting peaceful protesters, harassing critics of the government, and prosecuting those reporting on the events,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement last month.As the capital braces for harsh summers and the harvesting season begins, farmers gathering on Saturday said they had no plans to turn back until their demands were met.“Bitter cold didn’t affect our movement, and neither will deathly heat,” said Raja Singh, a 58-year-old farmer from Punjab state.",Reuters

Egypt and Sudan’s positions have drawn closer as Cairo has engaged in a flurry of diplomacy over the issue in the past two years.This week Egypt’s chief of staff signed a military cooperation agreement with his Sudanese counterpart during a visit to Sudan.“We affirmed the necessity of returning to serious and effective negotiations with the aim of reaching, as soon as possible and before the next flood season, a just, balanced and legally binding agreement,” Sisi said after meeting Sudan’s leaders.Sudan recently proposed that the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union should actively mediate in the dispute, rather than simply observing talks, a suggestion that Egypt supports.Ethiopia this week indicated its opposition to adding mediators to an existing African Union-led process.Sisi’s call came a day after Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a return to “serious” negotiations over the dam, according to Egypt’s foreign ministry.Meeting with the head of Sudan’s ruling council, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sisi also discussed “recent Sudanese moves to extend state sovereignty on its eastern borders with Ethiopia, which come within the context of Sudan’s respect for international agreements”, a statement from Egypt’s presidency said.Sudan and Ethiopia have blamed each other over unrest in the border area of Al-Fashqa, long settled by Ethiopian farmers. Ethiopia has rejected Sudan’s claims to be asserting its rights to control the area under a border agreement from 1903.Since Bashir was toppled following mass protests, a military-civilian council has held power in Sudan under a political transition expected to last until the end of 2023.",Reuters

335,"Biden to bring in asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under Trump program
The U.S. government next week will begin to gradually process thousands of asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under a controversial program put in place by former President Donald Trump, officials said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-immigration-asylum/biden-to-bring-in-asylum-seekers-forced-to-wait-in-mexico-under-trump-program-idUSKBN2AC113,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government next week will begin to gradually process thousands of asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under a controversial program put in place by former President Donald Trump, officials said.The moves are part of a plan by the administration of President Joe Biden to end the program, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), an effort complicated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and concerns over illegal immigration.The Trump administration launched the program in 2019 as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on the ability to seek asylum in the United States, which Trump officials depicted as rife with fraud and meritless claims.The initiative forced more than 65,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers back across the border to wait for their U.S. court hearings, although far fewer are believed to still be waiting in Mexico.The Biden administration will begin by working to process about 25,000 migrants with active claims in the program, officials said on Thursday. The new guidelines will require migrants to register online or via phone, be tested for the coronavirus in Mexico and then come to a U.S. port of entry on a specific day.The news was welcomed with relief in a sprawling migrant camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, just across the border from Brownsville, Texas.“I’ve been reading all the articles,” said Salvadoran asylum seeker Sandra Andrade, who has been waiting in Mexico for over a year to resolve her U.S. court case. “Honestly, I have no words for how I’m feeling right now!”Biden vowed on the campaign trail to roll back restrictive Trump-era immigration policies, including MPP, which is informally known as “remain in Mexico.” His administration suspended new entries into the program when he took office on Jan. 20, but did not immediately put forward a plan to bring the people enrolled in it into the United States. Some have been waiting for as long as two years.Republicans embracing Trump’s hardline immigration views have criticized the ending of MPP and could use it as fuel for political attacks if illegal border crossings increase on Biden’s watch.Top Biden officials have stressed in recent weeks that migrants should not attempt to enter the United States, saying they need time to build up the capacity to process more asylum seekers.“Individuals who are not eligible under this initial phase should wait for further instructions and not travel to the border,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement accompanying the MPP announcement. “Due to the current pandemic, restrictions at the border remain in place and will be enforced.”Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador echoed that message on Friday, saying migrants should not think “the gates of the northern border are open” or believe human smugglers who say as much.During a call with reporters on Thursday evening, three Biden administration officials described the plans to process MPP enrollees, with the first phase beginning on Feb. 19.The officials, all of whom requested anonymity, only outlined procedures for people with active cases in U.S. immigration courts. Those with non-active cases, many of whom may have returned to their home countries, “will have other opportunities,” one of the officials said.Under the plan, migrants will need to register with international organizations over the internet or by phone and await instructions. One of the organizations will also handle coronavirus testing in Mexico, another official said.Biden officials declined to identify the organizations on Thursday. However, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said the refugee agency would work with both the U.S. and Mexican governments to ensure migrants in the program could safely enter the United States.The migrants’ claims will initially be heard at three ports of entry along the border, with organizations working to identify those in line the longest and those deemed particularly vulnerable.At two of the ports, the Biden administration expects to process 300 people per day at each port. The effort will expand to additional ports over time.“We will start small,” said one of the officials.The Biden officials declined to name the ports where the administration planned to begin processing, citing concerns that people would rush to those locations.Migrants entering the United States through the program will not be placed in detention centers, but could be subject to an alternative form of monitoring, including ankle bracelets.The United States developed the strategy in close coordination with Mexican authorities, the official said.Even while Biden moves to end one Trump program, he faces growing pressure from advocates to end another known as Title 42. The pandemic-era order allows U.S. authorities to rapidly expel to Mexico migrants caught crossing the border illegally, a practice advocates say bypasses due process.The Biden administration has not said whether it will end that program. More than 400,000 migrants have been expelled under the measure since it became effective in March 2020, although many of those caught are repeat border crossers and therefore counted multiple times.The effort to process MPP enrollees comes as arrests of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border have been increasing after a steep drop at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.",Reuters

The evidence suggests that Caldwell “engaged in planning and communications with others ... to plan a potential military-like incursion on the Capitol,” Mehta said.Followers of then president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol to disrupt the certification by lawmakers of Joe Biden’s election victory after months of Trump making unsubstantiated claims the vote was fraudulent. The riots led to five deaths, including a police officer. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on a charge of inciting an insurrection and is being tried in the Senate.In court on Friday, Caldwell grew agitated as Mehta discussed his ruling and read aloud snippets of texts and other evidence prosecutors had gathered against him, and interrupted the proceeding to object that things were taken out of context.“Anything you say on this record could be used against you,” Mehta reminded him.In court filings this week, prosecutors said the FBI had found a document entitled “Death List” during a search of Caldwell’s home with the hand-written name of an election official in another state.Prosecutors declined to identify the name of the election official in open court on Friday, except to say the official had received some publicity because of the 2020 presidential election and is not from Caldwell’s home state of Virginia.The Justice Department has said it has evidence of extensive planning by Caldwell, Watkins and Crowl ahead of the Jan. 6 riots, including a plot to stage an armed “quick reaction force” outside of Washington that would be ready to swoop in and fight “hand to hand” if ordered by Trump.The judge also said he found it “astonishing” that Caldwell allegedly exchanged messages with an associate of another militia group called the “Three Percenters” to discuss the idea of transporting weapons across the Potomac River.Caldwell’s attorney denied his client is a member of the Oath Keepers or that he ever actually entered the U.S. Capitol building itself, citing physical ailments that would have prevented him from doing so.Prosecutors on Friday acknowledged they don’t have evidence Caldwell is a “dues-paying” member, but said he nevertheless has strong ties to the group.",Reuters

He is the first to acknowledge this is not the standard of behavior set out by the President.”Ducklo, McCammond and Palmeri did not respond to emails seeking comment. An Axios spokeswoman said McCammond disclosed the relationship to her editors in November and was reassigned from a beat covering the White House.The suspension comes after Democratic President Joe Biden, who took office last month, vowed to take a hard line on any incivility among members of his administration.“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot ... no ifs, ands or buts,” Biden told political appointees during a virtual swearing-in ceremony. “Everybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity.”Psaki told reporters during a briefing on Friday that Biden was not involved in the decision to suspend Ducklo and stressed that the White House took the matter seriously.Ducklo’s behavior was “completely unacceptable. He knows that,” Psaki said. “We’ve had conversations with him. ... This will never happen again.”",Reuters

Cerciello’s badge was not found at the crime scene.Elder and Natale-Hjorth were in Rome on holiday at the time and had tried to buy drugs from a local dealer. They have told the court that they were cheated, but managed to snatch a bag off an intermediary as he tried to get away.They subsequently agreed to meet the dealer again to get their money back in exchange for the bag, but instead the two policemen showed up. Neither man was in uniform and Elder has testified that they immediately attacked them, forcing him and Natale-Hjorth to defend themselves.“I panicked and believed he wanted to kill me,” Italian media quoted Elder as telling the court earlier this month.Police say Cerciello, 35, was unarmed at the time and was stabbed 11 times by Elder with an 18-cm (7-inch) blade.Italian media have reported that the dealer was an informer who had reported the theft of the bag, asking the police to intervene.In a court appearance last September, Elder apologised for the killing.Natale-Hjorth initially told police he had not been involved in the killing and did not know his friend had a knife.

There were no reports of casualties.More than 50 protesters have been killed since the coup, according to the United Nations - at least 38 on Wednesday alone. Protesters demand the release of Suu Kyi and the respect of November’s election, which her party won in landslide, but which the army rejected.“How much more can we allow the Myanmar military to get away with?” Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener told a closed meeting of the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Friday, according to a copy of her remarks reviewed by Reuters.“It is critical that this council is resolute and coherent in putting the security forces on notice and standing with the people of Myanmar firmly, in support of the clear November election results.”A junta spokesman did not answer calls requesting comment.The army says it has been restrained in stopping the protests, but has said it will not allow them to threaten stability.Several hundred people gathered in Sydney on Saturday to protest against the coup, singing and holding up three fingers, a salute that has come to symbolise solidarity and resistance across Myanmar.“We would like to urge the Australian government to work closely with the U.S., UK and EU governments and take strong action against these Myanmar military dictators,” said protest organiser Thein Moe Win.In Myanmar’s southern town of Dawei, protesters chanted “Democracy is our cause” and “The revolution must prevail”.People have taken to Myanmar’s streets in their hundreds of thousands at times, vowing to continue action in a country that spent nearly half a century under military rule until democratic reforms in 2011 that were cut short by the coup.“Political hope has begun to shine. We can’t lose the momentum of the revolution,” one protest leader, Ei Thinzar Maung, wrote on Facebook. “Those who dare to fight will have victory. We deserve victory.”On Friday night, authorities disturbed the grave of a 19-year-old woman who became an icon of the protest movement after she was shot dead wearing a T-shirt that read “Everything will be OK”, a witness and local media said.One witness said the body of Kyal Sin, widely known as Angel, was removed on Friday, examined and returned, before the tomb was re-sealed in Myanmar’s second city of Mandalay. The independent Mizzima news service also reported the event.A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.The killing of protesters has drawn international outrage.“Use of violence against the people of Myanmar must stop now,” South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a tweet, calling for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees and for the restoration of democracy.The United States and some other Western countries have imposed limited sanctions on the junta and the independent U.N. human rights investigator on Myanmar, Thomas Andrews, has called for a global arms embargo and targeted economic sanctions.The army took power over allegations of fraud in last year’s election which had been dismissed by the electoral commission. It has promised to hold a new election at an unspecified date.That plan is rejected by protesters and by a group representing lawmakers elected at the last election that has begun to issue statements in the name of a rival civilian administration.On Friday, it listed four demands - the end of the junta, the release of the detainees, democracy and the abolition of the 2008 constitution which left significant political representation and control in the hands of the military.A civil disobedience campaign of strikes running parallel with the protests has been supported by many government workers including a trickle of policemen.Authorities in Myanmar have asked India to return eight policemen who sought refuge across the border to avoid taking orders from the junta, an official in northeast India said on Saturday.India’s foreign ministry responded to a request for comment by referring to a statement given at a media briefing on Friday which said the ministry was still “ascertaining the facts.”",Reuters
344,"Lobbyist says Myanmar junta wants to improve relations with the West, spurn China
An Israeli-Canadian lobbyist hired by Myanmar's junta said on Saturday that the generals are keen to leave politics after their coup and seek to improve relations with the United States and distance themselves from China.

A U.S. State Department official declined to comment.Ben-Menashe said he was speaking from South Korea after a visit to Myanmar’s capital Naypyidaw, where he signed an agreement with the junta’s defense minister, General Mya Tun Oo. He said he would be paid an undisclosed fee if sanctions on the military are lifted.A spokesman for the military government did not answer calls seeking comment on Saturday.Ben-Menashe said he had been tasked with contacting Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to get their support for a plan to repatriate the Rohingya, a Muslim minority. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled military assaults in 2016 and 2017 in which soldiers killed indiscriminately, raped women and torched houses, according to a U.N. fact-finding mission.“It’s basically trying to get them some funding for the return of what they call the Bengalis,” said Ben-Menashe, using a term some in Myanmar use for the Rohingya to imply they are not from the country.Hundreds of thousands of people have protested in almost every town and city in Myanmar for weeks demanding the release of Suu Kyi and respect for the results of November’s election, which the military says was marred by fraud.Ben-Menashe said the junta could prove the vote was rigged, and that ethnic minorities were blocked from voting, but provided no evidence. Election observers have said there were no major irregularities.He said that on his two visits to the country since the coup, “disturbances weren’t that widespread” and the protest movement was not supported by most Myanmar people.Ben-Menashe said police were handling protests, not the military, despite photos and video footage of armed soldiers at the demonstrations. He argued that the military was best placed to oversee a return to democracy after the coup it staged.“They want to get out of politics completely,” he said, “but it’s a process.”",Reuters

Zuali said on Saturday that she was “waiting for the direction” from the India’s Ministry for Home Affairs in New Delhi.Although there have been instances recounted on social media of police joining the civil disobedience movement and protests against the junta, this is the first reported case of police fleeing Myanmar.In the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Myanmar authorities said they had information on eight police personnel who had crossed into India. The letter listed details for four police, aged between 22 and 25 years, including a female officer.“In order to uphold friendly relations between the two neighbour countries, you are kindly requested to detain 8 Myanmar police personnel who had arrived to Indian territories and hand-over to Myanmar,” the letter said.India’s federal home ministry did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.

She has become an icon of the protest movement.The exhumation of Kyal Sin has brought fresh outrage from opponents of the coup, who accuse the junta of trying to conceal the fact she was killed by their forces.State television said police, a judge and doctors had exhumed the body and carried out a surgical investigation.They found a penetration wound in the back of the head and a piece of lead measuring 1.2 cm by 0.7 cm in the brain and said that it was different from the tips of bullets used by the police.State television said police had been face-to-face with the protesters and the wound was at the back of the head and that the object which killed Kyal Sin could be fired from a gun able to shoot .38 calibre bullets.“Therefore, it can be assumed that those who do not want stability conducted the assassination,” MRTV said.On social media, coup opponents described the exhumation as a further insult to Kyal Sin and her family, with the intention of giving a false account of what happened.A military spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.State television said authorities had asked for the family’s permission to exhume the body, but did not say whether it was granted. Reuters was unable to contact the family.Protesters at the scene of the demonstration in Mandalay on Wednesday said they had come under fire from live bullets at the time Kyal Sin was killed.Pictures published by Reuters show that Kyal Sin had the back of her head turned towards the line of security forces in the moments before she was killed.Residents said Kyal Sin’s body had been exhumed on Friday by a team who arrived under police and military guard and kept people away from the grave site. The tomb was sealed with fresh cement and discarded rubber boots and gloves and plastic surgical gowns littered the site on Saturday.Kyal Sin was among at least 38 people killed on Wednesday, the bloodiest day so far in attempts by security forces to stop protests against the coup that has prompted daily demonstrations for over a month.The army says it has been restrained in the use of force, but that it will not allow protests to threaten stability.The army said it overthrew and detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi after the electoral commission rejected its allegations of fraud in an election in November that her party had won by a landslide.Protesters reject the army’s promise of new elections and demand the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees.",Reuters

This is about as busy as you‘ll get for weather across the country,” Chenard said on Friday.Bitter cold was already gripping the Plains on Friday, just a day after winter weather battered the United Statesfrom coast to coast, including freezing rain as far south as Fort Worth, Texas, where six people died in a multi-vehicle pileup.Temperatures as low as minus 45 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 43 Celsius) gripped Montana and Minnesota as cities such as Bismarck, North Dakota, shivered at minus 26 F (minus 32 C).“North Dakota is all fun and games until you have to be working in negative 40 degree weather,” @BricFlare wrote in a Twitter post.The Plains states will see significant snowfalls of 6 or more inches and freezing rain from Sunday into Monday, the weather service’s Chenard said, with the threat of freezing rain as far south as Houston and Louisiana.In the U.S. Northwest, snow and freezing rain blasting Portland, Oregon, and Seattle on Friday was expected to linger into Saturday.By Saturday night, freezing rain was expected in areas around the nation’s capital, including Virginia and Maryland, Chenard said.A wintry mix was expected to pelt the Northeast, where accumulations were expected to be minimal, although any slickness on roadways heightens travel risks.“It shouldn’t account for too much, but if it’s freezing rain, that can cause issues even if it’s light,” Chenard said.",Reuters
349,Delay in U.S. census data could muddle 2022 congressional elections,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-census/delay-in-u-s-census-data-could-muddle-2022-congressional-elections-idUSKBN2AC2G1,"(Reuters) - U.S. census data used once a decade to redraw legislative districts will not be made available until September, officials said on Friday, a delay that could make it difficult for states to finish new maps in time for the 2022 congressional elections.In announcing a new release date of Sept. 30, the Census Bureau cited lingering delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the bureau to shut down many of its data collection operations last spring as lockdowns swept the country.The bureau had previously set a target of July, which was already months later than the data is typically provided to states.Every 10 years, states employ the fresh census data to draw the lines for members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as thousands of state legislative offices.Some good-government groups have expressed concern that the compressed timeline could make it easier for lawmakers to engage in gerrymandering, the process by which maps are deliberately skewed to benefit one political party over another.If new maps are drawn late in 2021, that would leave little time for legal challenges to work their way through the courts before filing deadlines for elections. In Illinois and Texas, two states where one party holds unilateral power to redraw legislative boundaries, candidates must file before year’s end to run for office in 2022.“You’re starting to bump redistricting up against the election cycle,” said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. “There’s less time to challenge maps. That puts a lot of pressure on civil rights groups.”The only two states that have legislative elections in 2021, Virginia and New Jersey, will be forced to use existing maps as a result of the postponement.“This was a census like no other,” Kathleen Styles, a Census Bureau official, said on a call with reporters on Friday. “COVID-19 was definitely the driving factor in our schedule here.”The state-level population figures that determine whether states will gain or lose U.S. House seats will be available in April, but the more specific data needed to draw maps will be delayed.Democrats hold a slim 10-seat majority in the House, and some analysts have said that a combination of reapportionment and gerrymandering could be enough to swing the majority. Texas and Florida, two states that are controlled by Republicans and have seen aggressive gerrymanders in previous cycles, are expected to gain three seats and two seats, respectively.A Brennan Center analysis issued on Thursday found that Republicans would have sole control over the drawing of 181 congressional seats, compared with only 49 for Democrats.The delay also may force states to pass legislation extending redistricting deadlines or turn to the courts to seek extensions. Half of U.S. states have either a constitutional or statutory deadline calling for new maps in 2021, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",Reuters

Hong Kong representatives, in Beijing for an annual session, say the change is necessary and desirable.“Many people in Hong Kong are politically immature,” Liao, who sits on both Hong Kong’s and China’s legislature, said in a telephone interview.“They think ‘one man one vote’ is the best thing, and they take advice from countries that don’t even have ‘one man one vote’,” Liao said, referring to how neither the U.S. President nor the British Prime Minister is elected by a popular vote.The proposed changes, which include expanding the city’s Election Committee from 1,200 to 1,500 people and expanding the city’s Legislative Council from 70 to 90 seats, will make Hong Kong’s electoral system more “representative”, and less prone to “dictatorship of the majority”, Liao added.Critics say that Beijing would be able to stack the two bodies with even more pro-establishment members, to gain the numerical superiority needed to influence important decisions such as the election of the city’s Chief Executive, leaving Hong Kong voters with less direct say in who they want to lead them.People from new industries and services, such as information technology, telecommunications and healthcare, should be brought in as additional members of Hong Kong’s electoral collage, said Maria Tam, a senior Hong Kong politician who works with China’s parliament on matters relating to Hong Kong’s mini-constitution.People who can help Hong Kong’s youth take advantage of China’s economic development, such as through the national Five Year Plan and plan for the Greater Bay Area, should also be included, she told Reuters by telephone.Tam dismissed concerns that the reforms, aimed at ensuring “patriots govern Hong Kong” will crimp the space for opposition.“I don’t think it is just going to be unicolor,” she said.“Anybody who can draw the line between themselves and those who act against the interests of China and Hong Kong would have no problem whatsoever running for election, and winning,” she said.Tam Yiu-chung, the only Hong Kong representative in China’s top lawmaking body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, said separately: “If you are not a patriot, it’s going to be hard for you to get in.”",Reuters

Sometimes women’s underwear is used too.“The reason why we hang the longyis across the streets is that we have the traditional belief that if we pass underneath a longyi, we might lose our luck,” said one 20-year-old protester who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals.“The younger generation nowadays doesn’t believe it anymore, but the soldiers still do, and it’s their weakness.

The lockdown meant their special education classes were halted too, putting extra pressure on their female carer.“They were restless, uncomfortable, crying all the time, and waiting for me, sitting at the window ... sometimes in a very confused state, not eating well,” Mourya said.With more than 11 million recorded cases of COVID-19 and more than 150,000 deaths, India has seen cases rising again since early February. In Delhi, though, the virus is now under far better control, allowing Mourya more time with her kids.They still cry when she leaves for work, often clinging to the window for hours, but when she comes home, she says she is now able to enjoy giving them the intensive care they need.And there has been a bright spot in the family’s ordeal: while the older son finds speech difficult, the younger one has begun using words, among them, ‘Papa’.",Reuters

Polls close at 1800 GMT and final results are due on Sunday.“We are voting for peace. We don’t want any more endless debates between Ivorians,” said Aïcha Coulibaly, a hairdresser, who wore an RHDP t-shirt as she voted in Abobo, a Ouattara stronghold of the commercial capital Abidjan.The opposition is under pressure to show it remains relevant after over a decade of political dominance by Ouattara, who came to power after defeating the incumbent Gbagbo in the 2010 election and then prevailing in the civil war that followed.Gbagbo’s faction of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) is participating in a national election for the first time since he was ousted in 2011 and sent to the International Criminal Court to face war crimes charges. He was acquitted in 2019.“I am happy to participate in this vote.

We can also talk about the date of the elections and reach a conclusion.President Ghani met U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad in Kabul during the past week to discuss ways to inject momentum in the stalled peace negotiations with Taliban representatives being held in Qatar. After his talks in Kabul, Khalilzad went to Qatar.U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has begun a review of its strategy for Aghanistan, including an agreement reached with the Taliban in early 2020 that paved the way for talks between the insurgents and the Afghan government.Afghan officials and western diplomats said that during his visit to Kabul Khalilzad had floated the idea of establishing an interim government after bringing Afghan leaders and Taliban leaders together for a multilateral conference outside the country.But Ghani said the only way to form a government should be through an election.“I advise those who go to this or that gate to gain power is that political power in Afghanistan has a gate, and the key is the vote of the Afghan people,” he said.“Any institution can write a fantasy on a piece of paper and suggest a solution for Afghanistan. These papers have been written in the past and will be written in the future. Our guarantee is our constitution.”Elected two years ago, Ghani is not yet midway through his five-year term.Violence and targeted killings have surged since the Afghan government began U.S.-backed negotiations with the Taliban last September, and western security officials say the insurgents, already holding large swathes of rural areas, have begun to gain ground around towns and cities.",Reuters

February was Biden’s first full month in office.Last month’s total would represent the highest tally for the month of February since 2006. The sources who provided the figures to Reuters spoke on the condition of anonymity.An increasing number of children arriving at the border without a parent or legal guardian has forced U.S. officials in recent weeks to scramble for housing options and take steps to speed up their release to sponsors in the United States.The nearly 100,000 migrants detained at the border in February represent an increase over a figure of 78,000 in January. February’s total appears to be the highest monthly number since June 2019 during a large border surge that Trump cited as justification for a broad immigration crackdown.A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman said official statistics for last month likely will be released next week.U.S. Border Patrol agents caught more than 4,500 migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in a single day on Wednesday, according to government figures shared with Reuters, a sign that illegal entries could continue to rise in March.Republicans have criticized Biden for rolling back Trump’s hardline immigration policies, saying the shift will lead to more illegal immigration.Kevin McCarthy, the top Republican in the House of Representatives, sent a letter to Biden on Friday that requested a meeting to discuss the issue, saying he had “great concern” with the administration’s approach to border.“We must acknowledge the border crisis, develop a plan, and, in no uncertain terms, strongly discourage individuals from Mexico and Central America from ever making the dangerous journey to our southern border,” McCarthy wrote in the letter.The recidivism rate among migrants attempting to cross the border illegally increased over the past year under a Trump-era policy known as Title 42. That policy, issued on public health grounds amid the coronavirus pandemic, allowed U.S. authorities to rapidly expel migrants caught crossing. In some cases, migrants attempt to cross the border again.Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the policy in February.",Reuters
361,"Biden presses for $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan with governors, mayors
U.S. President Joe Biden pushed for the first major legislative achievement of his term on Friday, turning to a bipartisan group of local officials for help on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden/biden-presses-for-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-plan-with-governors-mayors-idUSKBN2AC10D,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden pushed for the first major legislative achievement of his term on Friday, turning to a bipartisan group of local officials for help on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.Biden invited a set of mayors and governors to the Oval Office and described what he said was a need to give those officials more help supporting millions of unemployed workers and reopening schools.“We need to help the states economically in terms of unemployment,” Biden said during a small part of the meeting that was open to reporters. “The federal government has a major role to play here.”The White House summit came as public health officials in the administration readied new guidelines for reopening schools and as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said “the time to go big is now” as she pushed for more stimulus globally during the first meeting of the Group of Seven wealthy economies since the new U.S. administration took office.The Democratic president’s proposed spending package, coming on top of $4 trillion enacted by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, would have important consequences for a global economy that is slowly and unevenly recovering after last year suffering its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.More than 400 mayors wrote to leaders in Congress earlier this month to urge them to pass Biden’s relief package, but Republicans are backing a plan with a much smaller price tag.Taking part in the Oval Office meeting were Republican and Democratic elected officials whose states and cities have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Many have seen tax revenues fall and costs soar as they race to vaccinate their citizens.The group includes four governors, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, and five mayors, including Jeff Williams of Arlington, Texas, a Republican.Williams, who met with Yellen virtually last week, said his city urgently needs the federal aid earmarked for state and local governments in Biden’s rescue plan. He said cities were crushed when Congress removed similar aid from a previous relief bill that passed in December.“We’ve been crippled. We haven’t gotten help,” Williams said in an interview. “Our property taxes are down and costs are way up. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican, this is the right solution so we can achieve economic growth much faster.”Arlington, which is home to the largest General Motors Co plant in the world, is bracing for a 10% drop in the appraised value of its commercial properties, which would cut revenues by some $30 million after an $18 million loss last year, Williams said.Biden on Thursday said the U.S. coronavirus death toll was likely to reach 500,000 next month, but said the United States was on track to have enough vaccine for 300 million Americans by the end of July.While economic growth is picking up, unemployment remains high and many communities of color are not expected to recover for years.",Reuters
362,"If Senate does not convict Trump, 'he can do this again,' Democrats warn",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/if-senate-does-not-convict-trump-he-can-do-this-again-democrats-warn-idUSKBN2AB15F,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic prosecutors making the case that Donald Trump incited a deadly insurrection by encouraging his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol warned the Senate on Thursday that if it fails to convict the former president, “he can do this again.”The first three days of Trump’s impeachment trial focused on his fiery words to supporters in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, when he falsely claimed that his election defeat by Democrat Joe Biden was the result of fraud and that the crowd needed to “fight” and “stop the steal.”The Democrats appear highly unlikely to secure a conviction and bar Trump from ever again holding public office given that only six Republicans voted with Democrats in the 100-seat chamber to proceed with the trial.“If he gets back into office and it happens again, we’ll have no one to blame but ourselves,” lead impeachment manager Representative Jamie Raskin told the Senate on Thursday, wrapping up the prosecution arguments.Fellow Democratic Representative Ted Lieu told the senators he worries about what would happen if Trump runs in 2024 and loses.“I’m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I’m afraid he’s going to run again and lose, because he can do this again,” Lieu said.The Democratic prosecutors provided example after example of Trump’s actions prior to the rampage to illustrate what he intended when he told supporters to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell” as Congress convened to certify Biden’s election victory.“Jan. 6 was not some unexpected radical break from his normal law-abiding and peaceful disposition. ... This was his essential M.O.,” Raskin said, using shorthand for modus operandi.“He knew that egged on by his tweets, his lies and his promise of a ‘wild’ time in Washington to guarantee his grip on power, his most extreme followers would show up bright and early, ready to attack, ready to engage in violence, ready to ‘fight like hell’ for their hero,” he said.The Democratic-led House on Jan. 13 charged Trump with inciting an insurrection. His term ended on Jan. 20.A two-thirds majority in the Senate would be needed to convict, which means at least 17 Republican senators would have to defy Trump, who remains popular with most Republican voters and has shown interest in running for president again in 2024.Dozens of former Republican officials who said they are frustrated with their party’s unwillingness to stand up to Trump are in talks to form a center-right breakaway party, four people involved in the discussions told Reuters.The nine House impeachment managers have argued that Trump planted the seeds for the riot by encouraging violence and making false claims about widespread electoral fraud long before Jan. 6, and must be held accountable for what happened.Five people including a police officer died in the riot. Two more police officers involved in the response died by suicide in the days afterward.Although the prosecutors’ arguments were generally praised by both parties, some Republican senators said they were still not convinced.During a break in the proceedings on Thursday, Senator James Lankford told reporters that the managers failed to connect the dots between Trump and the rioters.Senator James Inhofe said: “It’s just redundant, the same thing over and over again. ... To me, the more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it.”Trump adviser Jason Miller said on Twitter that the defense would wrap up its case on Friday, and some Republican senators said they expected the proceedings to end on Saturday.Looking ahead to Trump’s defense, the House managers disagreed that his incendiary language is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects free speech.“The First Amendment does not create some superpower immunity from impeachment for a president who attacks the Constitution in word and deed while rejecting the outcome of an election,” Raskin said.The House managers spent much of Wednesday recounting the events that led to the riot and highlighting the threat to lawmakers and to Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president, including searing security footage.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden watched some of the video on Thursday morning, adding: “Anyone who watched that video ... found it harrowing and deeply disturbing. That’s certainly how the president felt.”In a separate court case, federal prosecutors said on Thursday that anti-government “Oath Keepers” militia members devised elaborate plans to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6 and plotted to have an armed “quick reaction force” staged outside the city ready “to fight hand to hand” if ordered by Trump.Trump is the first U.S. president to be impeached twice and the first to face trial after leaving office. His first impeachment trial, which stemmed from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, ended in an acquittal a year ago in what was then a Republican-controlled Senate.On Thursday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer left open the possibility that Congress might seek a different way to punish Trump if the Senate acquits him. That includes potentially invoking the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which gives Congress the power to bar public officials from holding office if they engaged in insurrection or rebellion.",Reuters
363,Prominent anti-Trump Republicans reject third party,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-third-party-insight/prominent-anti-trump-republicans-reject-third-party-idUSKBN2AC053,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former Republican officials considering a new center-right political party to counter former President Donald Trump’s influence would face steep challenges in shaking up a U.S. political system that has favored two-party rule throughout its history.Reuters exclusively reported on Wednesday that more than 120 Republicans - including former elected officials, along with former administrators under Trump and former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush - met virtually on Feb. 5 to discuss forming a third party or a new center-right faction.Two of the most prominent anti-Trump Republicans in Congress - Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois - rejected the idea of a breakaway party in statements to Reuters on Thursday. Other Republican critics of Trump expressed similar skepticism - arguing a third party would accomplish little beyond splitting the votes of conservatives and helping Democrats get elected.The resistance to a third party among some of Trump’s toughest Republican critics underscores the extreme difficulty of such a political revolt. Such an effort would require walking away from the Republican Party’s massive political infrastructure - staff, money, connections and data on donors and voters - that would take years if not decades to build from scratch.An upstart party would also have little chance of succeeding without a charismatic leader who could capture the loyalties of millions of disaffected voters, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a senior advisor to the Republican primary campaign of Marco Rubio, a Senator from Florida, in 2016.“If somebody was going to start a third party that was going to gain some traction, it would be Trump” and not his opponents, said Conant.Kinzinger joined the Feb. 5 video conference of the anti-Trump group and spoke for about five minutes, a spokeswoman told Reuters. But the congressman wants to “reform the party from within,” she said. He has recently formed a new political action committee to support Republican primary challengers running against pro-Trump House Republicans such as Matt Gaetz, of Florida, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia.A spokesman for Cheney told Reuters in a statement that she opposes “any effort to split the party,” saying it would only make it easier for Democrats to enact policies that conservatives oppose.Both Cheney and Kinzinger were among just 10 House Republicans, a small minority, who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.A more likely outcome of an anti-Trump movement would be for centrist Republicans to try to purge Trumpism from within its own ranks, said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida who recently quit the party in protest of Trump and declared himself an independent.A party of center-right conservatives could never create a broad enough coalition to win national elections, Jolly said. And Trump has effectively undercut his more moderate opponents among Republican voters, he said, by ridiculing them as “Never Trumpers” and “RINOs” (Republicans in Name Only).“It’s just impossible to escape the ‘never Trump’ label,” he said.Others argue it would be much harder to wrest power over the Republican Party from Trump.“Let’s not kid ourselves; we are not going to change this party,” said Jim Glassman, a former undersecretary of state under George W. Bush.Glassman gave a five-minute presentation on the Feb. 5 call advocating for a new party. Any effort to reclaim the party would be “a soul-deadening slog,” he told participants.He told Reuters on Thursday that he sees the Republican Party as now thoroughly in thrall to Trump - and beyond repair.“I thought, if Trump lost by 7 million votes, there may have been a chance to do that,” he said in an interview. “But events since the election have made clear that’s not going to happen.”Asked on Wednesday about the discussions for a third party, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said: “These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.”Glassman believes there are enough Republican donors who are disgusted with Trump and willing to finance a new party. He believes a new conservative party could also attract maybe one fifth of Republican voters who disapprove of Trump, along with some independents and Democrats. Further, he said, running third-party candidates in House and Senate races would force the Trumpist candidates to tack to the center in general elections and temper the shrill partisanship of those races.Many people at the Feb. 5 virtual gathering agreed with Glassman. In a poll of participants, about 40% of those in attendance supported creating an entirely new party, according to one source with direct knowledge of the discussions. About 20% favored creating a faction within the party, and an equal number supported creating a faction outside the party, though it remained unclear exactly how such an independent faction would operate.While they disagreed on strategy, participants in the meeting said, attendees united on the need to organize and advocate for a return to “principled conservatism” that prizes the rule of law and adherence to the Constitution, ideals they believe Trump has violated.Among the group at the Feb. 5 meeting was Elizabeth Neumann, former deputy chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump. She’s enraged at Republican lawmakers’ continued support for Trump in the wake of his stolen-election claims, which she had repeatedly warned - before the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots - could lead to violence. Now she wants to politically target the lawmakers who voted, in the hours after the deadly insurrection, to overturn the presidential election result - and she’s open to any strategy that might work.“I hear arguments that we should break off and form a new party, or we should stay inside the party. There will come a time when this crystallizes,” Neumann told Reuters on Thursday. “At the moment, I’m more focused on the individual people and holding them accountable.”Historically, third parties have generally failed in U.S. elections, particularly at the presidential level, often serving more as spoilers than true contenders.Theodore Roosevelt, a charismatic war hero, had served two previous terms as president but lost in 1912 when he ran as a Progressive - or “Bull Moose” - Party candidate, finishing second, with more votes than the Republican candidate, in a three-way race ultimately won by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. That was the last time any third-party candidate won more votes than either of the two major party presidential candidates.More recently, the most successful third-party candidate was Texas billionaire Ross Perot, whose self-financed Reform Party campaign in 1992 earned him 19% of the vote in a race won by Democrat Bill Clinton, who unseated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush.In other cases, supporters of losing presidential nominees have blamed third-party candidates for siphoning off voters. In 2016, some backers of Democrat Hillary Clinton were frustrated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose percentage of the vote was greater than Clinton’s margin of defeat in key states.Republican Senator Rand Paul, asked about the prospects for a new party, told Reuters: “That’d be a good way to allow the Democrats to always win.”Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn laughed when asked by Reuters about a possible third party.“More power to ‘em,” he said.Cornyn, however, predicted shared opposition to President Biden’s agenda will hold Republicans together. He said he hopes life in the Republican Party will return to something more normal in Trump’s absence.“It’s made us all a little crazy,” Cornyn said.",Reuters

She believed the gubernatorial candidacy of Felix Salgado, who has been accused of rape, for the southern state of Guerrero is one example of that impunity.A representative for Salgado, who has not been convicted, did not reply to requests for comment; media reported he has denied the allegations.The accusation is based on a case a woman filed with prosecutors in Guerrero at the end of 2016, according to magazine Proceso.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said that those calling on him to drop support for Salgado, a member of the ruling Morena party, are politically motivated.In a country where femicides rose nearly 130% between 2015 and 2020, critics said the decision to erect 10-foot (3-meter) barriers around the National Palace is symptomatic of Lopez Obrador’s apathy toward the crisis of violence afflicting women.At least 939 women were victims of femicide last year in Mexico, according to official data.“Mexico beautiful and beloved.

This will be the sixth year in a row for a single-digit increase.Li, in his state-of-the-nation address to the largely rubber-stamp legislature, said this year the government would strengthen the armed forces “through reform, science and technology and the training of capable personnel”.“We will boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations, and enhance the military’s strategic capacity to protect the sovereignty, security and development interests of our country,” Li said in a government translation of his remarks.“We will improve the layout of the defence-related science, technology and industry, and enhance the defence mobilisation system,” he added, without giving details.Li set an annual economic growth target of more than 6%, significantly below the consensus of analysts, who expect growth could be more than 8% this year. China last year reduced the target after COVID-19 damaged its economy.Yang Yujun, a former senior Chinese officer now at Communication University of China, said it was a natural rate of increase given the many problems facing the economy post-pandemic.“China is facing a relatively complicated international and regional security situation, and the tasks of advancing the military’s modernisation, reform and building are also very arduous. It is very necessary to ensure sufficient defence expenditures,” he added.China is nervous about challenges on several fronts, ranging from Taiwan to U.S. missions in the disputed South China Sea near Chinese-occupied islands, a border dispute with India and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.The budget gives only a raw figure for military expenditure, with no breakdown. Many diplomats and foreign experts believe Beijing under-reports the real number.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby declined to speculate about whether China was under-reporting its defence budget.“I’m in no position to judge right here today what we believe about the veracity of the figure that they’re putting out there,” Kirby told a news briefing.China’s reported defence budget in 2021 is about a quarter of U.S. defence spending, which amounted to $714 billion in fiscal year 2020 and is expected to increase to $733 billion in the 2021 fiscal year.China has long argued that it needs to close the gap with the United States. China, for example, has two aircraft carriers, compared with 11 in active service for the United States.China routinely says that spending for defensive purposes is a comparatively low percentage of its GDP and that critics want to demonize it as a threat to world peace.Military spending accounts for around 1.3% of China’s total GDP, far lower than the United States, Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-backed Global Times, tweeted.“You will believe China is a peace-loving country as long as you are not biased,” he said.($1 = 6.4758 Chinese yuan renminbi)",Reuters

On Friday they also banned motorcycles and mopeds, popular among Sonko’s young political base, from the streets of the capital.Internet monitor NetBlocks said social media and messaging apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube were restricted early on Friday. Bracing for violence, some schools and shops were shut.Police in full protective gear guarded the courthouse as Sonko appeared before a judge. The hearing will resume on Monday.United Nations representative in the region Mohamed Ibn Chambas in a statement on Friday called for restraint and calm, and urged the Senegalese government to “take the necessary measures to ease tensions.”One resident said a coronavirus pandemic-linked curfew and general dissatisfaction with President Macky Sall was also fuelling public anger.“I don’t think things will be calm. People are rising up,” said 24-year-old fashion worker Souleymane Diallo.The interior minister said the government plans ease coronavirus restrictions soon, as the West African nation has started inoculations against COVID-19 last week.An employee of a beauty salon accused Sonko last month of raping her. Parliament stripped Sonko of his immunity as a lawmaker last week.The opposition fears the case is an attempt by Sall to remove a potentially popular rival if he decides to seek a third term in 2024.Other rivals have been targeted by criminal charges in the past, including former Dakar mayor Khalifa Sall and Karim Wade, the son of former President Abdoulaye Wade, eliminating them from the 2019 presidential race.The government denies political motivations behind the case. Sall, 59, in power since 2012, has not commented on reports he might seek a third term despite a constitutional two-term limit.Amnesty International expressed concern over the authorities’ handling of the situation, citing a wave of arrests, the use of live weapons and the suspension of the broadcasters.",Reuters

We are now working together... as key partners towards a successful COP26 and fully implementing climate agreements,” Araujo said, referring to the COP26 United Nations climate summit scheduled for later this year.Araujo said he and Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles had talked with President Joe Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, and his team. He said there were no “philosophical differences,” only differences in approach.Araujo had previously been seen as a climate skeptic, who had called theories of human-induced climate change a “Marxist conspiracy.”He acknowledged there was illegal deforestation occurring in the Amazon, which he said the government was combating.“The readiness to cooperate on deforestation is totally there,” he said, adding that the United States was open to “sustainable investment” in the Amazon.Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest hit a 12-year high in 2020, when an area seven times the size of London was cut down, according to government space research agency INPE.That followed on a major jump in deforestation in 2019, when Bolsonaro took office and moved to weaken environmental enforcement, which he has criticized as overzealous.Araujo said Brasilia was looking to forge an alliance with the United States based on the values of “democracy and prosperity,” with Brazil needing U.S. investment to transform itself into a modern market economy.",Reuters

Some countries including, Papau New Guinea, Micronesia and Vanuatu, have no women in parliament at all.IPU secretary-general Martin Chungong said quotas were important to make more headway.“We have seen in 2020 again confirmation of the fact that quotas, when legislated, well-designed and ambitious, have the potential to drive up women’s political and parliamentary representation,” he told journalists.He hailed progress in places such as the United States, where women now hold 26.9 percent of seats in the two house of Congress, a record high.

That margin suggested Democrats face an uphill climb in trying to convict the man who still remains popular with Republican voters.Oklahoma Senator James Lankford on Wednesday appeared emotional at his desk after Eric Swalwell, one of the House impeachment managers, finished his presentation. Another senator, Steve Daines, put his hand on Lankford’s arm in what appeared to be a gesture of comfort.But speaking to reporters later, Lankford struggled to connect the visceral images to any culpability for Trump, who in a fiery speech before the attack on the Capitol urged his supporters to “fight” his election defeat.“He’s had 100 rallies and we’ve never seen that before. So that’s the tough one to be able to link together,” Lankford said.Separately, Florida Senator Rick Scott said he was “disgusted” by the behavior of the rioters.But asked whether Trump bore responsibility, he said, “You know, I’ve watched what he said. He’s never said that somebody should break in. He actually said that people should do this peacefully ... Look, this is a complete waste of time.”Kansas Senator Jerry Moran called the videos “heart-wrenching.” But asked if he saw a link between the footage and Trump’s words, he said: “I’ll wait ‘til the conclusion of the trial.”Indiana Senator Mike Braun called the footage “riveting.”“But I don’t know that that’s going to make a difference for any one senator just having it on a loop again,” he said.Trump’s lawyer, Bruce Castor, agreed the House impeachment managers’ footage was emotional, but he seemed unworried about his client’s chances.“I believe it would have an emotional impact on any jury but ... and we haven’t played ours,” said Castor.",Reuters

So far, 260,000 people have died and 10.8 million infected, the second-deadliest after the United States.In the second village of Taracuá Igarapé, there have been no cases of COVID-19 thanks to its isolation, but preventing coronavirus from taking hold is paramount to protecting indigenous communities that live under one roof and cannot practice social distancing.The challenge of reaching 20,000 indigenous people living in a jungle area the size of Portugal is enormous, and requires helicopter travel, because travel by meandering rivers takes days, said Army Colonel Sylvio Doktorczyk.“When we talk about Amazonia, everything is superlative, including the difficulties!

He also effectively ruled out a lab leak.WHO officials had earlier said that the mission might issue a summary report before its full findings were ready.

During the early months of Brazil's COVID-19 pandemic, Rio de Janeiro police detective Fernanda Fernandes was certain that cases of domestic abuse were rising, but there was little she could do about it as few women came forward to file a report.

The number of complaints has, however, risen as the outbreak has ebbed, and more women have left their homes to lodge complaints with police, she said.Around the world, police and prosecutors, victim support teams and women’s movements, as well as the United Nations, have reported rising domestic violence during coronavirus-related lockdowns. The pandemic in Brazil has left many couples jobless, adding to domestic tensions, Fernandes said.The economy slumped 4.1% last year and Brazil’s recovery is likely to remain tepid as the country grapples with a brutal fresh wave of infections.Brazil recorded 649 femicides during the first half of 2020, according to figures from the Brazilian Forum for Public Safety, up 2% from the same period in 2019. But other crimes against women such as assault and rape, which usually require victims to file a police report, fell during that period, the Forum noted.“The decrease in the registration of some crimes in this period is more a reflection of the difficulties and obstacles women encountered during the pandemic to report abuse, than a sign of a reduction in cases,” it said in its latest October report.Fabiana Antunes, a shopkeeper, said that she finally gathered the courage to go to police in May after the latest attack by her abusive former partner, an illustrator whom she met five years ago.A year into their relationship, he began to drink more, forbade her from seeing friends, and became violent, she said. She left him two years later, but they were still living under the same roof at the onset of the pandemic, when his mood soured.“The pandemic - the fact of being stuck at home - made everything worse,” she said.In May, he struck her in the stomach during a fight, Antunes said, and she contacted the police. A judge issued a restraining order against Antunes’ ex-partner, who moved out, according to Fernandes and court documents.Yet Antunes still worries. Her ex-partner drew sketches which she showed to Reuters - of a woman who looks like her murdered by a man wielding a cleaver.Aldefran Melo da Silva, her ex-partner, said Antunes had previously been proud to feature in his artistic work. He confirmed the restraining order had been issued but denied wrongdoing.“We had normal marital discussions, but without any physical or verbal aggression,” he said. “I never hit her.”Fernandes - whose team in Duque de Caixas handled 4,121 cases of domestic violence in 2019, the most of any DEAM team in Rio state - has held Facebook Live sessions to brief the local community on the need to report signs of domestic abuse.Part of the challenge, she said, is convincing some women abuse is unacceptable. Others fail to grasp the danger of their situation as they do not believe their partners are capable of killing them.Taylaine Alves, a 19-year-old mother of two, was severely burned in a 2019 attack and later died in hospital from her injuries. Alves’ boyfriend was charged and is in prison awaiting trial. His lawyer from the public defender’s office declined to comment.“We mothers never forget,” said Jozilene Pereira Alves. “Life goes on, but a piece of me is dead.”Brazil introduced tough penalties for domestic abuse in 2006 with the Maria Da Penha law – named after a woman left paraplegic after being shot by her husband in her sleep.However, it was not until 2015 that Brazil officially recognized femicide as a crime – years after most other countries in the region, including Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Mexico.Paulo Cesar da Conceicao, who runs a rehabilitation center for men involved in domestic violence, called CR Homem, said most abusers struggle to accept their responsibility, blaming their victims for provoking them.Conceicao said that, in group sessions, his team guide conversations to help men to see their own responsibility for domestic abuse.“The men arrive in the group very closed and resistant, and we try to break that down,” he said.Daniela Gasparin, 38, says she lives in fear of her former partner, who was jailed after attacking her with a knife on a bus in the city of Boituva, in Sao Paulo state. Her ex-boyfriend was arrested and convicted in the case.“Even if he is in jail, I’m still scared he will get out and come after me,” said Gasparin. “This is a love I cannot understand. How can a person love and also try to kill?”",Reuters

Over the last five days, new infections have increased by 23% by comparison with the same period last week.“The virus is spreading rapidly across Italy,” said Silvio Brusaferro, chief of the Superior Health Institute (ISS). He said a highly contagious variant first discovered in Britain was now prevalent.Italy’s average reproduction number has risen to 1.06 - the first time it has moved above the threshold of 1 after seven weeks, the ISS said. An “R” number above 1 indicates infections will grow at an exponential rate.Italy has established a four-tier colour-coded system (white, yellow, orange and red) with curbs calibrated according to the infection levels and revised every week.Campania, centred on the southern city of Naples, will join Basilicata and Molise in the strictest red zone as of Monday. Movement will be severely limited, and bars, restaurants and schools closed along with most shops.Two northern regions will move from the yellow to the intermediary orange list - Friuli Venezia Giulia and Veneto. That brings the total number of orange regions to 10, with just six marked yellow and one white - Sardinia.In orange zones, restaurants and bars are closed except for takeaways and people are not allowed to leave their towns except for emergencies, work and health reasons. Some areas, such as Lombardy, centred on the financial capital Milan, have additionally decided to shut schools as a precaution.The country has so far registered 99,271 deaths linked to COVID-19, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain.However, data released on Friday suggested the toll might be higher still.Statistics bureau ISTAT said there were 100,525 excess deaths in Italy last year compared with the average for 2015-2019. According to official data, there were 75,891 deaths linked to coronavirus in 2020.",Reuters

This year’s edition is online, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with participants offered classes on technical know-how, interactions with other music makers and guidance from industry leaders virtually.“Five percent of music producers and engineers are women, which is abominably low,” Abbey Road Studios’ managing director, Isabel Garvey, told Reuters in the venue’s Studio Three, where Pink Floyd’s “The Dark Side of the Moon” and Amy Winehouse’s final tracks were recorded.“This programme that we’re running is shining a light on all of those characters behind the scenes and helping young women understand the opportunities.”The programme, which opened on March 1 and runs through International Women’s Day on March 8, features live masterclasses with leading female music industry figures and panel discussions with rising talent.“It’s really important to have women doing production so younger women can aspire to be and see that you can achieve and do well in this side of the industry,” said Melle Brown, a music producer, DJ and radio host from London.Garvey, 45, has been at the helm of the world’s oldest recording studio since 2014. Following what she describes as a “deep, dark history in finance”, she carved herself a career in music, rising to senior roles at major music labels.“My entry into the music industry was quite serendipitous in that it was quite a random start in the industry,” she said.“I joined ... when digital was 1 or 2% of the business ... Today we are over 65% digital ... Living that transition was very interesting. It kind of created new roles with no preconception of who needed to be in those roles.”The “Equalise” programme also features one-to-one mentoring sessions.“It never happened to me in my career to have a team of just females in the room: artists, producer, musician, songwriter,” Marta Di Nozzi, a senior runner at Abbey Road Studios, said of one festival session on making new music.“It felt awesome and it’s for sure something I would love to do again.”",Reuters

Four Hong Kong democracy activists were released from custody on Friday after prosecutors withdrew an appeal against a court decision to grant them bail in a controversial national security case following marathon hearings this week.

Some are appealing against the decision.In contrast with the global financial hub’s common law traditions, the new security law puts the onus on defendants to prove they will not pose a security threat if released on bail.Hong Kong laws restrict media coverage of the content of bail hearings.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing. China denies interference.While critics say the security law has been used to curb freedoms, Beijing and Hong Kong officials say it was vital to end the 2019 violence - political action they say was partly manipulated by foreign governments.",Reuters

In the absence of any explanation, I am tempted to infer that it is a form of defiance,” he said.Meghan and Harry have been headline news in Britain in the last week ahead of the broadcast of an interview they gave to chat show host Oprah Winfrey which is due to be broadcast on U.S. television on Sunday.",Reuters

The Biden family is a military family.”Pentagon leadership is under pressure to show progress in combating white nationalism and other extremism in the ranks, after current and former military service members were found to have participated in the pro-Trump siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.On Tuesday, the U.S. Navy’s top admiral condemned two racist incidents involving hate symbols on warships, which sources said included a noose that was left on a Black sailor’s bed.Biden made history by naming retired Army general Lloyd Austin the first Black U.S. defense secretary. In his Pentagon address on Wednesday, Biden stressed other groundbreaking achievements by Black soldiers, from pilots who fought in World War Two to soldiers who fought in the Civil War.“Right now, more than 40 percent of our active duty forces are people of color. Now it’s long past time that the full diversity and full strength of our forces are reflected at every level of this department,” Biden said.Still, discrimination persists in the U.S. military.Reuters was first to report last month that nearly a third of Black U.S. military service members indicated that they experienced racial discrimination, harassment or both during a 12-month period, according to a Defense Department survey that was withheld during much of the Trump administration.During his first days in office, Biden signed an executive order that overturned a ban Trump on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.Biden noted that Austin, upon taking over as defense secretary, ordered a review of sexual assault cases.“This administration ... is dedicated to ensuring that every single person is treated with dignity and respect,” Biden said.Biden’s visit, which included a tour of a Pentagon exhibition honoring Black service members, sharply contrasted with Trump’s Pentagon debut in 2017. Trump used the opportunity to sign an executive order prohibiting refugees from Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.Still, it left many questions unanswered about Biden’s approach to the Pentagon as speculation mounts about potential cuts to defense spending, the two-decade-old war in Afghanistan, future U.S. deployments to the Middle East and Asia and tensions with Iran.Biden announced plans for a Pentagon review of strategy toward China but there was no sign for now of any shift in the U.S. approach.Biden was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first Black American and the first Asian American to hold the second highest U.S. office.Harris paid tribute to barrier-breaking Black servicemembers.“They didn’t just join to make history.

Trump’s administration had sided with the states challenging Obamacare. A ruling is due by the end of June.Biden’s administration notified the court of the government’s new position in a letter filed by Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler.The case represents the latest Republican legal attack on Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. Republicans failed numerous times to repeal it in Congress, and Trump’s administration took steps to hobble the law.Biden, who was Obama’s vice president when the law was enacted, has promised to protect and build on Obamacare, which has enabled millions of Americans to obtain health insurance by expanding public healthcare programs and creating marketplaces for private insurance. Republicans have called it a government overreach.The position reversal at the Supreme Court was expected considering Biden’s public statements on Obamacare, and Kneedler said there is no need for further legal briefing before the court decides the case. The law had been defended in the case by Democratic-led states and the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.At the heart of the case is whether a provision of the law called the “individual mandate” that required Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a financial penalty was lawful. The Republican challengers had argued that the mandate was unconstitutional and that, as a result, the entire law should be struck down.Kneedler told the court that the government “no longer adheres to the conclusions in the previously filed brief” submitted by Trump’s administration. The Biden administration believes that the individual mandate was constitutional and, even if it was not, the rest of the law should remain in place, Kneedler added.During the argument in November, it appeared unlikely the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, would strike down the entire law.",Reuters

Those measures, and output cuts by fellow OPEC+ producers, have led to tight supplies of Middle East sour crude in Asia, the top global oil market. Asia imports more than half of its crude from the Middle East.“They talked to us. They said: ‘very soon they hope to resume oil supplies.’ We said: ‘Inshallah’,” said one source at an Indian refiner. “Inshallah” is an Arabic term that means “God willing,” used to express that the speaker hopes something will happen.GRAPHIC: China's Iranian oil purchases hit record in early 2021 -Restored Iranian supplies to India, the world’s third-largest crude importer, could reduce demand for spot cargoes, which has climbed recently after Iraq cut supplies and Kuwait reduced the duration of some contracts.India, which is hurting from the recent sustained recovery in global crude prices, expects Iranian supplies to return to the market in 3 to 4 months, a government official said.Another Indian refiner said they had been told by NIOC officials that a formal agreement on crude supply would be signed after Iran’s elections in June. NIOC has also reached out to other Asian customers.“Recently NIOC called us, asking about demand,” said a trader at an east Asian refiner. “It looks like Iran is getting ready to return to the market.”Another refining source said the talks were “very initial” and that NIOC wanted to know whether the company would resume Iranian oil purchases. The sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Unlike India, China never completely halted Iranian oil imports.Iran moved about 17.8 million tonnes (306,000 barrels per day) of crude into China during the past 14 months, with volumes reaching record levels in January and February, according to Refinitiv Oil Research.Of these, about 75% were “indirect” imports identified as oil from Oman, the United Arab Emirates or Malaysia, which entered China mainly via ports in eastern Shandong province, home to most of China’s independent refiners, or Yingkou port in northeastern Liaoning province.GRAPHIC: China's indirect Iranian oil imports by ports -The remaining 25% of imports were marked as official purchases for China’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves, Refinitiv said, as Beijing maintains a small purchase volume despite U.S. sanctions.GRAPHIC: Oman, Malaysia UAE crude flows to China -“Volumes started to surge from the last quarter of 2020, with Shandong province as the top receiving region which indicates independent plants are the main consumers,” said Emma Li, a Refinitiv crude flows analyst.Tankers carrying Iranian oil typically switch off their transponders when loading to avoid detection, but then become traceable via satellites near ports in Oman, the UAE and Iraq. Some transfer part of their cargoes to other ships near Singapore or Malaysia before sailing to China, Li said.Reuters is unable to identify the end buyers for these cargoes.Without commenting directly on the oil transactions, the Spokesman’s Office of China’s Foreign Ministry said: “Iran is a friendly nation to China and the two nations have maintained normal exchanges and cooperation. The cooperation between China and Iran under the framework of international laws is both reasonable and legitimate, and deserves respect and protection.”NIOC declined to comment. An official at the country’s Oil Ministry said, ”When the unjust U.S. sanctions are lifted, Iran will be able to sell its oil to any country, and I can assure you that many contracts will be signed.”Geneva-based tanker tracker Petro-Logistics said Iranian oil loadings in January exceeded 600,000 bpd for the first time since May 2019, a sign that the end of Donald Trump’s term may be changing buyer behavior.Indirect shipment arrivals in February, including those waiting to discharge off Chinese ports, reached nearly 850,000 bpd, beating the daily record of 790,000 bpd set in April 2019, according to Refinitiv and Chinese customs data.Chinese customs data showed on Sunday that crude imports rose 4% annually in the first two months of this year. It will release details for the breakdown by country of origin this month.“Iranian stuff started to slip into Shandong from late 2019... started with some cash-stripped refiners which processed oil first before paying for the cargo,” said an independent Chinese trader familiar with some of the transactions.Most of these transactions were settled in Chinese currency or euros to circumvent U.S. scrutiny, the trader said.The record imports have weighed on prices for competing medium and heavy grades from other Middle East producers, traders said.“While it does not seem that the sanction will be lifted anytime soon, Iran has resurfaced,” another trade source said.",Reuters

Additional footage came from an Alabama jail, hospital rooms, a police interview area and a community gym.Kottmann declined to identify other members of the group. The hackers sought to draw attention to the pervasive monitoring of people after having found login information for Verkada’s administrative tools publicly online this week, Kottmann said.Verkada acknowledged an intrusion, saying it had disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent unauthorized access.“Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this issue, and we have notified law enforcement” and customers, the company said.Kottmann said Verkada cut off the hackers’ access hours before Bloomberg first reported the breach on Tuesday.The hacking group, if it had chosen, could have used its control of the camera gear to access other parts of company networks at Tesla and software makers Cloudflare Inc and Okta Inc, according to Kottmann.Cloudflare said its security measures are designed to block a small leak from becoming a wider intrusion, and that no customer data were affected.Okta said it was continuing to investigate but that its service was not affected.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.A list of Verkada user accounts provided by the hacking group and seen by Reuters includes thousands of organizations, including gym chain Bay Club and transportation technology startup Virgin Hyperloop.Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the list or screenshots distributed by Kottmann, but they included detailed data and matched other materials from Verkada.Madison County Jail in Alabama, Bay Club and Virgin Hyperloop did not respond to requests for comment.Verkada says on its website it has over 5,200 customers, including cities, colleges and hotels. Its cameras have proved popular because they pair with software to search for specific people or items. Users can access feeds remotely through the cloud.In a 2018 interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Filip Kaliszan said Verkada had deliberately made it easy for many users at an organization to watch live video feeds and securely share them, such as with emergency responders.Verkada has raised $139 million in venture capital, with the latest financing announced a year ago valuing the Silicon Valley startup at $1.6 billion.Verkada drew scrutiny last year after Vice reported that some employees had used company cameras and its facial recognition technology to take and share photos of female colleagues.

2:35AM EST",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-slips-for-third-session-before-u-s-inventories-eia-data-idUSKBN2B2071,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil fell for a third straight session on Wednesday as investors took profits while looking ahead to U.S. inventories data due later in the day for pointers on where prices will head next.Brent crude for May dropped 63 cents, or 0.9%, to $66.89 a barrel by 0721 GMT, after earlier hitting an intraday low of $66.50, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April was at $63.47 a barrel, down 54 cents, or 0.8%.Prices gained support last week from the OPEC+ decision to largely maintain production cuts in April. They then initially jumped on Monday, with Brent rising above $70 a barrel, after attacks by Yemeni Houthis on Saudi’s oil heartland, before settling back as the alarm subsided.“It’s a realisation that there was no impact on supply from the attack,” Virendra Chauhan, a Singapore-based analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects said.A combination of factors including top importers China and India drawing crude from storage at current high prices and expectations of a return in Iranian supplies have also cooled prices, he added.In the United States, crude inventories rose by 12.8 million barrels in the week to March 5, according to trading sources, citing data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Analysts had expected a build of about 800,000 barrels in a Reuters’ poll.Official figures from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) are expected Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET.Meanwhile, higher prices are expected to bring more U.S. crude supplies back online.U.S. crude production is still expected to fall by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.15 million bpd, the EIA said on Tuesday, but that’s a smaller decline than its previous monthly forecast for a 290,000-bpd drop.The OPEC+ grouping - the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producers - may become the victim of its own success, analysts at EFG bank said, as higher prices resulting from supply restraint could incentivise U.S. oil production.“The current WTI oil price is well above the level needed to incentivise a substantial increase in U.S. production, which according to surveys by the Dallas Fed and the Kansas City Fed stands at around $56 per barrel,” EFG said.“The longer it remains above this threshold, the greater the incentive for U.S. and other non-OPEC+ producers to increase production.”",Reuters

The CSI300 index of mainland China’s A-shares rose 0.4%.Despite this, European and U.S. shares eased slightly as investors remained nervous about a bond bear run ahead of key inflation data and bond auctions in the United States.Euro Stoxx 50 futures fell 0.3%, while Britain’s FTSE futures traded 0.7% lower.Gains in Asian stocks came after Chinese shares had fallen to their lowest levels since mid-December the previous day on the prospect of tighter policy and a slowing economic recovery.“Markets are giving full attention to bonds. As earnings are not growing that fast right now, the lofty stock prices we have now will become unsustainable if bond yields rise further and undermine their valuation,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, senior economist at Sony Financial Holdings.The yield on benchmark 10-year notes slipped to 1.540%, having peaked at 1.626% on Friday, after Tuesday’s auction of $58 billion in U.S. 3-year notes was well received.Yet, many market investors remained on edge, with the next tests of investor appetite for government debt due later this week in the form of 10-year and 30-year auctions.“Although the bond market has steadied a bit, pressures will remain,” said Naokazu Koshimizu, senior rates strategist at Nomura Securities.“It has priced in future normalisation of the Fed’s monetary policy, the Fed’s policy becoming eventually neutral. But it has not yet priced in the chance of its policy becoming tighter.”Some investors see a real risk of an overheated U.S. economy and higher inflation on the back of planned spending by U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, including a $1.9 trillion stimulus and an even bigger initiative on infrastructure.U.S. consumer price data due at 1330 GMT is expected to show a slight acceleration in the overall inflation in February, with analysts expecting further gains in coming months due to base effects from a severe economic downturn in early 2020.The speedier rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in some countries and the planned U.S. stimulus package helped underpin a brighter global economic outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, as it raised its 2021 growth forecast.Some investors worry loose monetary policy could unleash inflation, though Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has so far pledged to keep low interest rates and maintain its monthly bond purchase of $120 billion.In foreign exchange markets, the dollar was supported by expectations of faster U.S. economic recovery.The euro eased 0.25% to $1.1871, not far from Tuesday’s 3 1/2-month low of $1.18355.

397,"Key Treasury auction could determine direction of yields
Investors concerned about demand for U.S. Treasury debt will be watching Wednesday's 10-year auction for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.
2:11AM EST",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-auction/key-treasury-auction-could-determine-direction-of-yields-idUSKBN2B20HN,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors concerned about demand for U.S. Treasury debt will be watching Wednesday’s 10-year auction for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.The U.S. Treasury Department has increased debt issuance dramatically in the last year to fund coronavirus stimulus endeavors. Roughly $3.6 trillion of new government paper was issued in 2020 versus $2.9 trillion the year prior, according to SIFMA. With President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion fiscal package on the docket, issuance in 2021 is slated to rise to $4 trillion this year, according to ING.Ballooning supply and weak demand at an auction of seven-year notes in late February helped send the 10-year yield more than 20 basis points higher, with spillover volatility in the equity market. That has put investors on watch for Wednesday's auction here of $38 billion in 10-year notes at 1 p.m. EST.“I think (the 10-year) auction will have a significant impact on sentiment over the next few weeks,” said Gregory Whiteley, portfolio manager at DoubleLine.Analysts at NatWest wrote in a note that the 10-year and subsequent 30-year auction - scheduled on Thursday - could cause “another mid-week surge in yields.”An auction on Tuesday of $58 billion in U.S. three-year notes went “not so well as to warrant any rethink” on the 10-year auction, said NatWest.A move higher in yields could also prompt a comment from the Federal Reserve, which holds its next policy-setting meeting on March 16-17.“If the market runs too far ahead of itself, I would expect (the Fed) to have to say something ... to cap rates from going too much higher,” said David Norris, head of U.S. credit at TwentyFour Asset Management.Whiteley said another 20-basis-point move higher in the 10-year yield is possible in the next week or two if demand at auction is weak.Among the tools the Fed has at its disposal are an increase in its Treasury purchases and an extension of a regulatory break on a rule called the supplementary leverage ratio, which would allow banks to maintain current holdings of Treasuries. Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell in an interview with the Wall Street Journal brushed off concerns about higher yields.“If the auctions go well, this could be a sign to the Fed that rates are increasing for all the right reasons,” said Meghan Swiber, U.S. rates strategist at Bank of America, adding that with a fair amount of demand at auctions the Fed might not “necessarily need to step in.”Key to the performance of Wednesday’s auction is demand from investors in Japan - the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt securities, according to Treasury Department data - as investors square away positions ahead of the March 31 year end. Some of the weak demand at the seven-year auction was due to less buying from Japan, said Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.“The same dynamic holds this week for the 10-year auction this week,” he said.But a further rise in yields following the auction could ultimately entice those investors back into the market and cap the rise in rates.“We think that as rates increase we could actually have Japanese investors and pension funds step in at these levels because Treasury yields do look really attractive relative to their local alternatives,” Swiber said.",Reuters
398,"Analysis: With $1,400 stimulus checks set to hit bank balances, stocks could benefit
A chunk of President Joe Biden's coronavirus relief package is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop and other stocks embraced by individual investors active in online social media forums.

The government should be able to start delivering checks almost immediately once Congress finalizes the bill and Biden signs it.“I do think that you will find a lot of that stimulus money will end up in the market, and I think if anything it’s a bullish catalyst,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab.A Deutsche Bank survey of 430 retail investors last month found that on average they plan to put 37% of any stimulus checks directly into equities.At that rate, the amount from the latest package that could go into stocks ranges from $25 billion, if only traders with online accounts spend money on stocks, to as much as $150 billion, if all stimulus recipients spend their checks in the market in the same proportion, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Parag Thatte.U.S. equity funds have been seeing near-record inflows of about $15 billion a month, “so incremental flows stemming from stimulus payments can be sizable, especially if deployed quickly,” Thatte said in an email.Despite a recent pullback in stocks, including a 10% correction in the tech-heavy Nasdaq, the benchmark S&P 500 is near record highs and has climbed more than 70% from lows during the throes of the pandemic in March 2020.If stimulus payments do flow into the stock market, they could end up disproportionately going to GameStop or other stocks favored by retail investors active on social media platforms.Frederick said that younger adults tend to be on the lower end of income brackets, and therefore more likely to be eligible to receive stimulus payments, and that younger investors are more inclined to invest in so-called “meme stocks.”Shares of GameStop were soaring to start the week, following news about the video game chain’s e-commerce strategy, while other stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets also were rallying.There was some evidence of stimulus excitement among investors on social media platforms. On the popular WallStreetBets forum, an account called “IwantSpaceX” posted: “Lets get our Stimmy checks IN!”The stimulus payments could add fuel to interest from individual investors that has already been rising, with the COVID-19 pandemic leaving Americans with more time in front of their computers or on their smartphones.Goldman Sachs strategists recently raised their 2021 net equity demand estimate from households from $100 billion to $350 billion, reflecting “faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021.”“We expect Households will be the largest source of equity demand this year,” Goldman strategists said in a note.Brokerage TD Ameritrade saw nearly 1.76 million retail accounts opened during January through September of 2020, a record amount for the company for the first nine months of a year.“People have time, people have interest and now they are actually starting to understand what it is they are investing in,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. “You have really started to see an interest from the individual investor in a way that we have never seen before.”",Reuters

That included 49% of Republicans and 67% of Democrats, who were among 1,005 U.S. adults polled online March 3-4.McConnell, who entered the Senate in 1985 and served as Senate majority leader from 2015 until two months ago, has played a vital role in numerous Republican initiatives, including the cementing of a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.He was re-elected to a seventh term last November, with a victory margin of nearly 20 percentage points.Asked to comment on the polling data, a senior Senate Republican aide pointed to McConnell’s strong re-election last year and his record-long term as Senate Republican leader, a position he has held since 2007 without opposition.Most recently, he found himself at odds with Donald Trump after excoriating the former president on the Senate floor for his role in sparking the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.Despite his bipartisan lack of popularity, McConnell was still viewed favorably by 28% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats.But those numbers still left him well behind other Republican figures.Among other current Republican leaders, Trump remained the most popular among members of his own party: 74% of Republicans said they had a favorable view of the former president, while 24% said they had an unfavorable view.Sixty-nine percent of Republicans said they had a favorable view of former Vice President Mike Pence, 55% said they had a similar view of Republican Senator Ted Cruz and 23% had a favorable view of hard-right U.S. House Rep.

402,House Republicans may follow Democrats in rebooting shamed 'earmarks' game,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-republicans-earmarks/house-republicans-may-follow-democrats-in-rebooting-shamed-earmarks-game-idUSKBN2B2094,"(Reuters) - House Republicans are weighing whether to join Democrats in getting back into “earmarks” - the practice of loading spending bills with legislators’ pet projects - and a decision is expected this week, two sources familiar with the process said .The sources said House Republicans deliberated on the issue twice this week, and sentiment is growing toward embracing earmarks roughly a decade after the party decided to scrap the long-standing practice amid a raft of high-profile controversies. Democrats who control the House agreed to bring back earmarks this year.A move to participate in earmarks will draw criticism from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, which has long criticized the practice as wasteful. It may also signal that Republicans are willing to negotiate on U.S. President Joe Biden’s next major agenda item: a massive infrastructure package.Earmarks are considered legislative “sweeteners” that Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, can use to dissuade its members from defecting on major bills and attract votes from Republicans who otherwise would reject the measure.If Republicans agree to participate in earmarks, they are signaling they could be engaged on an infrastructure bill and may be willing to trade support if it means getting funding for popular projects in their districts.“It would certainly suggest members are preparing for talks around the budget and infrastructure,” said a source familiar with the discussions.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s office did not return calls and emails on Tuesday seeking comment.Earmarks became a hot campaign issue in the early 2000s after a long string of scandals in which lawmakers from both parties secured earmarks to enrich themselves.In 2005, Senator Ted Stevens inserted an earmark to build a $223 million bridge to connect Gravina Island in his home state of Alaska - population 50 - to the mainland. Quickly nicknamed the “bridge to nowhere,” it became a lightning rod for critics.Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham of California resigned and pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from military contractors for steering business their way, using his positions on military committees to insert earmarks. In 2006, Cunningham was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison for accepting $2.4 million in bribes.When Republicans took control of the House in 2011, they banned the practice. Urged by President Barack Obama, the Democratic Senate soon followed suit. Earmarks have been gone since.Democratic lawmakers announced earlier year that they were bringing back the practice, hoping it could solve a few issues, such as keeping their narrow majorities together on big votes, boosting vulnerable members’ reelection chances in 2022 and perhaps attracting Republican support.",Reuters
403,"South Korea to exempt auto chip buyers from COVID-19 quarantine, provide vaccines

Germany and the United States have also ramped up efforts to resolve the shortage.South Korea’s leading automaker Hyundai Motor has so far kept factories running, but a Hyundai union official told Reuters on Tuesday that overtime production of less-popular models had stopped and production schedules were changing from week to week.Although the domestic auto industry’s situation was good compared to international rivals, “concerns about future production disruptions have increased”, the government said in a statement.Chip production capacity could not be increased quickly, with 98% of auto chips used by South Korean automakers coming from abroad, it added.To help deal with the shortage, Koreans and foreigners involved in auto chip imports or production would no longer have to quarantine for two weeks on arrival in the country from abroad, starting April.COVID-19 vaccinations would be available for people departing for essential purposes such as purchasing and procuring auto chips.The government also said it would speed up performance evaluations of auto chip components and modules developed by domestic companies.",Reuters

No Republicans voted yes, and just one Democrat voted no. The bill’s expected approval on Wednesday will enable the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.Passage of the massive package, one of the biggest U.S. anti-poverty measures since the 1960s, would give Biden and the Democrats who control Congress a major legislative victory less than two months into his presidency.The House will consider the legislation starting at 9 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Wednesday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters. The bill was sent over to the House on Tuesday morning from the Senate.Preliminary debate began on Tuesday afternoon.“Today we are on the doorstep of history. We are about to send the most sweeping and progressive economic investment in modern times to the president of the United States,” Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat and chairman of the House Rules Committee, said on the House floor.“This bill attacks inequality and poverty in ways we haven’t seen in a generation,” McGovern said, noting it included an expansion of the Affordable Care Act healthcare program, popularly known as Obamacare, as well as measures to cut child poverty in half.But Republican Representative Michael Burgess said the aid was not well targeted, providing $1,400 checks to anyone making $75,000 a year or less, “including those who may not have lost their jobs or experienced reduced employment” because of the coronavirus. He said the bill provided $125 billion to schools “even if they remain closed.”During the debate, multiple Republican members repeatedly asked unanimous consent to call up another measure, the Reopen Schools Act, but were ruled out of order.The Senate, where Democrats have effective control, passed its version of the bill on Saturday after a marathon overnight session. The chamber eliminated or pared back some provisions in an original House bill, including an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.The changes the Senate made must be approved by the House before it can make its way to Biden’s desk.Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a member of the House Democratic leadership, told reporters earlier on Tuesday: “We’ll pass it, hopefully with some Republican votes.”But Republicans, who broadly supported economic relief early in the coronavirus pandemic, have criticized the price tag of the relief package. It now appears likely to go to Biden without a single Republican voting for it in either the House or Senate.House Republican Conference Chairman Liz Cheney told reporters on Tuesday the bill would result in tax increases.“We are going to be saddled with a spending burden and a tax burden that is really indefensible from the perspective of what it actually accomplishes,” she said.Democrats hold a very narrow majority in the House, meaning that without any Republican support, they can afford to lose only a handful of votes by their own members against the bill. They lost two moderate Democrats the first time the bill went through the House, but one of those, Representative Kurt Schrader, said he changed his mind and backed the Senate-passed version.Some liberal House Democrats have criticized the Senate’s amendments. But Representative Pramila Jayapal, who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters she thought members of her group would back the legislation.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki has praised the legislation, saying that while there were some changes, it represented the “core” of what Biden originally proposed.",Reuters

Chevron Corp on Tuesday outlined a plan to expand oil and gas production through 2025, but without spending significantly more, and pledged to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chevron-outlook/chevron-vows-to-slow-carbon-emissions-raise-oil-output-with-modest-spending-idUSKBN2B11ND,"(Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Tuesday outlined a plan to expand oil and gas production through 2025, but without spending significantly more, and pledged to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions.Falling energy demand due to pandemic-driven lockdowns sent the industry into a tailspin in 2020 and led Chevron to a $5.54 billion annual loss, its first since 2016.Investors have been pressuring Chevron and other oil companies to hold spending flat and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change. Competitors Royal Dutch Shell, BP Plc and Exxon Mobil have vowed to hold output flat or allow it to decline to meet climate or financial goals.Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth told analysts in a presentation on Tuesday that Chevron can achieve its output and carbon goals regardless of oil price fluctuations.“We’re not betting on higher prices to bail us out,” he said in an apparent dig at Exxon and others counting on oil’s rebound to cover dividends and debt repayments. By 2025, Chevron can more than double its return on capital employed, a measure of how efficiently a company invests, to more than 10%.Still, some analysts were unimpressed with the climate and emissions goals, viewing them as too modest. Shares dipped a fraction from a one-year high to $109.50.A forecast of $25 billion in free cash flow through 2025 after dividends and project outlays is “underwhelming,” said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.The carbon intensity goals “lag the industry average” and “focus on its controllable elements” rather than building new business lines,” that could contribute to profits, he added.The goal of investing about 2% of overall project spending on lower carbon emissions, indicates Chevron is not pivoting its underlying operations, said Pavel Molchanov, analyst at Raymond James.“Others have longer-dated goals,” Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview. Chevron’s climate targets for this decade are “going to be very competitive with anybody,” he said.Other oil majors have outlined plans to invest in renewable energy and carbon capture and storage.Still, Chevron said through 2025 it would fix annual capital outlays at around $14 billion and increase oil and gas output by about 3.5% on a compound annual basis.It plans to beef up investments through 2025 in the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field, as costs of a major expansion in Kazakhstan decrease.Overall, it aims to boost output to around 3.5 million barrels of oil and gas per day (mbpd) by 2025, from about 2.98 mbpd last year. Permian production could reach 1 million barrels per day.Chevron will be the largest player in the Permian basin with a “wide margin on production volumes over ExxonMobil, roughly 40% greater,” said Peter McNally, analyst at Third Bridge.Its climate focus includes a 35% reduction in its carbon emissions rate per unit of production by 2028. Routine flaring of natural gas, a contributor to climate warming, will halt by 2030, officials said.The intensity target is less ambitious than rivals that look to reduce absolute emissions of carbon gases.

The Dow set a record intraday high but pulled back from earlier gains at the close.News that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields eased to as low as 1.523% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% on Monday. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster rebound and higher inflation that expected at the start of the year.The market is adjusting to the new level in interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.Companies whose products and services are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year’s rally.“Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,” Hooper said. “The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates.”Rising rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term.“Potential headwind for the market is (when) interest rates rise further from this point over the short period ... since they have risen too fast in too little time,” said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.3 points, or 0.10%, to 31,832.74, the S&P 500 gained 54.09 points, or 1.42%, to 3,875.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 464.66 points, or 3.69%, to 13,073.83.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.88 billion shares, compared to the 15.25 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.The rise in Treasury yields has accelerated a rotation from “stay-at-home” winners to stocks primed to benefit from the economy’s reopening, setting the blue-chip Dow on pace to end at a record high on Tuesday.While the Russell 2000 growth index jumped 3.3% on Tuesday, compared to a 0.1% rise in Russell 2000 value index, it has sharply underperformed its value counterpart since the start of the month.Shares of Tesla rebounded 19.6% from a deep sell-off that pushed shares down 37% from its peak in January to Monday. It was the largest percentage gainer on both the S&P and the Nasdaq 100.The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will take up the relief bill on Wednesday, with the chamber’s expected approval leading to President Joe Biden’s signing the legislation into law later this week.The bank index fell 1.7% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials hovered near record highs.GameStop also rallied 26.9%, building on Monday’s gain of over 40% on the video retailer’s e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.83-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 240 new highs and 17 new lows.",Reuters

Saudi Arabia said it thwarted the strike, however, and prices slipped as supply fears eased.Brent crude settled down 72 cents, or 1.06%, at $67.52 a barrel.

U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose sharply in the most recent week, according to trading sources, citing data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute released after settlement.Crude inventories rose by 12.8 million barrels in the weekto March 5, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a build of 816,000 barrels, sources said. [L1N2L72S5]“This is more of the same as refineries remain shut down,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures group, speaking after the API data was released.Last week’s record decline in U.S. inventories came after the shutdown of Gulf Coast refineries due to the recent winter storm in Texas.“The market seems to be softening on those concerns. It’s had an incredible run, and it’s due for a correction,” Flynn said.Official figures from the EIA are expected Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET.In a monthly report, the EIA said it now expects U.S. crude oil production to decline by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.15 million bpd, a smaller decline than its previous forecast of a 290,000-bpd drop.

The note has topped 1.6% three times since Feb. 25, reaching levels not seen in over a year.“It is important to put it into context - the 10-year has gone from 1% to 1.60%,” said Andrew Mies, chief investment officer at 6 Meridien in Wichita, Kansas. “If it goes to 2% nobody will be particularly surprised. I don’t think many people would expect it to go to 2.5%.”Tuesday’s auction of $58 billion in U.S. 3-year notes was well received, with the next tests of investor appetite for government debt in the form of 10-year and 30-year auctions later this week.On Wall Street, each of the major averages closed higher, led by a gain of nearly 4% in the Nasdaq, giving the tech-heavy index its best day since Nov. 4.The index has been highly susceptible to climbing rates, and Monday’s retreat left it down more than 10% from its Feb. 12 close, confirming what is widely considered to be a correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after earlier topping 32,150, rose 30.3 points, or 0.1%, to end at 31,832.74, the S&P 500 gained 54.09 points, or 1.42%, to 3,875.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 464.66 points, or 3.69%, to 13,073.83.“Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well. The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York.In Europe, stocks closed higher after extending gains from their best session in four months a day earlier as a rise in shares of oil and utility companies helped counter losses in miners.The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.8%, with the utility sector rising more than 1.5%.Investors will closely watch a European Central Bank meeting later this week for whether policymakers have decided to step up the pace of emergency bond purchases to appease skittish markets.Data on Tuesday showed the ECB barely nudged up its emergency bond purchases last week even before subtracting debt that matured over that period, raising fresh questions about the central bank’s resolve to curb a bond market sell-off.MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.35%.The speedier rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in some countries and the planned $1.9 trillion U.S. stimulus package helped underpin a brighter global economic outlook, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, as it raised its 2021 growth forecast to 5.6%.In foreign exchange markets, the dollar index backed away from a 3-1/2-month high, allowing riskier currencies such as the Aussie and the Kiwi dollar to move higher.The dollar index fell 0.434%, with the euro up 0.48% to $1.19.Oil prices backed off early highs in choppy trading, with Brent dipping back to the $68 mark as investors weighed easing concerns over a supply disruption in Saudi Arabia with the likelihood of limited supply from OPEC+ output limits.U.S. crude futures settled at $64.01 per barrel, down $1.04 or 1.60%.

It has also compounded the challenge of rejuvenating a brand famous for shoes worn by Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn.Overall sales fell 33% in 2020, one of the worst performances in an industry grappling with shop closures intended to curb the pandemic as well as a lack of tourists and travellers in general.Several sources told Reuters late last year that the majority owners had held informal talks with investors about selling a minority stake in their holding firm.

LG Energy Solution aims to build advanced battery cells for Tesla Inc electric vehicles in 2023 and is considering potential production sites in the United States and Europe, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

It did not identify potential customers then, but one of the sources said it was hoping Tesla would buy the batteries.In September, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced an ambitious plan to develop new cells in-house, prompting suppliers like LG and Panasonic to embrace the unproven technology or face risks of losing a major customer for the longer term.The Korean supplier, a unit of LG Chem, has made samples for the so-called 4680 large-format cylindrical cells, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. It faces technological hurdles and the challenge of scaling up production, people familiar with the matter said.“LG plans to produce 4680 cells at its new U.S. factory. They plan to build a new 4680 cell line to supply Tesla’s Giga Berlin in Europe,” one of the sources said, adding Spain is one of candidate for the European plant.One of the sources said LG has never mass produced such large-format cylindrical cells, although increasing battery capacity is the correct call. “Tesla is a major customer, and LG can take risks,” another source said.He said LG has not yet secured orders from Tesla for the 4680 cells, still under development. For now, Tesla is sharply boosting orders for 2170 cells used in the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in China, the source said.LG declined to comment, and Tesla officials could not be reached for comment.Tesla’s September plan to develop the new 4680 battery cells is meant to reduce production costs, improve battery performance and increase driving range. This would help with Tesla’s push to boost electric vehicle production significantly around the world.Tesla is running a pilot factory for the new battery cells in California, and preparing to build those cells at newer plants in Texas and Germany.Musk said recently Tesla is in talks with battery suppliers about developing 4680 batteries. He said Tesla will use the current cells for at least a few years, but will “retire” those cells over time.LG currently supplies smaller cells to Tesla in China, as does Chinese battery maker CATL. Panasonic has partnered with Tesla in a $5 billion battery “gigafactory” near Reno, Nevada.LG currently has a $2.3 billion joint venture with General Motors Co in Lordstown, Ohio, to make pouch-type electric vehicle batteries for future GM electric vehicles.GM said separately it is considering building a second U.S. battery factory with LG.The unusually candid comments from LG and GM came after another Korean battery supplier, SK Innovation, hopes the White House would overturn a recent U.S. trade ruling favoring LG, saying it threatens to disrupt battery supplies to Ford Motor and Volkswagen.Tesla rival Lucid Motors, which has a multi-year supply deal with LG Chem, and is considering whether to make its own cells in house, said it is interested in different cell formats, Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson earlier told Reuters.Panasonic plans to start a test line for 4680 cells in Japan in the business year beginning April 1, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two companies have not said if they plan to collaborate on production of the 4680 cells.Tesla may need to push out the timeframe for mass production, or work with partners at its newer plants in order to get cell production up and running quickly, said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.",Reuters

Norway has suspended the sale of a Norwegian engine maker owned by Rolls-Royce Holdings to a Russian-controlled company while it assesses the security implications for the country's navy and the civilian sector, the government said on Tuesday.

As requested, we have paused the sales process,” the spokesman said.Relations between Norway and Russia, which share a border in the Arctic, gradually improved in the post-Cold War era before suffering a setback when Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.That triggered more tension in the north with a military build-up on both sides and more frequent manoeuvres.The Russian embassy in Oslo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Besides Bergen Engines’ commercial relations with Norway’s navy, authorities must also consider the wider implications of the Rolls-Royce deal, said Jakub Godzimirski, a research professor at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.“It must be decided under Norway’s security law whether the new owners would get access to sensitive information,” he said. “If a Russian firm acquires a leading maker of engines, it could also give the Russian navy access to new technology.”While Norway welcomes foreign investment, this must be balanced against potential threats to national security, the justice ministry said. Maeland said she planned to brief parliament separately on the matter.Bergen Engines makes medium-speed gas and diesel engines for marine and power generation customers. It employs about 950 people and had revenue of 239 million pounds ($332 million) in 2019.",Reuters

There is apprehension about opting for co-CEOs again given the challenges of delineating responsibilities for these roles, one of the sources added.A co-creator of Alphabet Inc’s Google Maps, Taylor is a Stanford University-trained engineer credited with devising Facebook Inc’s “like” button as the social media giant’s chief technology officer.No decision has been made, the sources said. The preparations are a recognition of Taylor’s contributions to the company, they added.Colleagues described Taylor as an unassuming executive focused on developing new products. He was a key driving force behind Salesforce’s biggest acquisition, its $27.7 billion takeover of workspace messaging platform Slack Technologies Inc, as well as deals for software companies Tableau and Mulesoft, one of the sources said.The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Salesforce declined to comment. Taylor did not immediately respond to request for comment.Since joining Salesforce five years ago after the company acquired his start-up Quip for $750 million, Taylor has helped tackle thorny technical and product issues, integrating its various sales, marketing, e-commerce and customer service tools that run on different back-end databases.For example, Taylor spearheaded a system dubbed “Customer 360” with various software tools that allow clients to track their own customers.“He’s Parker 2.0,” said one of the sources, referring to co-founder and director Parker Harris, who led Salesforce’s early technology and product development and is still involved in strategic planning.Taylor served as Salesforce’s product chief before becoming chief operating officer in 2019. One of his biggest challenges will be to weave Slack into Salesforce’s other cloud applications to compete with Microsoft’s messaging service Teams, the sources said.Block became Salesforce’s first and only co-CEO to date in 2018. He stepped down 18 months later but remained an advisor to Benioff. A former Oracle sales executive, Block helped Salesforce land several $100-million-plus contracts.Benioff, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $8.5 billion, has expanded his reach beyond Salesforce in recent years, acquiring Time Magazine and supporting philanthropic efforts aimed at improving the San Francisco Bay Area.During the pandemic he has also spent more time working from Hawaii, where he has maintained a home for decades, the sources said.",Reuters

The Senate version eliminated or pared back some provisions included in the House bill, which had increased the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and extended expanded jobless assistance through Aug. 29.Now that it has passed the Senate, it must be approved again by the House before it can make its way to Biden’s desk and be signed into law.Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol that the timing of a vote on the House floor “depends on when we get the paper from the Senate.”“We’d take it up Wednesday morning at the latest,” she said.Like the Senate, Democrats hold a very narrow majority in the chamber, meaning they cannot withstand many votes against the bill.The first version of the bill passed in the House without a single Republican vote. Two moderate Democrats joined Republicans in voting against that version. One of them, Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, said on Monday he would now vote for the bill with the Senate changes.“My concerns remain on the size and scope of this bill but believe the Senate changes provide meaningful relief for Oregonians in need,” Schrader wrote on Facebook.“Funding for our local governments, small businesses, schools, families, healthcare providers and an extension on unemployment benefits will be a lifeline for many,” he said of the legislation.Republicans, who broadly supported coronavirus relief early in the pandemic, have criticized the price tag of the Biden relief package.On Friday, as the Senate vote was still under way, House Democratic lawmaker Bonnie Watson Coleman said she was “disgusted” by some of the changes in the Senate bill and questioned if she could support it. A spokesman for her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But Representative Pramila Jayapal, head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters she thought members of the group would back the legislation, which she described as “phenomenal” and in keeping with most of its members’ priorities.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised the legislation at a news conference, saying that while there were some changes on the margins, it represented the “core” of what Biden originally proposed.",Reuters

438,"Analysis: Dollar snapback may jolt post-pandemic recovery
A pause in the U.S. dollar's steep downtrend shows signs of morphing into a more robust rebound, posing a threat to post-pandemic economic recovery and investment flows into emerging markets.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-forex-dollar-yields-analysis/analysis-dollar-snapback-may-jolt-post-pandemic-recovery-idUSKBN2B11PD,"LONDON (Reuters) - A pause in the U.S. dollar’s steep downtrend shows signs of morphing into a more robust rebound, posing a threat to post-pandemic economic recovery and investment flows into emerging markets.The dollar had been weakening, falling 4.4% in the final quarter of 2020, a trend that usually heralds an economic recovery. But the U.S. currency’s rally has extended into a third month after the Fed’s apparent reluctance to push back against higher Treasury borrowing costs or rate hike expectations. The dollar’s gains total 3% in just the past two weeks against a basket of currencies.Emerging markets will bear the brunt of the dollar strength as it leads to sizeable outflows from these countries as seen last year.On Tuesday, the U.S. currency slipped, bringing some relief to markets. But its rise, as well as this year’s 64 basis-point advance in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, might well accelerate after passage of the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion package, should data continue to show a U.S. economy roaring ahead.Goldman Sachs predicts the U.S. economy will expand 7.7% this year and also expects a rosier outlook for jobs.Usually, a healthy U.S. economy benefits the rest of the world. But the explosive rebound in U.S. growth is allowing the dollar a “three to six month advantage” over other currencies, says Aaron Hurd, a portfolio manager who helps manages $145.3 billion in assets at State Street Global Markets.“This is about the differential pace of economic recovery, and the macro risk sentiment due to the potential for occasional risk-off moves,” Hurd said.So dollar bears may have to run for cover.Positioning data shows hedge funds paring net short-dollar positions to $29 billion last week. But that is still well above historical averages of $9 billion and not far from decade-high levels around $36 billion hit at the end of January.‘PROPER TANTRUM’Dollar strength tightens financial conditions globally, slowing the flow of capital around the world.It particularly challenges emerging market countries reliant on external funding. Analysis last year by the Bank for International Settlements found that every 1% rise in the dollar shaved 0.3% from the growth outlook of the emerging market countries studied.“Financial conditions are tightening faster, U.S. rates are rising faster than elsewhere,” said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro at Fidelity International.“A dollar rally along with yields rising, that will be a proper tantrum.”A rising dollar and higher U.S. bond yields pose problems for countries and companies that have big debts. When the dollar surged last year, it led to bond outflows from many markets.Now, as currencies such as the Turkish lira and Brazilian real sell off, investment banks are advising clients to cut emerging market exposure, noting that earlier resilience to higher U.S. yields was now cracking.Graphic: US real yields and the dollar -The dollar was hammered last year after the Fed cut rates to zero but higher U.S. bond yields have helped it recoup a third of those losses. Between mid-February and now, ten-year Treasury yields have risen 36 basis points, making them attractive to investors, which also boosts the dollar.Over that period, ten-year German yields rose only 14 basis points, explaining the dollar’s strength versus the euro. And on an inflation-adjusted basis, U.S. yields rose 37 bps versus 9 bps in Germany.Similarly, real yield differentials between U.S. and Japanese ten-year bonds have widened by 30 bps since mid-February, pushing the dollar 4% higher versus the yen.BNY Mellon analysts said the dollar’s rise had been “greenlit” by the Fed’s refusal to counter the real yields rise.“As long as this increase in real yields persists, the dollar should continue to experience upward pressure. It will require breakevens moving higher to put the brakes on the dollar’s rise,” BNY said.Breakevens refer to market-implied inflation expectations; a rise in those can be viewed as currency-negative.The dollar moves may not last. The U.S. currency does not have its previous interest rate advantage over rivals, the Fed may eventually move against rising yields, while economies elsewhere will catch up as lockdowns end.But in the meantime market volatility stemming from uncertainty over Fed policy will be dollar positive. Philippe Jauer, global head of FX at asset manager Amundi, notes a profound market shift; last year showed that the dollar is really the only currency offering shelter from turmoil.“There is no place to hide for investors in currency markets as either you are buying dollars or selling dollars depending on your view on risk,” said Jauer, who started the year bullish on yen but has since reduced that position.Graphic: US dollar and CFTC positions -($1 = 0.8427 euros)",Reuters
439,"U.S. Supreme Court dumps last of Trump's election appeals
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday disposed of the last of three cases brought to the justices by former President Donald Trump challenging his election loss, bringing a muted end to his futile quest in the courts to hold onto power.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election/u-s-supreme-court-dumps-last-of-trumps-election-appeals-idUSKBN2B01LE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday disposed of the last of three cases brought to the justices by former President Donald Trump challenging his election loss, bringing a muted end to his futile quest in the courts to hold onto power.The court without comment rejected Trump’s appeal challenging thousands of absentee ballots filed in Wisconsin, an election battleground that the Republican businessman-turned-politician lost to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 20,000 votes. Biden became president on Jan. 20.It was the last of three petitions filed at the Supreme Court near the end of Trump’s presidency that the justices declined to take up. The court on Feb. 22 turned away Trump’s other two appeals - a second Wisconsin challenge and one relating to voting in Pennsylvania, another pivotal state Trump lost. Lower courts previously had ruled against Trump in those three cases.It already was clear that the high court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump, had no intention to intervene in the cases and others filed by his allies because it did not act before Congress on Jan. 6 certified Biden’s victory. That formal certification was interrupted when a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol.In the Wisconsin case, Trump sued two days after the state had certified its election results. He challenged several Wisconsin election policies including one allowing the use of drop boxes for absentee ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both a federal judge and the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claims, noting in part that Trump had waited too long to sue.Courts around the country rejected the cases brought by Trump and his allies, sometimes in colorful terms. A judge put it this way in November in rejecting a Trump challenge in Pennsylvania: “This claim, like Frankenstein’s Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together.”Trump has made - and continues to make - false claims that the Nov. 3 presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and irregularities. Republicans are now seizing on those same unsubstantiated allegations in an effort to impose new voting restrictions in numerous states.The Supreme Court on Monday also turned away another election-related case filed by Trump ally Lin Wood, who had asked the justices to block the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections in Georgia. The court never acted on the request and Democrats won both races, giving them narrow control of the Senate.",Reuters
440,U.S. Supreme Court rejects case over 'qualified immunity' for police,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-qualifiedimmunity/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-case-over-qualified-immunity-for-police-idUSKBN2B01L6,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped a chance to review the scope of a legal defense called qualified immunity that increasingly has been used to shield police accused of excessive force, turning away an appeal by a Cleveland man who sued after being roughed up by police while trying to enter his own home.The justices declined to hear the appeal by Shase Howse, who said he was slammed to the ground outside the house where he lived with his mother in a poor and mostly Black neighborhood, struck in the back of the neck and jailed after police deemed his actions suspicious. Howse, who was 20 at the time, is Black. The police involved in the 2016 incident are white.Qualified immunity protects police officers and other types of government officials from civil litigation in certain circumstances, allowing lawsuits only when an individual’s “clearly established” statutory or constitutional rights have been violated.Police use of force has been closely scrutinized following the May 2020 death of a Black man named George Floyd after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck.The U.S. House of Representatives last Wednesday passed policing reform legislation that among other provisions would eliminate the qualified immunity defense for law enforcement. The legislation, supported by most Democrats and opposed by Republicans, faces an uphill battle in the Senate.Howse’s case was featured in a Reuters investigation into qualified immunity published in December. The investigation illustrated how the endorsement of this defense by courts has denied Black Americans recourse to justice under a law enacted 150 years ago specifically to protect them from abuses by state and local authorities in the post-Civil War years.Howse sued two police officers, Brian Middaugh and Thomas Hodous, accusing them of excessive force in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The officers said they used only the force necessary to subdue Howse.The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 granted the officers qualified immunity, ruling that no “clearly established” precedent showed that their actions were unlawful.In May 2020, a Reuters investigation revealed how qualified immunity, under the careful stewardship of the Supreme Court, has made it easier for police to kill or injure civilians with impunity by shielding them from lawsuits, even when courts determine police actually violated a person’s constitutional rights.Law enforcement professionals and some U.S. conservatives have argued that qualified immunity is essential for police to make quick decisions in dangerous situations without fear of lawsuits.In recent months, the Supreme Court has signaled a potential softening of its approach to qualified immunity. In two cases the justices allowed inmates to sue prison guards who had been granted immunity by lower courts from accusations that they violated the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.",Reuters
441,Biden's picks for key Justice Department posts face confirmation scrutiny,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-justice-preview/bidens-picks-for-key-justice-department-posts-face-confirmation-scrutiny-idUSKBN2B01IN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In her first big civil rights case after law school, Vanita Gupta two decades ago challenged the wrongful drug convictions of dozens of Black residents of the Texas Panhandle city of Tulia, all of which hinged on faulty testimony by an undercover police officer with a checkered past.Gupta, then a junior lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, went toe to toe with the local prosecutor. But she nonetheless managed to charm him so much that he sent her friendly emails with his daily morning thoughts, other members of the defense team recalled.“We were saying it was prosecutorial misconduct, and misconduct by the sheriff’s department that should get all these folks out of prison ... and meanwhile he is sending her his inspiring morning email,” civil rights attorney Jennifer Klar, a friend of Gupta, said of the case.The governor of Texas eventually issued pardons for Gupta’s clients. Gupta is now President Joe Biden’s nominee to serve as associate U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department’s No. 3 job. Her powers of persuasion and ability to win over adversaries will be put to an important test this week.Gupta is set to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a confirmation hearing on Tuesday along with Lisa Monaco, Biden’s nominee for the Justice Department’s No. 2 job. Gupta has drawn opposition from some conservatives, including the Judicial Crisis Network activist group, and is believed to face a tougher confirmation battle than Monaco in the closely divided Senate.Law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police and some high-profile conservatives including Grover Norquist have urged the Senate to confirm Gupta.The committee already has approved Biden’s nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland as attorney general. Garland awaits a confirmation vote on the Senate floor.‘HEART OF A LION’Monaco has drawn endorsements from figures in both parties, notably including Republican former attorneys general Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey.“We come from different political perspectives,” said Cliff Stricklin, a Republican attorney and partner with the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, who said he got to know Monaco when they worked together on a team that prosecuted executives from the defunct energy company Enron.“She has the heart of a lion,” Stricklin said. “When I saw she was nominated for the position of deputy attorney general, I thought she is the perfect person at the perfect time for that role.”Gupta and Monaco are expected to face questions from senators on topics ranging from civil rights enforcement to how the Justice Department will protect against future attacks by domestic extremists.Gupta’s portfolio, if she wins Senate confirmation, would include supervising civil rights, antitrust, environmental and community policing matters.If confirmed as deputy attorney general, Monaco would oversee the Justice Department’s criminal and national security matters and play a vital role in formulating criminal justice policies. She would help oversee the department’s sprawling investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of former President Donald Trump’s supporters.Now with the law firm O’Melveny & Myers, Monaco served as former President Barack Obama’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser and has extensive experience as a prosecutor and attorney on national security matters.In addition to serving on the government’s multi-agency task force that focused on wrongdoing by Enron after its 2001 collapse, Monaco worked at the FBI advising its former director Robert Mueller and later served as assistant attorney general in the National Security Division from 2011 to 2013 under Obama.The road for Gupta may be rockier.As the former acting assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, Gupta oversaw high-profile investigations into systemic abuses by police departments in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri. Former President Donald Trump’s Justice Department scuttled similar types of investigations into police misconduct.Gupta became a Trump critic when she served as head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights advocacy group.The Judicial Crisis Network recently starting running a television ad incorrectly claiming Gupta told Reuters in a article last June that she supports defunding police - a statement she did not make.Defending Democracy Together, an anti-Trump Republican group, has launched its own campaign to back Gupta’s nomination, running ads targeting senators seen as swing votes including centrist Democrat Joe Manchin, and launching a website called ConfirmingGupta.com.“The breadth of her support is quite deep and unique,” said Wade Henderson, who took over as interim head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights after Gupta’s nomination. “She is a proven consensus-builder.”",Reuters

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) believes carbon removal will be needed to remove up to 1 trillion tons of CO2 by the end of the century to limit the rise in global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius – the goal of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.Companies such as Microsoft, Chevron, Occidental and billionaires Elon Musk and Bill Gates have invested in the technology but it is expensive and experts say it needs government support to become commercially viable.The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden launched a working group last month to accelerate deployment of technologies to capture, remove and store CO2.Carbon Engineering customers pay a deposit for carbon removal units, sold at a minimum of 100 units, with the remainder due once the CO2 has been removed and independently verified.The companies did not disclose the price per unit.",Reuters

444,"Analysis: Air leasing mega-merger would rebuild ruined Irish empire
A tie-up between leasing giants AerCap and General Electric unit GECAS would reshape global air finance and reunite entities torn apart in one of Ireland's most spectacular corporate collapses three decades ago.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ge-divestiture-aercap-ireland-analysi/analysis-air-leasing-mega-merger-would-rebuild-ruined-irish-empire-idUSKBN2B02O7,"PARIS (Reuters) - A tie-up between leasing giants AerCap and General Electric unit GECAS would reshape global air finance and reunite entities torn apart in one of Ireland’s most spectacular corporate collapses three decades ago.Dublin-based AerCap has confirmed talks with GECAS to combine the leasing industry’s two largest aircraft portfolios in Ireland’s biggest ever corporate acquisition.“It creates a leasing colossus with 2,000 aircraft under one brand,” said independent industry adviser Bertrand Grabowski.A deal would reconcile estranged branches of the collapsed leasing empire of the late Irish leasing baron Tony Ryan, which rose to dizzying heights in the 1980s only to be laid low by over-expansion in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War.In a schism whose reverberations rumbled through the sector for decades, Ryan’s empire was split between U.S.-based GE Capital, which took over prime assets worth $1.3 billion to form GECAS, and a rump eventually acquired by Dutch-based AerCap.The split is set to be reversed with AerCap, now based in Dublin and already the world’s largest lessor, ready to regain the dominance once occupied by Ryan’s Guinness Peat Aviation.In between, leasing has evolved from the freewheeling risk-taking of Ryan - who later made a second fortune with Ryanair - to a disciplined asset class, basking in recognition from investors looking for solid returns backed by air travel.For airlines, the sideshow became so attractive that some strayed beyond the business of transporting passengers to compete with their own lessors. They speculatively ordered extra planes to rent out, before stumbling when markets headed lower.Most tellingly, as AerCap and GECAS fine-tuned their possible mega-transaction last week, budget carrier Norwegian Air quietly folded its own leasing experiment by cancelling a related order for Airbus jets.It is not the first time AerCap has taken control of a major competitor under Aengus Kelly, the candid and tenacious CEO who started as an accountant at what was left of GPA.In 2013, he agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp, founded by Ryan’s arch rival and fellow leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, after it was weakened by the financial crisis.Much of today’s leasing industry is run from Dublin by GPA veterans. Many lost small fortunes during the company’s downfall and built their reputations on cautious decision-making.But experts say risks remain in aircraft leasing, which depends on constant access to competitive funding and staying on the right side of a sometimes brutal industry cycle.“AerCap are doubling down here; it’s a gutsy move and I sense them thinking ‘we’re too big to fail,’ but a few banks have thought the same,” said a senior industry executive.Another said the new group, representing one-fifth of the world’s leased fleet, would require tough cost cutting.For AerCap, the crisis delivers a chance to bulk up in an industry that rewards scale, though much will depend on the price it pays for assets and the risk of future writedowns.For GE, the move would complete an exit from direct involvement in aircraft finance and leave it focusing on GE Aviation, whose jet engines tend to hold their value for longer than airframes.GECAS has been in focus for years. In 2019, Apollo Global Management worked on an offer worth up to $40 billion.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported talks with AerCap, pegged the new deal’s value closer to $30 billion, highlighting the current plight of the airline industry.“In terms of asset value, it’s probably not the best moment for the seller, but it does take advantage of the fact there’s a lot of liquidity,” Grabowski said.A new entity combining a fifth of all leased jets could help meet new competition from China, one industry executive said.It would also remove an umbilical cord between GE and GECAS, a captive in-house financier for its engines. GECAS has already started diversifying into jets powered by Rolls-Royce.Questions remain over reactions of airlines and planemakers.Airbus and Boeing have relied on a strong leasing industry to keep deliveries flowing during the pandemic, but now face a more powerful buyer.Regulators could also take a chunk out of the new venture by forcing it to sell planes in a weak market.Merging the top two players could speed consolidation at the next tier down, with HNA-controlled Avolon sitting in a distant second place and already said to be itching for a move.The deal may also send a chill through smaller players that flocked to the industry in the past few years looking for promising yields but are ill-equipped to deal with a downturn.AerCap’s Kelly has described such leasing industry small-fry as “tourist capital.”",Reuters

For money managers and advisers keen to market their sustainable investing credentials to European clients, going green is about to get a lot tougher.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-regulations-finance-focus/eu-prepares-to-turn-the-screw-on-asset-managers-over-greenwashing-idUSKBN2B11LM,"LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - For money managers and advisers keen to market their sustainable investing credentials to European clients, going green is about to get a lot tougher.Under a suite of new EU finance rules due to be rolled out in stages, beginning on March 10, firms including fund houses, insurers and pension funds that provide financial products or services in the European Union will have to begin disclosing how sustainable they really are.The new EU legislation, called the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), aims to help drive 1 trillion euros ($1.19 trillion) into green investments over the next decade, iron out the patchy climate-related information currently provided by financial market participants, and give firms with genuinely sustainable products an edge.“The crucial point is that this covers any entity or financial product,” said Lucien Firth, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons. “It doesn’t matter if you market all of your products as sustainable or none of them – it covers all of them.”The SFDR rules should make it harder for market participants to talk up environmental credentials without following through with action, so-called ‘greenwashing’, and could also determine how big a slice firms can win of the fast-growing market for products with a focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.Demand to invest in ESG funds jumped last year, driving assets under management up 29% in the fourth quarter from the prior quarter to nearly $1.7 trillion, according to asset management industry tracker Morningstar.“Those that already have a good offering in place are going to stand to benefit,” said Alexandra Mihailescu Cichon, executive vice president of sales and marketing at ESG data firm RepRisk.Set to roll out in several stages over the next two years, SFDR contains reporting obligations at both the company and product level, although investment managers say regulators’ last-minute release of final details of some of the rules is hindering their preparations.From this week, all funds must disclose in their pre-contractual information how they factor sustainability risks into their investment decisions.Additionally, those funds promoting environmental or social characteristics, or sustainability objectives, must explain both in their marketing and on their websites the objectives and how they plan to meet them.Firms must also give an assessment of the main negative impacts their investments will have on the environment and society, or explain why they have not done so. From June, firms with more than 500 staff will be required to report the impacts.“Any sustainability-related claim by a financial product must be well justified,” a European Commission spokesperson said. National financial market authorities will enforce potential penalties for non-compliance.Andy Pettit, director of EMEA policy research at Morningstar, said the rules would “go a long way on the greenwashing front... (it will be) much easier to compare different products.”Within funds, greenwashing could include one that is marketed as ‘sustainable’, but which includes lots of companies with high carbon emissions. The lack of a firm definition of greenwashing means it is often in the eye of the beholder.From March 10, funds will also begin deciding whether to label themselves as an Article 9, 8 or 6 fund - fully focussed on sustainable objectives; fully or partly focussed on environmental, social issues or sustainability issues; or not focussed on sustainability, respectively - with a hard deadline to do so by the end of 2021.Article 8 or 9 funds will eventually have to make additional disclosures about what their sustainable objectives are, and from next year report on them against a set of granular sustainability criteria.Disclosures at a company level will also expand to include data specified by the EU, such as CO2 emissions and water usage across an investment firm’s entire investment portfolio.Mike Everett, governance and stewardship director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said his team had analysed all the company’s products, updated pre-contractual documentation, secured regulatory approval and notified clients of the changes.The company would also publish additional company-level descriptions of its ESG process and policies and details of how the fund managers consider adverse impacts in the investment process.“These developments require significant effort and management, but are necessary in order to meet the requirements of the regulation,” Everett said.Many other firms, however, have yet to get to grips with the rules, according to fund servicing firm Apex Group, which pointed to a recent client webinar where just 17% of the audience said they felt fully prepared to meet the rules.While EU regulators have yet to confirm some of the data that asset managers will need to provide to back up their sustainability claims, there is also concern that some data does not even exist.Under the EU’s current Non Financial Reporting Directive, for example, smaller companies do not have to provide the same level of data as larger companies on factors such as carbon emissions and boardroom diversity - which could make it tougher for a small-cap fund manager to provide evidence of its portfolio’s sustainability under SFDR.Given the uncertainty, some investment managers are proving reluctant to commit to labelling themselves as fully sustainable and may wait until later in the year before finally deciding whether to define themselves as an Article 8 or 9 fund.“Investors are put in a difficult position as (some company)data needed to report on ...(the) mandatory indicators are not readily available from their investee companies,” said Anna Hirai, Co-Head of ESG Research at consultants SquareWell Partners.For Neil Robson, financial services and funds partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman, the greater transparency provided by the new rules should help drive change and potentially expose any lack of action at odds with funds’ green claims.“Despite the green agenda being front-and-centre in the general media, many fund managers are still following a purely financial, profit-led strategy without any particular ESG focus.”($1 = 0.8418 euros)",Reuters

It estimates, however, that the money flows are lower.The UAE did not respond to a request for comment.The Tax Justice Network, a group funded by donations and campaigning for transparency, said its study measured multinational activity, as well as tax rates and loopholes. While companies are not forbidden from using loopholes, the practice is viewed critically.“You don’t need to be a tax expert to see why a global tax system programmed by a club of rich tax havens is haemorrhaging over $245 billion in lost corporate tax a year,” said Alex Cobham, Tax Justice Network’s chief executive.Dubai, a party capital in the United Arab Emirates and a magnet for social media influencers, was hit hard by the pandemic as lockdowns hurt tourism and shopping while lower oil prices weighed on the Gulf state’s revenues.To counter the decline in local population and revive a struggling property market, after job cuts prompted many expatriates, who make up the majority of the population, to leave, it redoubled efforts to boost the economy.The government loosened rules to encourage international companies to establish a local foothold and bolstered schemes offering visas to rich foreigners.The country has been criticised by the Financial Action Task Force, the global dirty-money watchdog. UAE recently approved the creation of a new government office to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing.The Cayman Islands government said it “supports a fair tax system” and was committed to “international tax standards”.

He wants it to be very big and he feels that this is the key to the recovery package.”Graves said the infrastructure plan must be bipartisan and that a funding mechanism was needed.“It cannot be a ‘my way or the highway’ approach like last Congress,” Graves said, referring to previous Democratic legislation. “A highway bill cannot grow into a multi-trillion dollar catch-all bill, or it will lose Republican support.”Biden last month met with a bipartisan groups of senators on infrastructure.Democrats narrowly control both the House and Senate. Biden’s Republican predecessor Donald Trump failed to agree with lawmakers on a major bill to repair and replace aging and dangerous bridges, airports, water pipes and other projects.As a presidential candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion in fixing highways, bridges and airports; building climate-resilient homes; wiring cities for broadband internet; and encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing electric vehicle charging stations.",Reuters

Some of them are expected to challenge Republican incumbents.A civil war has erupted within the Republican Party, with establishment figures such as Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell eager to put Trump in the rearview mirror, and others, like Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham, believing the party’s future depends on the energy of the pro-Trump base.Trump has waged a war of words with establishment Republicans, some of whom he feels betrayed him by joining Democrats in impeaching him.Trump, now living at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, dangled the possibility of running for president again in 2024 when he addressed a conference of conservatives last Sunday.In that speech, he singled out Republicans Senators Mitt Romney and Pat Toomey and House lawmakers Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, suggesting he would support candidates who opposed them in Republican primaries.Still, Trump has committed to helping Republicans try to win control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate in 2022 congressional elections that will be a first referendum on the leadership of Democratic President Joe Biden.",Reuters
454,Exclusive: Georgia prosecutor probing Trump taps leading racketeering attorney,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-georgia-racketeering-exc/exclusive-georgia-prosecutor-probing-trump-taps-leading-racketeering-attorney-idUSKBN2AY0L0,"(Reuters) - The district attorney investigating whether former U.S. President Donald Trump illegally interfered with Georgia’s 2020 election has hired an outside lawyer who is a national authority on racketeering, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has enlisted the help of Atlanta lawyer John Floyd, who wrote a national guide on prosecuting state racketeering cases. Floyd was hired recently to “provide help as needed” on matters involving racketeering, including the Trump investigation and other cases, said the source, who has direct knowledge of the situation.The move bolsters the team investigating Trump as Willis prepares to issue subpoenas for evidence on whether the former president and his allies broke the law in their campaign to pressure state officials to reverse his Georgia election loss. Willis has said that her office would examine potential charges including “solicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering” among other possible violations.A representative for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.Floyd’s appointment signals that racketeering could feature prominently in the investigation. It’s an area of law where Willis has extensive experience - including a high-profile Atlanta case where she won racketeering convictions of 11 public educators for a scheme to cheat on standardized tests.The investigation of Trump focuses in part on his phone call to Georgia’s secretary of state, asking the secretary to “find” the votes needed to overturn Trump’s election loss, based on false voter-fraud claims.Willis - a Democrat who in January became the county’s first Black woman district attorney - will have to navigate a fraught political landscape. She faces pressure from Democrats in Atlanta and nationally to pursue an aggressive prosecution, along with scrutiny from Republicans in a state historically dominated by that party.Floyd declined to comment when asked about the appointment but spoke to Reuters about his past experiences working with Willis.In 2014, when Willis was an assistant district attorney in Atlanta, Floyd was brought in as a special prosecutor for the racketeering case that grew out of the schools cheating scandal.“It was very much a team effort,” Floyd said of working with Willis.The cheating case could provide clues to her strategy for investigating Trump, legal experts say, while stressing that the probe is still in its early stages.If she pursues racketeering charges, Willis will need to prove a pattern of corruption by Trump, alone or with his allies, aimed at overturning the election results to stay in power. While racketeering is typically pursued by prosecutors in cases involving such crimes as murder, kidnapping, and bribery, the Georgia statute defines racketeering more broadly to include false statements made to state officials.The federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was originally passed in 1970 to help tie Mafia bosses to the crimes of their underlings by allowing prosecutors to argue they conspired together in a “criminal enterprise.” Over the years, however, its reach has grown to include businesses and other organizations as enterprises subject to the law.Willis specifically listed racketeering and lying to public officials in detailing the possible crimes her office intended to investigate in a Feb. 10 letter to four Republican state officials, asking them to preserve records related to the case.“That letter was really a signal to the public that she was going after a number of possibilities,” said Clark Cunningham, a Georgia State University law professor.Georgia lawyers familiar with the state RICO law said Willis may be considering whether it would apply to alleged false statements made by Trump and his allies as they sought to influence state officials to reverse his election loss.“It’s not a stretch to see where she’s taking this,” said Cathy Cox, the dean of Mercer University’s law school in Macon, Georgia and a former Georgia secretary of state. “If Donald Trump engaged in two or more acts that involve false statements - that were made knowingly and willfully in an attempt to falsify material fact, like the election results - then you can piece together a violation of the racketeering act.”Racketeering, a felony in Georgia, can carry stiff penalties including up to 20 years in prison and a hefty fine. “There are not a lot of people who avoid serving prison time on a racketeering offense,” said Cox.‘FIND’ THE VOTESIn a Jan. 2 phone call, Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to “find” just enough votes to allow him to win. In the hour-long call, Trump repeated false voter-fraud claims, insisting he won Georgia by a landslide and that Democrat Joe Biden received thousands of votes from people who were out-of-state, unregistered, or dead. Trump made another phone call in late December to Georgia’s chief elections investigator, urging the official to “find the fraud.”On Dec. 5, Trump called the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to urge him to hold a special session of the legislature to overturn the election results. Three days later, Trump called Georgia’s Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, warning him not to interfere with a Texas lawsuit that challenged the election results in Georgia and other states.Carr stated publicly that he opposed the Texas lawsuit. The offices of Kemp and Carr did not respond to requests for comment for this story.Willis’ office has indicated it is also examining efforts to influence the election by Trump’s allies, including a November phone call made by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham to Raffensperger to discuss mail-in ballots; false election fraud claims made by Trump’s then personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in testimony at state legislative hearings; and the abrupt removal of Byung J. “BJay” Pak, a U.S. attorney in Georgia who angered Trump by not doing enough to investigate his unfounded fraud claims.Legal experts say prosecutors could use the pattern of false statements in a pressure campaign to build a RICO case, but that Willis would face the burden of proving Trump knew his fraud allegations were false. In a trial, Trump could argue that he did not deliberately break the law because he truly believed he had been cheated, said Kurt Kastorf, an Atlanta attorney and former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor.“Trump’s lawyers could reasonably point to portions of the call with the Secretary of State where Trump seems to be making clear that the reason they need to do something is because there is fraud in the election,” he said. “Prosecutors would need to respond with evidence that this asserted reason is insincere.”As an assistant district attorney in Atlanta, Willis employed the state’s racketeering statute in the complex test-cheating case - leading to a six-month trial, the longest in Georgia history.Willis led a team of prosecutors in laying out the case that educators had operated a criminal enterprise within the public school system in a conspiracy to cheat, winning convictions in April 2015. Willis and her team walked jurors through months of testimony in the intricate case, which accused 12 former teachers, principals and administrators of inflating scores on standardized tests to secure promotions and cash bonuses. Eleven were convicted; some got prison time.“I’ve worked on some pretty intense cases over the years,” said Floyd, the RICO expert. “But as far as duration and complexity, that would be hard to match.”As a private attorney, Floyd is widely respected in legal circles for his expertise and experience litigating complex RICO cases. In addition to the cheating case, he helped convict a former sheriff of Georgia’s DeKalb County for ordering the murder of his elected successor. Floyd successfully defended the conviction, which included racketeering offenses, all the way to Georgia’s Supreme Court.Anti-racketeering laws are a powerful tool for prosecutors, but building a successful case requires meeting a complex set of legal requirements, according to Floyd, who wrote the book, “RICO State by State: A Guide to Litigation Under the State Racketeering Statutes.”In 1985, he joined the Atlanta law firm Bondurant Mixson & Elmore LLP, where he still works. Prior to joining the firm, Floyd clerked for a federal judge where he was introduced to RICO cases. “I worked on a few of them there, and my interest grew,” Floyd said.",Reuters

Bitcoin mania has fuelled a surge in fundraising by Chinese companies seeking to expand their cryptocurrency operations or move into the red-hot sector.

Regulatory approval would represent a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates seeking mainstream endorsement.“Everyone can feel this euphoric atmosphere in the market, and Coinbase’s listing would lift the mood further,” said Jiang Changhao, co-founder and chief technology officer of Beijing-based Cobo a crypto custodian and wallet service provider.Cobo plans to launch a new round of venture capital funding this month to finance international expansion, aiming for tens of millions of dollars because, Jiang said, “the market is bullish and our business is growing very, very rapidly.”Kenetic Capital’s Chu said official backing for blockchain, and the use of the technology in major initiatives by giants like Ping An and Ant Financial, were a factor in the number of high quality blockchain and crypto projects in China.But the recent price surge had “poured napalm” on to competition in the sector, he said.Still, the entry of some Chinese firms into the crypto space has raised investor eyebrows.Last month, short-sellers Hindenburg Research and Culper Research alleged Chinese blockchain firm SOS Ltd, had made false claims about its cryptocurrency business, allegations SOS said were “distorted, misleading and unsubstantiated”.Guo of Univest Securities said the market has zero-tolerance toward cheating, but there’s nothing improper about Chinese companies jumping on to the bitcoin bandwagon.“If people don’t point figure at (Tesla founder) Elon Musk for endorsing bitcoin, what’s wrong with Chinese companies embracing it?”",Reuters

Dove soap maker Unilever will remove the word ""normal"" from its beauty and personal care products, as well as stop digital alterations of body shapes and skin colour of models used in its advertising in a push to be more inclusive.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-unilever-advertising/in-inclusivity-push-unilever-to-exclude-word-normal-from-beauty-products-idUSKBN2B1011,"(Reuters) - Dove soap maker Unilever will remove the word “normal” from its beauty and personal care products, as well as stop digital alterations of body shapes and skin colour of models used in its advertising in a push to be more inclusive.The move from the London-based company, which is one of the top advertisers in the world, comes as it tries to move beyond the backlash it has faced for some of its advertising campaigns.Unilever was pushed to rename its top selling skin-lightening brand in India to “Glow & Lovely” from “Fair & Lovely” last year after facing consumer ire over negatively stereotyping darker skin tones.In 2017, the company faced a social media outcry over an advert for Dove body wash, which showed a black woman removing her top to reveal a white woman. (reut.rs/3cgXXTc)More recently, an ad forced Unilever to pull all its TRESemmé haircare products from South African retail stores for 10 days due to a backlash.“We know that removing ‘normal’ alone will not fix the problem, but we believe it is an important step towards a more inclusive definition of beauty,” Sunny Jain, president of Unilever’s beauty and personal care division told Reuters.Globally, more than a hundred Unilever brands will have the word “normal” removed to describe skin type or hair texture, and replaced with terms such as “grey hair” for shampoos or “moisture replenish” for skin creams by March next year.Unilever said a poll it conducted of about 10,000 people globally showed that more than half the respondents felt using “normal” to describe hair or skin made people feel excluded, while 70% said using the word in advertising had a negative impact.The company also said it would stop digitally altering body shape, size, proportion and skin tones of models it uses in its own advertisements, or those of its paid influencers across all its brands, a move that started with the Dove brand in 2018.",Reuters

Last month, during a live game show on audio-chat app Clubhouse, tech entrepreneur and investor Noah Lichtenstein and his co-hosts handed out $3,200 in prizes funded by Square Inc-owned payment company Cash App, which sponsored the event.

But the service that regularly draws big crowds into audio chat rooms lured by surprise appearances by the likes of musician Drake and billionaire Elon Musk, is also quickly attracting big companies hoping to reach the estimated 8 million users who have downloaded the hottest new digital platform since TikTok.Brands are experimenting on Clubhouse in wide-ranging ways without a playbook. Some companies are offering money to well-known Clubhouse creators to sponsor their audio rooms. Others see opportunities to generate free buzz or get live feedback on their products, Clubhouse hosts said.So frenzied is the business interest that “It’s getting to the point where brands are investing and paying for people to advise them on how to use Clubhouse effectively,” said Kat Cole, a business adviser, investor and host of a weekly Clubhouse room called “Office Hours.”Companies have long nurtured corporate profiles on Facebook, which boasts 2.8 billion users, or Twitter with 192 million users. On Clubhouse accounts must be tied to an individual with their real name, though brands may create a Clubhouse room and host content from them, said a Clubhouse spokeswoman.Restaurant Brands International (RBI) Chief Executive Jose Cil used the app to take questions ranging from how he entered the restaurant business to the similarities between fast food chains and fine-dining establishments, all while in the back of an Uber, said Duncan Fulton, chief corporate officer at RBI.Cil and other executives enjoyed Clubhouse so much that RBI’s global Popeyes team plan to host their own session, Fulton added.Clubhouse stands out from other platforms because it gives users a shot at speaking with a major CEO or celebrity, said Ishan Goel, a brand strategist and founder of Goel Strategies, which has worked with clients like Colgate and Darden Restaurants.“I’m telling (executives) to just jump on,” Goel said. “Gen Z and younger millennials want to know who’s behind the scenes at these companies.”Last week, a group of Clubhouse’s top 40 creators, who were brought together to advise the app’s founders, launched a new company called Audio Collective to create a more formal structure to match brands with hosts. The company will help decide on sponsorship pricing and assist hosts with planning their events, said Catherine Connors, one of the founders of Audio Collective and a former Disney executive.While the app lacks advertising formats, some hosts are experimenting with inserting information about sponsors into the conversations. Shondra Washington, an Audio Collective founder and president of investment firm TBC-Capital, said she discussed her need for a new computer to incorporate mention of Upsie, a startup that provides warranties for tech devices and recently sponsored her Clubhouse room called “CrowdHouse.”Upsie’s sponsorship was disclosed verbally and in the title and description of the Clubhouse room.The sponsorship took place during the holidays around the launch of the highly sought-after Sony PlayStation 5, and led to an uptick in the number of visits to Upsie’s website, Washington said. “It was the perfect time to talk about it.”Some brands that missed the boat on hot services like TikTok, a short form video-sharing app, are trying to get ahead of the curve by diving into Clubhouse, even as the platform currently lacks analytics that help companies measure how well their marketing worked, Lichtenstein said.The largest prize to date that was awarded by Lichtenstein’s Clubhouse room called “I AM WOW $” which is sponsored by Cash App, was $1,600 to a musician from Texas who was out of work, he said.“I can’t say for Cash App how they measure (the effectiveness) of this, but delivering this much joy to people has to have a lot of value,” Lichtenstein said.",Reuters
461,"Analysis: From land of promise to pariah state - Myanmar coup rattles foreign firms
Shortly after the military seized power, 55 foreign investors in Myanmar from Coca Cola to Facebook signed a statement committing to the country and employees there during developments of ""deep concern"".

It said on Feb. 27 it was reducing its presence in the country amid concerns about violence and would pull its offshore exploration team - just one week after saying drilling would not be affected.This week, fashion giant H&M, which has around 45 direct suppliers in Myanmar and is also a signatory to the statement, said it had paused new orders from the country due to transport and manufacturing disruptions.H&M is not, however, taking any immediate decision on its long-term future in Myanmar.“We fully recognise the complexities ... in balancing different aspects to ensure that the people in Myanmar are not negatively affected,” said Serkan Tanka, Myanmar country manager at H&M.One large global firm has already made a dramatic exit. Kirin Holdings Co is winding up a beer alliance with a military-linked company after coming under pressure from activist groups.Escalating violence, which has seen more than 50 protesters killed, is only adding to the uncertainty facing companies anxious about reputational risk.“If this goes on for months, more would probably just totally leave,” said Murray Hiebert, senior associate of the Southeast Asia programme at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Operating in Myanmar has long been a wrestle between high risk and potential high reward for foreign business.The opening up of one of Asia’s last frontier markets in 2011 after half a century of military rule led to a surge in foreign direct investment. Net inflows peaked at $4.7 billion in 2017 compared with $900 million in 2010, according to the World Bank.But even before the coup, firms were grappling with crumbling infrastructure, constant power disruptions, legal uncertainty and an economy controlled in large parts by the military.While all foreign firms will be assessing and will be assessed over their next moves, energy companies - some of the longest standing foreign investors in Myanmar - are particularly likely to come under further pressure.The United Nation’s human rights investigator on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said in a report last week that countries should impose sanctions on Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), which is now controlled by the military and represents its largest source of revenue.Total, which has been in Myanmar since 1992, and Chevron have a large offshore gas project in partnership with MOGE. A Chevron spokesperson said it will comply with all applicable laws and sanctions. Total declined comment on the threat of sanctions.Telecom and internet companies too are in a difficult position as they deal with intermittent shutdowns of services and new amendments to cyber laws that threaten human rights.Norway’s Telenor, which has a mobile licence in Myanmar, said on Monday that the amendments broaden the powers of the military and reduce civil liberties, calling for the restoration of a sound legal framework in Myanmar.Facebook on Feb. 2 banned the Myanmar military from using its Facebook and Instagram platforms.Just how corporates should respond to Myanmar’s challenges is a matter of hot debate.Chris Sidoti, an expert on Myanmar who was part of a U.N.-led fact-finding mission in 2019, says all foreign firms should suspend their businesses in Myanmar because the military has taken over every facet of government.Rights group Burma Campaign UK has called on Western brands to be diligent with who they work with but not to abandon Myanmar workers. Nearly half a million people in Myanmar are employed in factories producing textiles for retailers like H&M, Adidas, Gap and Zara.John Bray, director at business consultancy Control Risks, said that pressure on firms in Myanmar needed to be guided by an assessment of “complicity”.“If you are providing a service for the Myanmar people, which they are paid for and which promotes the development of the economy, I don’t think you’re complicit in what is going on in the streets,” said Bray.",Reuters

466,'No sense of job security': Amazon union organizers tell lawmakers in Alabama,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-amazon-labor/no-sense-of-job-security-amazon-union-organizers-tell-lawmakers-in-alabama-idUSKBN2AX19K,"(Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers visited an Amazon facility in Alabama on Friday to lend support to a growing push to unionize its workers, in what labor leaders and lawmakers called one of the most important union elections in United States history.Workers at the Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, are voting on whether to become the first employees in the U.S. to join a union at one of the country’s largest employers.The visit comes on the heels of President Joe Biden’s recent statement defending workers’ rights to form unions. While he did not mention Amazon, he referenced “workers in Alabama.”The move by the Alabama workers, which is being backed by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), is a critical one for the U.S. labor movement that has struggled with declining membership in recent years. It is also a watershed moment for a growing unionizing drive within the tech industry that has long been hostile to organized labor.The congressional delegation includes U.S. Representatives Andy Levin, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Terri Sewell, and Nikema Williams.“This is the most important election for the working class of this country in the 21st century,” Rep. Levin said, addressing workers in Bessemer. “This is the biggest election in the south in a generation.”Rep. Sewell, whose district includes Bessemer, likened the fight to the civil rights struggles in the area’s past.“I know that Amazon workers stand in the same tradition as John Lewis...as those foot soldiers that dare to change the world by having the audacity to stand up for their rights.”Bowman went a step further and urged Amazon workers around the country to pay attention to their working conditions.The lawmakers also privately met with workers and organizers from the facility.“We just want what’s owed to us,” said Kevin Jackson, an Amazon worker at the Bessemer warehouse who attended the meetings. “We want a seat at the table.”Michael Foster, a lead RWDSU organizer, said workers at the facility reached out to the union for help, not the other way around. “We know we have people walking on egg shells because they have no sense of job security,” he said.Amazon spokeswoman Heather Knox said she does not believe the RWDSU represents the majority of employees’ views and that Amazon offered “some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.”Knox also said the company hopes “these members of Congress will spend this same amount of energy on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour —as Amazon did for all of our employees in 2018.”The vote could also help kickstart a new chapter for the labor movement in the southern states, where unions have long struggled to gain a foothold, labor experts said.One of the main reasons for this has been fewer job opportunities in the region and political hostility toward unions, said William Gould, a labor law expert at Stanford Law. Gould is also a former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).“But that is changing because of how companies such as Amazon have really tested the limits of workers’ endurance,” he said, adding that the pandemic had exacerbated existing health and safety issues.Bessemer, which is about 15 miles (24 km) away from Birmingham, the most populous city in the state, is majority African American - a fact that has also made the fight an important one for several lawmakers.Levin separately told Reuters Amazon’s policies are “egregious”, especially those such as “trying to force an in-person election in a pandemic hotspot.”The NLRB decided on Jan. 15 to not allow in-person voting due to safety concerns during the pandemic. Earlier this month, close to 6,000 workers began voting by mail on whether to join the union.Amazon spokeswoman Knox maintained that “Amazon proposed a safe on-site election process validated by COVID-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already-scheduled shifts.”",Reuters
467,Civil rights groups urge companies to join fight against Georgia voting restrictions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-georgia/civil-rights-groups-urge-companies-to-join-fight-against-georgia-voting-restrictions-idUSKBN2AX19A,"(Reuters) - Voting rights groups are calling on companies such as Coca-Cola Co and Delta Air Lines Inc to oppose efforts by Republican lawmakers in Georgia to enact sweeping new restrictions on voting access in the battleground state.The organizations, including the Black Voters Matter Fund, the New Georgia Project Action Fund and the Georgia NAACP, launched a campaign on social media and in local news outlets this week asking the corporations to take a stand against legislation they said aims to curb turnout from Democratic-leaning Black voters.Black voters were crucial to helping elect Democrat President Joe Biden in the November election and two Democratic senators in a January run-off in Georgia, a once unthinkable scenario in the traditionally Republican southern state.“Some of these companies have made beautiful statements for Black Lives Matter,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group focused on increasing Black Americans’ voting access. “Yet here, in the moment where it matters most, they have been silent.”Republicans in Georgia and across the country are using former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity.Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court this week to uphold voting restrictions in Arizona in a case that could further hobble the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting.They also opposed an election reform bill passed on Wednesday by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. The For the People Act, the most comprehensive voting bill since the 1965 act, faces long odds in the Senate, with Republicans saying it fails to do enough to combat fraud.In Georgia, likely one of the biggest battlegrounds in the 2022 elections with a U.S. Senate seat and the governor’s office on the ballot, Republican state lawmakers sponsoring the voting measures maintain they are meant to safeguard elections.A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House on Monday would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches.Some voting rights groups have increased their focus on corporations based in Georgia after Popular Information, an online politics newsletter run by Judd Legum, a former aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton, cited campaign finance records popular.info/p/georgia showing the companies had donated around $7.4 million since 2018 to politicians sponsoring the voting legislation.The groups took out several full-page ads in local newspapers urging Delta, Coca-Cola, Southern Company, Home Depot Inc, United Parcel Service Inc and Aflac Inc to stop the donations and support federal voting rights reform.Albright said the groups will encourage Georgia residents to call the companies and that protests could be organized in front of their offices.In statements to Reuters, Coca-Cola, UPS, Delta, Home Depot and Aflac said they were committed to voter rights but did not provide specifics about their stance on the Georgia bills or their future political donations.Coca-Cola said it paused political donations in January, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The company added that it supported efforts to “help facilitate a balanced approach” to the voting bills. Aflac also said it paused all political donations in January.Delta said it had not made any individual contributions to Georgia House or Senate candidates in 2020.UPS and Coca-Cola said they were working with local commerce chambers on voting rights issues. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce did not comment on ongoing talks, referring Reuters to a Feb. 16 statement in which the group said it believed it should be “easy to vote, hard to commit fraud.”Southern Company declined to comment.U.S. companies in general are becoming more reticent about the exposure that comes with political donations, said Donald Green, a political science professor at Columbia University.“This will give them yet another excuse to back away from that type of contribution,” Green said.Georgia’s Republican Party did not respond to a request for comment on voting rights groups’ efforts to enlist companies’ help in fighting the bills.The Georgia proposals have drawn scrutiny from More Than A Vote, a voter rights organization founded last year by NBA star LeBron James and other athletes to expand Black voter turnout and fight systemic racism in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.The group is kicking off a new campaign to fight efforts to restrict voting access. It will start by running a 30-second advertisement narrated by James during the televised NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta on Sunday.",Reuters

U.S.-listed shares of the three automakers rose between 3.7% and 5.3% in early deals.The plans come as the trio increase capital raising efforts to fund technology development and expand sales networks, to better compete in the world’s biggest EV market where U.S. peer Tesla Inc is boosting sales of its China-made vehicles.This year is set to be crucial for EV makers to seize market share as the industry expects China sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) to jump almost 40% from last year to 1.8 million units.“Despite much richer financial resources now compared with a year ago, EV start-ups still need to invest heavily in next-generation technology,” said analyst Shi Ji at Haitong International. “Exploring a secondary listing much closer to their home market, if any, is a good move.”Selling shares in Hong Kong would also add the trio to a slew of New York-listed Chinese firms seeking a presence on more local exchanges amid Sino-U.S. political tension.The rising number of such listings “has enhanced the status of Hong Kong’s capital markets globally, and also helped issuers reach higher valuations and raise more capital,” said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset.Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.Li Auto and Xpeng went public in the United States mid-last year so will likely apply in Hong Kong for a dual primary listing, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter.As per Hong Kong’s dual primary listing rules, firms are subject to full bourse requirements in Hong Kong and a second exchange, but are not bound by the two-year condition.Xpeng is also considering a third listing on Shanghai’s STAR Market for new-economy firms, said two other people.“In the long run, it’s helpful for consumer-focused companies like us to connect with domestic capital markets and domestic investors,” Xpeng President Brian Gu told Reuters last week, declining to comment on any Hong Kong listing plan.“This is the direction we should pay attention to.”China’s government has heavily promoted NEVs - such as battery-powered, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars - in response to chronic air pollution, spurring interest from technology companies and investors alike.Last month, Reuters reported telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd plans to market EVs as early as this year.China forecasts NEVs will make up 20% of its annual auto sales by 2025 from around 5% in 2020.Domestic vehicle deliveries last year totalled 32,624 by Li Auto, 43,728 by Nio and 27,041 by Xpeng.

The official news outlet of the Communist Party of China's Xinjiang region said unidentified companies from the area have filed a domestic civil lawsuit seeking unspecified compensation from a U.S.-based human rights researcher whose reports alleged forced labour is used in the region's cotton industry.

The Xinjiang government did not immediately respond to a request for more details on the case on Tuesday.Experts said if it the suit would be the first known instance of a foreign researcher facing civil action in China over human rights research that has contributed to pressure for economic sanctions, and comes as Beijing has been stepping up its defence against foreign accusations of human rights abuses, which it denies.The administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump in December banned imports of cotton from Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), which produces around 30% of China’s cotton. In January it announced an import ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations that they were made with forced labour, without citing the source of the allegations.XPCC could not be reached for comment by Reuters on Tuesday.“It (the suit) would seem to be a tactic to try to raise the costs for those doing research on these kinds of severe human rights abuses,” said Sarah Cook, New York-based Research Director for China at U.S. non-profit Freedom House.“It could set a worrisome precedent ... it could send a signal to foreign companies or others who might be considering being more outspoken or changing business practices due to what is happening in Xinjiang,” she said.Zenz is a senior fellow in China studies at the U.S.-based Victims of Communism Foundation, a non-profit that researches human rights in communist countries, and a critic of China’s ethnic policy in Xinjiang and Tibet whose research has been widely cited in western media, including Reuters.Zenz said the lawsuit shows that his research is having an impact, although he believes the case is symbolic. He said he had last been in China more than a decade ago and has no intention of returning to China in the immediate future.“That’s probably the most direct statement that some of these companies are incurring economic losses as the result of my publication,” he told Reuters on Tuesday. He said he had no knowledge of the contents of the suit.Zen in December published a report that estimated around half a million people from ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are employed in cotton picking through coercive labour transfer programmes. The research was based on an analysis of Chinese government documents and state media.Last July, state media reported that Beijing was considering suing Zenz for libelling China, though no public information has since been released on any potential case and Zenz has not heard of any suit.On Monday, China’s parliament said it will speed up lawmaking aimed at countering foreign sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction” amid increasing pressure from Western countries over issues ranging from Xinjiang to civil rights in Hong Kong.",Reuters

Three ships carrying ethanol were heading to China from the U.S. Gulf Coast, three trade sources told Reuters on Monday, in a sign that exports of the fuel were sharply increasing from the United States to the country.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-china-exclusive/exclusive-three-ships-carrying-u-s-ethanol-head-to-china-sources-idUSKBN2B02JN,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three ships carrying ethanol were heading to China from the U.S. Gulf Coast, three trade sources told Reuters on Monday, in a sign that exports of the fuel were sharply increasing from the United States to the country.The shipments may surpass the total amount of U.S. ethanol that China imported last year, a positive development for the U.S. ethanol industry, which has seen decreased demand because of the coronavirus pandemic and the U.S.-China trade war.The ships each have a capacity of around 30,000 tonnes, or about 240,000 barrels of ethanol, the sources said, though the exact amount of the renewable fuel onboard was not immediately clear.GRAPHIC: US ethanol exports to China vs the rest of the World -It was also unclear when the cargoes would arrive in China, which buys U.S. ethanol for fuel to blend with gasoline. One source said at least two of the tankers left at the end of February.The three cargoes should be among vessels booked earlier, and more were expected to get shipped to China in the coming months, three Asia-based traders said.In January, Archer Daniels Midland Co Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said that China had bought “roughly 200 million gallons” (4.76 million barrels) of U.S. ethanol for the first half of 2021.That would be equivalent to around 15-20 vessels of the renewable fuel, the traders said, mainly booked last year, when U.S. ethanol prices hit their lowest point.COFCO and Sinopec were among buyers of the U.S. cargoes, traders had said.Two cargoes booked by COFCO have already arrived in China recently while Sinopec is shipping imported ethanol to the domestic markets, said one China-based source familiar with the ethanol trade.GRAPHIC: US ethanol & gasoline prices -“Domestic grain prices keep rising, which has pushed up prices of domestic ethanol, and created great profit margin for importing ethanol,” said the source, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.COFCO and Sinopec did not immediately respond to faxes seeking comment.While China imported an annual record of 4.72 million barrels of U.S. ethanol in 2016, it has not recently been a large importer. However, tightening supplies of domestic corn used to make the biofuel, coupled with comparatively cheaper U.S. prices have spurred the need for imports.“Domestic corn is too expensive,” said a China-based trader with an international trading house, making imports profitable.U.S. ethanol to China on a CIF basis is currently quoted at around $700 per tonne, while domestic ethanol in March is a bit over $1,000 per tonne, according to the trader.If all three tankers were filled to capacity, the cargoes would be equivalent to around 720,000 barrels of ethanol, more than the 506,000 barrels of U.S. ethanol shipped to China in the whole of 2020.The increased exports come as the U.S. ethanol industry tries to return to more normal levels of production following the demand destruction from the pandemic. Ethanol production has increased to 849,000 barrels per day in the week to Feb. 26, from a record low of 537,000 bpd last April, EIA data showed.The United States and China signed a trade deal in January 2020, where China pledged to purchase more of American farm, energy and manufactured goods.",Reuters

But NASA announced in January that the target date had slipped to April 20.The schedule was adjusted again on the basis of available flight times to the space station, driven by orbital mechanics, that would keep the astronauts’ need for sleep shifting to a minimum, NASA spokesman Dan Huot said on Monday.The flight marks only the second full-fledged space station crew-rotation mission launched aboard a private company’s spacecraft - a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket tipped with the Crew Dragon capsule it will carry into orbit.The four-member SpaceX Crew-2 consists of two NASA astronauts, mission commander Shane Kimbrough and pilot Megan McArthur, along with Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and fellow mission specialist Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency.After docking with the space station, they will join the four SpaceX Crew-1 astronauts who arrived in November, and cosmonauts carried to the orbiting outpost aboard a Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft.The newly arrived Crew-2 are to remain in orbit six months, while Crew-1 is due to return to earth by early May.McArthur will become the second person from her family to ride a Crew Dragon into space.

473,"Harley borrows Detroit's used-car playbook to pursue younger riders
Harley-Davidson Inc has decided the best way to get younger customers to buy a new motorcycle is to sell them a used one first.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-harley-davidson-used-bikes-focus/harley-borrows-detroits-used-car-playbook-to-pursue-younger-riders-idUSKBN2B017A,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc has decided the best way to get younger customers to buy a new motorcycle is to sell them a used one first.The Milwaukee-based company plans to roll out a certified pre-owned bike program, known as H-D Certified, adapting a strategy carmakers have been following for years to position well-tended used vehicles as a substitute for low-margin, “entry-level” new models.Harley’s embrace of used bikes is part of a new five-year turnaround strategy under Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz, and is the latest effort to expand the brand’s appeal beyond middle-aged and affluent riders.The 118-year-old American brand has been steadily losing U.S. market share amid declining retail sales for six years.(For a graphic on Harley's U.S. market share, click  )But the demand for used Harleys, which are less expensive, has remained strong. Some dealers told Reuters that pre-owned bikes last year outsold new ones by three-to-one.Melissa Walters, owner of a Harley dealership in Fresno, California, says the coronavirus pandemic has led to an increased demand for outdoor recreational activity, but dealers are hard-pressed to find bikes to sell to customers.“People are tired of staying home,” she said. “They want to go out and do something.”That sentiment was echoed by over a dozen dealers in six states.Data from industry consultant J.D. Power shows Harley was the most sought-after brand in the used big bikes market last year, boosting bets the certified program will draw in new customers.For Harley, it offers a way to build brand loyalty and attract new customers without engineering and manufacturing new lower-cost bikes, which tend to have lower profit margins.“We believe this program will drive Harley-Davidson desirability, increase sales and margins, and enhance the overall customer experience while supporting growth,” Zeitz told Reuters.Under the pre-owned bike program, which was revealed last month, Harley will certify motorcycles up to five years old with up to 25,000 miles (40,234 km). Certified bikes will be inspected and backed by a 12-month limited warranty, and can be financed by Harley’s financial arm, distinguishing them from other used Harleys.While the heavyweight motorcycle maker has a similar program in the United Kingdom, this is the first time it is entering the used marketplace in the United States - its biggest market.The program will be launched in late April and over 300 dealers have expressed interest in participating so far, Harley told Reuters.“It’s going to draw new riders ... and will give them entry into the Harley-Davidson world,” said Brad Conn, marketing coordinator at an Indiana-based dealership that plans to sign up for the program.In the auto industry, according to J.D. Power, similar programs offer higher profit to dealers with faster inventory turnover. J.D. Power’s data also shows the programs are more effective in cultivating brand loyalty and tend to generate more business for the financial arms of automakers, which fund the vehicle purchases.James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the secondary motorcycle market has become a big business over the last decade and could be a “significant” revenue stream for Harley.In 2017, online retailer for pre-owned vehicles RumbleOn Inc pegged the value of the used motorcycle market in the United States at $7.5 billion a year, with Harley bikes accounting for more than half of sales. The study also showed customers aged 18-34 were buying three used Hogs for every new one.A booming demand for pre-owned Harleys until now has been a drag on the company’s U.S. retail sales, which have declined by nearly 40% since 2014.As its motorcycles do not wear out or go out of fashion quickly, used Harleys tend to be more in demand vis-à-vis pricey new models.Zeitz has tried to address the problem in the past year by tightening the supplies of new bikes. Leaner new inventory together with the increased demand for outdoor sports have driven up the prices of pre-owned bikes.Still, the company estimates there are 3 million unsold used Harleys in the United States, far more than the approximately 80,000 new bikes it shipped last year.“The biggest competition for a new Harley-Davidson bike is not an Indian bike or a Honda, or a Suzuki bike, but is a used Harley-Davidson bike,” said Hardiman.Faced with a similar situation in the 1990s, automakers launched certified programs to resell thousands of returned leased vehicles to first-time and budget-minded buyers.The programs allowed them to scrap less-expensive entry-level models, which had razor-thin profit margins, freeing up resources for more profitable products.Harley is pursuing similar goals. It has done away with some of the cheaper entry-level models and will ramp up investment in touring, large cruiser and trike bike segments that drive company profit.It is also looking to increase sales of ancillary products such as accessories, general merchandise and financial services by leveraging the certified bike program.Michael Uhlarik, founder and lead consultant at Motorcycle Global, reckons the certified program is aimed at replacing lost motorcycle revenue from falling shipments.Harley’s bike shipments to dealers in the United States have dropped more than 60% from the 206,000 units in 2008.“It will never be a 200,000 vehicle-a-year company,” said Uhlarik. “They have to replace that lost revenue somewhere.”(This story has been refiled to fix graphic link in 4th paragraph)",Reuters

475,"How Toyota thrives when the chips are down
Toyota may have pioneered the just-in-time manufacturing strategy but when it comes to chips, its decision to stockpile what have become key components in cars goes back a decade to the Fukushima disaster.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-fukushima-anniversary-toyota-in/how-toyota-thrives-when-the-chips-are-down-idUSKBN2B1005,"(Reuters) - Toyota may have pioneered the just-in-time manufacturing strategy but when it comes to chips, its decision to stockpile what have become key components in cars goes back a decade to the Fukushima disaster.After the catastrophe severed Toyota’s supply chains on March 11, 2011, the world’s biggest automaker realised the lead-time for semiconductors was way too long to cope with devastating shocks such as natural disasters.That’s why Toyota came up with a business continuity plan (BCP) that required suppliers to stockpile anywhere from two to six months’ worth of chips for the Japanese carmaker, depending on the time it takes from order to delivery, four sources said.And that’s why Toyota has so far been largely unscathed by a global shortage of semiconductors following a surge in demand for electrical goods under coronavirus lockdowns that has forced many rival automakers to suspend production, the sources said.“Toyota was, as far as we can tell, the only automaker properly equipped to deal with chip shortages,” said a person familiar with Harman International, which specialises in car audio systems, displays and driver assistance technology.Two of the sources who spoke to Reuters are Toyota engineers and the others are at companies involved in the chip business.Toyota surprised rivals and investors last month when it said its output would not be disrupted significantly by chip shortages even as Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Honda and Stellantis, among others, have been forced to slow or suspend some production.Toyota, meanwhile, has raised its vehicle output for the fiscal year ending this month and jacked up its full-year earnings forecast by 54%.The source familiar with Harman said the company, part of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, was experiencing shortages of central processing units (CPUs) and power management integrated circuits as early as November last year.While Harman doesn’t make chips, because of its continuity deal with Toyota, it was obliged to prioritise the carmaker and ensure it had enough semiconductors to maintain supplies of its digital systems for four months, or more, the source said.The chips in especially short supply now are microcontroller units (MCUs) which control an array of functions such as braking, acceleration, steering, ignition, combustion, tire pressure gauges and rain sensors, the four sources told Reuters.However, Toyota changed the way it buys MCUs and other microchips after the 2011 earthquake, which caused a tsunami that killed more than 22,000 people and triggered a deadly meltdown at Fukushima’s nuclear power plant.In the aftermath of the quake, Toyota estimated its procurement of more than 1,200 parts and materials might be affected and it drew up a list of 500 priority items that would need secure supply in the future, including semiconductors made by key Japanese chip supplier Renesas Electronics.The repercussions of the disaster were so severe it took six months for Toyota to get production outside Japan back to normal levels, having done so at home two months earlier.It was a big shock to Toyota’s just-in-time system because a smooth flow of components from suppliers to factories to assembly lines - as well as lean inventories - were central to its emergence as an industry leader for efficiency and quality.At a time when supply chain risk is now front and centre in almost every industry, the move shows how Toyota was ready to throw out its own rule book when it came to semiconductors - and is reaping the rewards.A Toyota spokesman said one of the goals of its lean inventories strategy was to become sensitive to inefficiencies and risks in supply chains, identify the most potentially damaging bottlenecks and figure out how to avoid them.“The BCP for us was a classic lean solution,” he said.Toyota pays for its stockpiling arrangement with chip suppliers by returning a portion of the cost cuts it demands from them each year during the life cycle of any car model under so-called annual cost-down programmes, the sources said.Inventories of MCU chips - which often combine multiple technologies, CPUs, flash memory and other devices - are held for Toyota by parts suppliers such as Denso, which is partially owned by Toyota Group, chip makers like Renesas and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and chip traders.While there are different kinds of MCUs, those in short supply now are not cutting-edge chips but more mainstream ones with semiconductor nodes ranging from 28 to 40 nanometres, the sources said.Toyota’s continuity plans for chips has also cushioned it from the impact of natural disasters exacerbated by climate change, such as fiercer typhoons and rain storms which often cause floods and landslides across Japan, including the southern Kyushu region manufacturing hub where Renesas also makes chips.One of the sources involved in semiconductor supply, said Toyota and its affiliates had become “extra risk averse and sensitive” to the impact of climate change. But natural disasters and are not the only threat on the horizon.Automakers fear there will be more disruptions to chip supplies because of rising demand as cars become more digital and electric, as well as fierce rivalry for chips from makers of smart phones to computers to aircraft to industrial robots.The sources said Toyota has another advantage over some rivals when it comes to chips thanks to its long-standing policy of ensuring it understands all the technology used in its cars, rather than relying on suppliers to provide “black boxes”.“This basic approach sets us apart,” said one of the sources, a Toyota engineer.“From what causes flaws in semiconductors to gory details about production processes like what gases and chemicals you use to make the process work, we understand the technology inside and out. It’s a different level of knowledge that you can’t simply gain if you’re just buying those technologies.”‘LOSING OUR GRIP?’There has been an explosion in the use of semiconductors and digital technologies by automakers this century thanks to the rise of hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as autonomous driving and connected car functions.Those innovations require even more computing power and use in part a new category of semiconductors called system on a chip, or SoC, which roughly speaking combines multiple CPUs on one logic board.The technology is so new and specialised many carmakers have left it to big parts suppliers to manage the risks.In keeping with its no black box approach, however, Toyota developed a deep in-house understanding of semiconductors to prepare for the launch of its successful Prius hybrid in 1997.Years before, it poached engineering talent from the chip industry and opened a semiconductor plant in 1989 to help design and manufacture MCUs used to control Prius powertrain systems.Toyota designed and manufactured its own MCUs and other chips for three decades until it transferred its chip-making plant to Denso in 2019 to consolidate the supplier’s operations.The four sources said Toyota’s early drive to develop a deep understanding of semiconductor design and manufacturing processes was a major reason why it has managed to avoid being hit by the shortages, in addition to its continuity contracts.Two of the sources, however, said they were worried the Denso deal might indicate that Toyota was finally willing to ditch its no black box approach, even though the supplier is part of the broader Toyota Group.“We were okay this time, but who knows what awaits us in the future?” one source said. “We may be losing our grip on technology in the name of technological development efficiency.”",Reuters

Aircraft leasing is poised for its biggest shake-up in almost a decade as its top two players, AerCap Holdings and General Electric Co's GECAS, discuss a deal to forge an industry titan with more than 2,000 jets, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

If the negotiations conclude successfully, an all-stock deal could come as early as this week, another of the sources added.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the possible deal, said the transaction could be worth $30 billion.GE said it did not comment on speculation. AerCap did not respond to requests for comment.New York-listed shares in Ireland’s AerCap ended trading on Monday with a gain of 13.2%. Shares of GE closed up 4.2%, compared with a decline of 0.5% in the S&P 500 Index.AerCap is the world’s largest owner of commercial aircraft, with 1,080 jets directly on its books or managed on behalf of others. GECAS has 984 aircraft owned or under management, according to UK-based consultancy IBA Group.The proposed tie-up would mark AerCap’s most ambitious expansion under tenacious Chief Executive Aengus Kelly, who in 2013 struck a deal to buy its largest rival, Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corp, after the financial crisis.It would also involve the latest move by GE Chief Executive Larry Culp to offload businesses and reduce debt since he took the reins of the struggling conglomerate in 2018. GE has already taken steps to reduce its exposure to aircraft financing.Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said the resulting behemoth would be the “mother of all leasing companies.”However, if a deal goes ahead, its sheer size could attract attention from antitrust regulators because AerCap and GECAS are already almost twice as big in fleet terms as the sector’s third-largest player, Dublin-based Avolon, analysts said.“The main question mark will be around the antitrust implications,” said Bertrand Grabowski, a former senior aviation banker turned independent adviser.“One option for AerCap will be to dispose of several hundred airplanes over time to comply with possible antitrust requirements,” he added.A mega-merger in leasing could also spur further consolidation in a sector that has featured multiple takeovers in recent years.“They will all be thinking there’s probably going to be more consolidation,” IBA Group President Phil Seymour said of smaller lessors, adding that this was the “natural impact of a down cycle.”Major leasing companies are eyeing growth as airlines focus on repairing balance sheets wrecked by the drop in air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though vaccines have prompted some talk of recovery.Singapore bank DBS Group said it expected aircraft lessors would largely emerge stronger from the crisis, but it warned that the weak finances of airlines meant some lessors would face extra problems collecting money from carriers or be forced to accept payment delays.Kelly last week told investors that the vast majority of AerCap’s customers were paying their bills.",Reuters

The Nasdaq is now down 10.6% from its Feb. 12 record close, or more than a 10% slide the market considers a correction.Shares related to finance, restaurants and travel rose on expectations those sectors will do well when the economy reopens, but they were unable to offset the weight of the bigger tech shares that dominate the U.S. stock market.After the stimulus bill won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for quick passage by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.But prospects of more government spending and a growing economy have stoked fears of an inflation spike, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs and weighing on technology shares that rely on cheap funding for growth.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday the package would fuel a “very strong” U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.As bonds yields have moved up, concerns about equity valuations for growth-oriented stocks and tech stocks specifically have weighed on the Nasdaq relentlessly the last three weeks, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.Stocks that will do well once people start traveling and eating out again have been leading the charge higher, James said.“People have been reallocating assets into those sectors. It’s been coming out of growth-tech to fund those purchases,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 306.14 points, or 0.97%, to 31,802.44, the S&P 500 lost 20.59 points, or 0.54%, to 3,821.35 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 310.99 points, or 2.41%, to 12,609.16.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.03 billion shares.The financial sector was the biggest boost in the S&P 500, hitting a record as higher market rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.The recent slide in the big tech stocks continued, with Apple Inc, Nvidia Corp, Tesla Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up. The divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,” Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. “The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,” he said.Banks added about 2% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.Walt Disney Co jumped about 6% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.GameStop Corp surged about 42% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 405 new highs and 28 new lows.",Reuters

I look forward to the committee and the Senate approving her nomination,” said Cassidy, in his introduction of Young to a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmation hearing.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats, including the Congressional Black Caucus, say that Young should replace Tanden as Biden’s nominee for director of the Office of Budget and Management.Tanden withdrew her nomination this week, after senators from both parties threatened not to vote for her because of her critical comments on Twitter.Young, who was the first Black woman to serve as the staff director for Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, could become the first Black woman to head the OMB.Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee wrote to Biden on Thursday urging him to nominate Young. “Shalanda Young has an impressive, lengthy record of hard work and smart budgeting across all of the federal departments and programs,” they wrote.The White House emphasized Thursday that Young wouldn’t automatically get the top job of gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget.Biden clearly thinks highly of Young and she would be acting director of the budget office if confirmed, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. However, she added, “There is a range of individuals in the country who are qualified for the job.”If Biden chooses another woman of color to head the Office of Management and Budget, and all remaining nominees are confirmed, his cabinet will be 46% female and 50% non-white, including Biden and Harris, according to Inclusive America, a non-profit that tracks diversity in government.",Reuters
479,Biden seeks dismissal of 'sanctuary' funding dispute at Supreme Court,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-immigration/biden-seeks-dismissal-of-sanctuary-funding-dispute-at-supreme-court-idUSKCN2AW2WN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s administration on Thursday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss three pending appeals on former President Donald Trump’s effort to withhold millions of dollars in law enforcement funds from states and cities that refused to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.Lawyers for jurisdictions challenging the order in the three cases said they agreed with the new administration that the cases should be dismissed. The three cases involve New York City, San Francisco and various states including California and New York.Biden, a Democrat, has rescinded the Republican Trump’s 2017 executive order that called on U.S. agencies to withhold federal funds from the so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, many of which are governed by Democrats. Lower courts were divided on whether the policy was lawful.Trump’s 2017 order conditioned receipt of federal funds by state and local governments on their giving U.S. immigration officials access to their jails, and advance notice when immigrants in the country illegally are being released from custody. It was one element of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and his battles with Democrats.The new administration has moved to reverse course on various Trump policies coming before the Supreme Court.The court last month canceled oral arguments in two other cases after the Biden administration changed course from Trump. Both were appeals by Trump’s administration - one defending his funding of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and the other defending his “remain in Mexico” asylum policy.The administration also has asked the court to cancel an upcoming argument on a policy introduced under Trump backing work requirements for people who receive healthcare under the Medicaid program for the poor.The administration last month told the justices the Obamacare healthcare law should be upheld, reversing the position taken under Trump.",Reuters
480,Iran casts long shadow over Pentagon nominee's Senate hearing,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-pentagon-kahl/iran-casts-long-shadow-over-pentagon-nominees-senate-hearing-idUSKCN2AW2TR,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s nominee to become the Pentagon’s top policy adviser faced relentless Republican criticism on Thursday over his support for the Iran nuclear deal, in a confirmation hearing that could foreshadow bigger fights over Biden’s national security agenda.Colin Kahl, who was a top aide to Biden during the Obama administration, reaffirmed his views on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, strong defense ties with Israel and the U.S. military’s so-called “triad” of nuclear missiles, submarines and bombers.But Republicans including their most senior member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jim Inhofe, lambasted Kahl over his past remarks about Iran and social media posts that were sharply critical of Donald Trump’s policies as president.“How can you reassure this committee that your hyper-partisan advocacy would not drive Pentagon decisions?” asked the senator from Oklahoma.Inhofe added that if he sounded a little upset, it was because “frankly, I am.”The Iran nuclear deal, aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, was fiercely opposed by Republicans and some Democrats, and Trump withdrew from it in 2018. Biden wants to revive the deal, which was agreed by Tehran and six major powers.Biden’s bid for diplomacy has been overshadowed in recent weeks by rocket attacks by Iran-backed militia on U.S. forces in Iraq that have triggered concerns about escalation.Kahl suggested he would favor strong responses to such attacks.“When Iran takes actions against our own forces, we should defend ourselves and punch back,” Kahl said.‘PROXY WAR’ Tensions in Kahl’s confirmation hearing echoed concerns raised on Wednesday, when a different Senate panel grilled Wendy Sherman over her nomination to be No. 2 official at the State Department. Sherman helped negotiate the 2015 Iran deal, and so is also likely to lose Republican votes.During Thursday’s hearing, Kahl defended his concerns about Trump’s 2018 pullout from the Iran deal and the decision to pile pressure on Tehran, including round after round of economic sanctions. Kahl at the time worried it would encourage Iran to increase its provocations and accelerate its nuclear program.“Both of those things have happened in the last three years. Iran is a lot closer to the fissile material required for a nuclear weapon than they were at the end of the Obama administration,” Kahl said. “And we’ve seen more attacks.”Republican Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa said she would not support Kahl’s nomination and that members of the U.S. military “deserve someone that will take a serious outlook to policy.” Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said Kahl’s hearing was being used by critics to re-litigate the 2015 agreement.“I really believe that the controversy over your nomination is essentially a proxy war,” Kaine said. “Republicans didn’t like the Iran deal.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton said Kahl had warned on Twitter of the risk of conflict with Iran after the Trump administration killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last year. He said Kahl had spent “the last four years warning about impending wars that never happened.”He also pointed to a tweet by Kahl describing Republicans as “the party of ethnic cleansing” after Trump abruptly ordered a Syria withdrawal in 2019 in a move that many said put at risk America’s Kurdish allies.Kahl apologized and said the last several years had been “pretty polarizing on social media.”“I’m sure there are times that I got swept up in that,” he said.",Reuters

The stock was up as much as 53% at the session high.Other stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets also rallied. Some market watchers cited the U.S. Senate’s passage of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill including $1,400 direct payments to Americans.“Maybe there’s a thought that if people are going to get a lot of money in their stimulus checks, that some of it’s going into the stock market,” said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. “Some of it might go into those same names that we saw in late January, those message board Reddit-type stocks.”Retail investors surveyed by Deutsche Bank last month said they would put more than a third of their stimulus checks into the stock market, which could represent inflows of around $170 billion, the bank said in a research note.Retail buying of stocks and options has been among the factors driving markets higher over the past year, analysts said. Some 53% of respondents in the Deutsche Bank survey said they invested some funds from past stimulus checks in the stock market.Other stocks popular on Reddit also soared, with AMC Entertainment up 15.4%, headphone maker Koss Corp climbing 27.5% and Rocket Companies up 3.0%.The U.S. government should be able to start delivering $1,400 checks almost immediately once the aid bill is finalized and President Joe Biden signs it, tax experts say.GameStop’s latest rally followed several wild swings in the share price from January. GameStop has become one of the hottest and most visible “meme stocks” followed on social media sites.Cohen, a major shareholder who has pushed Gametop’s move away from its brick-and-mortar model, joined the board in January shortly before a social media frenzy drove a meteoric rise in which GameStop shares surged more than 1,600%.Hedge funds that had bet against the stock were forced to unwind their short positions, a situation known as a “short squeeze.” GameStop pared most of those gains the following month.Some analysts believe another short squeeze may be adding fuel to the stock’s recent gains. Short interest in GameStop was valued at $1.9 billion, or 25.38% of the stock’s float on Monday, compared to 32.56% about a week ago, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.Over the past week, short bets worth $538 million were covered, Dusaniwsky said.“Shorts will continue to be squeezed out of their positions as GME’s stock price continues to trend upwards,” Dusaniwsky said in an email.Recently, Cohen posted a cryptic tweet of an ice-cream cone, which some analysts viewed as a possible trigger for GameStop’s most recent rally.Cohen’s RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop in January, giving Cohen seats on the company’s board.GameStop said its Strategic Planning and Capital committee will help drive the latest e-commerce push. Along with Cohen, the committee will include Alan Attal, a Chewy alumni who joined the board as part of the RC Ventures settlement, and another board member Kurt Wolf.GameStop’s sales through brick-and-mortar stores are under increasing pressure, as more customers gravitate toward digital downloads of console games.",Reuters

Neither EZ Lynk nor a lawyer for the defendants immediately responded to requests for comment.The lawsuit seeks civil penalties, including daily fines, for Clean Air Act violations, and an injunction against further EZ Lynk System sales and installations.Drivers can sometimes obtain faster acceleration and better fuel economy by using defeat devices.The U.S. government has stepped-up oversight of vehicle emissions after Volkswagen AG admitted in 2015 to intentionally evading emissions rules.

The signs are there for near-term inflation,” said Ellis Phifer, a market strategist at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee.“I don’t think it’s a long-term inflation issue yet. But near-term, all the signs and pressures are there. And the only thing fighting against it a bit is the stronger dollar.”On Wall Street, the Dow advanced while the Nasdaq shed over 2%.

The precise details of the complaint are not known.BaFin also suspended Greensill Bank’s operations saying there was an imminent risk it could become bankrupt. The German bank kept Greensill Capital’s short-term loans on its balance sheet before they were securitised and sold to Credit Suisse.Several German municipalities have flagged that they have put millions of euros into Greensill Bank, attracted by its lack of negative interest rates, and some are calling on the federal government to cover any losses.BaFin said an audit found that Greensill Bank could not provide evidence of receivables on its balance sheet purchased from GFG Alliance. GFG has not responded to requests for comment on BaFin’s findings.The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority has taken action against GFG’s own trade finance arm, Wyelands Bank, ordering it to repay all its depositors, without specifying why.GFG has declined to comment on the reasons.Allen & Overy represent Greensill and Kirkland & Ellis and Mayer Brown represent Apollo.",Reuters

Factors include authorization of unjustified amounts and ""criminal activity and/or diversion of cannabis"". (Graphic: Black markets plague Canadian cannabis, )In January, Ontario Provincial Police seized over 180,000 cannabis plants and numerous vehicles and firearms by raiding illegal cultivation facilities, many of which exploit Health Canada’s personal medical weed cultivation licenses.Under the rules, people using cannabis for medical purposes must get a daily amount authorized by medical care practitioners - doctors, nurses and social workers - to either be bought from official retailers or grown personally.Health Canada said in December it was seeing a surge in the amount of pot personal cultivators were being authorized to grow.The number of patients registered for purchase from federally licensed retailers was 377,024 in September last year, a 24% increase from June. Meanwhile, registrations for personal cultivation grew 29% over the period to 43,211.Even though personal cultivators remain a small fraction of overall patient registrations, these people are allowed to grow as much as 36 grams per day on average, compared with just 2 grams authorized for daily purchase from retailers. (Graphic: Canada's personal production authorizations surge, )As part of its public consultation, Health Canada said it was inviting Canadians to share their views on the factors that should be considered in “refusal or revocation of a registration on public health and public safety ground.”The consultation will run for 60 days through May 7, the regulator said.After the end of the two-month period, the regulator plans to finalize the guidance and make it public.",Reuters

Apollo Global Management Inc said on Monday it will merge with Athene Holding Ltd in an $11 billion all-stock deal, bringing in-house an annuities provider that helped turn it into one of the world's largest corporate credit investors.

Its existing stake in Athene did not contribute to earnings under accounting rules, despite representing 40% of Apollo’s assets under management and 30% of its fee-related income.A merger would allow Athene’s business and assets to be integrated into Apollo’s, providing both sides with enhanced earnings potential and a simpler ownership structure going forward, Marc Rowan, Apollo’s incoming chief executive officer, told an analysts call.“This transaction is about coordination, not consolidation. There is no plan to consolidate the businesses. There is no need to consolidate the businesses,” said Rowan, who helped set up Athene in 2009.Rowan, who co-founded Apollo 31 years ago, has been tasked with running the New York-based firm after board Chairman Leon Black said in January he would step down as chief executive by July, following an independent review of his ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Buyout firms have been increasingly focused on the insurance space, with KKR & Co, Blackstone Group and Sixth Street Partners all making significant acquisitions in the last year.Under terms of the deal, each outstanding class A common share of Athene will be exchanged for 1.149 shares of Apollo common stock, representing a premium of about 16.5% to Athene’s closing share price on Friday.The company’s shares were up 6.6% at $52.09 on Monday afternoon while Apollo shares were down 4.2% at $47.50.Existing Apollo shareholders will own about 76% of the combined company, and Athene investors will own the rest. The deal is expected to be completed in January 2022.Apollo also said the conflicts committee of its board has approved changes that would result in a simpler, more transparent corporate structure that is expected to be put in place by January 2022.The private equity firm said last month it would look in to changing its corporate governance structure, getting rid of shares with special voting rights that currently give Black and other co-founders effective control of the firm.Athene also serves as Apollo’s partner insurance company and had total assets worth $202.8 billion at the end of 2020, with operations in the United States, Bermuda, and Canada.",Reuters

Biden vowed to field a historically diverse team and has faced pressure from within his own ranks to live up to that promise in his administration’s early days.The new additions also come as the White House has been laying the groundwork for its second major spending bill, which it plans to unveil if it can shepherd Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill through congress this month. The Senate could vote on the bill as soon as this week.Meanwhile, on consumer protection issues, Biden has regularly turned to personnel like English whose views are aligned with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has advocated strict enforcement of the financial industry through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republican lawmakers largely regard the agency as too powerful and unaccountable.As a presidential candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion building climate-resilient homes, wiring cities for broadband internet, encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing electric vehicle charging stations, among other projects.He said the spending, paid for with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, would create millions of jobs for an economy reeling from the novel coronavirus pandemic while also shoring up the country’s resilience to climate change.Reynolds has studied topics including growing the domestic manufacturing base. Silverberg led the development of an $8 billion transit upgrade program at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.Biden and his transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, are expected to meet on Thursday afternoon with a bipartisan group of House of Representatives legislators on infrastructure.The White House has not specified how closely its legislative proposal will hew to the “Build Back Better” agenda Biden proposed as a candidate. Key decisions about the plan’s final cost and contents have not been finalized by his team, according to several people familiar with the plans.Infrastructure spending has backing in both parties.

His killing sparked weeks of nationwide and global protests, many of which were led by Black Lives Matter activists.“How many more people have to die, how many more people have to be brutalized on videotape” before police reforms become law, asked Democratic Representative Karen Bass, who wrote the legislation with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.The bill includes measures such as restricting certain funds to local governments that allow law enforcement officers to use choke holds, banning “no-knock warrants” that allow police officers to enter premises without announcing themselves and requiring law enforcement agencies to provide data on instances when police officers used deadly force.Bass said the bill would hold police “accountable” when constitutional rights are violated but would also support local law enforcement by fostering improvements in community policing, especially for minority neighborhoods.One of its most controversial provisions would change “qualified immunity” for police, further opening the door for lawsuits over the use of excessive force.Reuters in May 2020 published an investigation revealing how qualified immunity, with the Supreme Court’s continual refinements, had made it easier for police officers to kill or injure civilians with impunity.Conservative Republicans have attacked the Democratic bill, saying it would put law enforcement lives in danger and make communities less safe.The police reform effort sputtered in Congress last summer after the House passed the so-called George Floyd bill and Democrats blocked a Senate Republican bill.While the Republican bill also addressed issues such as police choke holds, no-knock warrants and use of police body cameras, Democrats complained it relied on incentives rather than mandating changes.Senator Tim Scott, the author of the Republican bill, told Reuters in a statement he welcomed conversations with Democrats over qualified immunity.",Reuters

Stocks at wholesalers gained 0.6% in December. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product also increased 1.3% in January.Inventories rose 0.6% in January from a year earlier. Sales at wholesalers jumped 4.9% after advancing 1.9% in December. At January’s sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.24 months to clear shelves. That was the shortest since November 2014 and was down from 1.29 months in December.Domestic demand is picking up after hitting a pothole late in the fourth quarter, driven by declining COVID-19 infections and nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief from the government. Consumer spending rebounded sharply in January after slumping in November and December.“Pent-up demand, particularly coming from middle- and high-income households who have been aggressively saving throughout the crisis, is set to drive consumption spending throughout the year as the health crisis begins to abate,” said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.Spending is likely to accelerate further if Congress, as expected, approves President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan. The bill, which was passed by the Senate on Saturday, will send onetime $1,400 checks to many low- and middle-income Americans as well as extend government-funded unemployment benefits for millions of people.Households have accumulated $1.8 trillion in excess savings.Economists estimate the economy could grow this year by as much as 7%, fueled by the massive fiscal stimulus and rollout of vaccines that are expected to get the pandemic under control. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic, helping to underpin manufacturing. But a big chunk of the inventory build is coming from imports, which could keep the trade deficit elevated.The government reported last week that imports of goods raced to a record high in January. Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts rebounded 1.2% in January. There were also increases in stocks of professional and computer equipment, as well as petroleum. Machinery inventory, however, fell.Wholesale goods sales were boosted by the automotive, professional equipment, computer equipment, machinery and petroleum categories.",Reuters

499,"From farming to finance, Greensill's crusade sparked supply chain reaction
Lex Greensill's mission to ""make finance fairer"" has taken him from the sugar cane fields of Bundaberg in Australia to the gold embossed halls of Buckingham Palace.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-greensill-ceo/from-farming-to-finance-greensills-crusade-sparked-supply-chain-reaction-idUSKBN2B01WI,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lex Greensill’s mission to “make finance fairer” has taken him from the sugar cane fields of Bundaberg in Australia to the gold embossed halls of Buckingham Palace.On Monday, it ended in bankruptcy proceedings. Greensill’s eponymous financial firm, once the centre of a multi-billion dollar lending empire that helped grease corporate supply chains, filed for insolvency.The sudden change in fortune came after Credit Suisse said $10 billion of funds that bought bonds backed by Greensill notes were shutting due to concerns over how some of the underlying assets were valued, depriving it of a key funding source.The insolvency proceedings and questions over valuations mark a stunning reversal for Greensill, who had attracted backers such as Japan’s SoftBank, advisers including former British Prime Minister David Cameron and who was named a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 2017.His firm, founded in 2011, helped companies manage their finances by paying suppliers on their behalf and collecting the money later on.Known in the industry as supply chain financing, this niche area took off in the wake of the financial crisis when banks were pulling back from lending to smaller firms and has generated handsome fees for lenders during the coronavirus crisis.Financial innovation - the repacking of invoices into bonds and selling them to investors - enabled Greensill to turbocharge his business and compete head on with major banks.But the strategy has also attracted controversy. Supply chain finance does not have the same disclosure requirements applied to more conventional forms of debt, creating what rating agency Moody’s has described as a “tiger trap” for investors.Germany’s financial regulator has said an audit of Greensill’s German Bank could not provide evidence of receivables on its balance sheet purchased from mining tycoon Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance. GFG has not responded to requests for comment on BaFin’s findings.Greensill Capital said in a statement in response to BaFin’s announcement that Greensill Bank always “seeks external legal and audit advice before booking any new asset.”Several German towns have already flagged that they put millions of euros into Greensill bank, attracted by its lack of negative interest rates, and are warning they are likely to lose it all.With his smart suits and wide grin, Greensill became the public face of the supply chain finance industry, setting up offices in New York, Chicago, Miami, Frankfurt, Bremen, and Sydney. According to its website, his firm extended $143 billion of financing to more than 10 million customers and suppliers in 175 countries in 2019.The idea for his business first began near Bundaberg, a town north of Brisbane in Australia renowned for its rum, where Lex's parents owned a small farm, Greensill said in a 2017 interview here with Sky News.The financing model was inspired by the hardship his parents endured while they often waited two years or more to be paid for the sugar cane and melons they produced.“We found ourselves under pressure from the big multinational companies who don’t always pay their bills on time,” Greensill said in the interview, adding that he had not continued his education to university because his parents could not afford to send him.The experience led Greensill to begin developing ideas on “how suppliers could access more efficient financing, regardless of their size and geographic location” his firm’s website says.As it expanded, Greensill drew backing from Japan’s SoftBank worth nearly $1.5 billion as well as funding from private equity firm General Atlantic, the company’s website shows.SoftBank and General Atlantic have declined to comment on Greensill’s troubles.Greensill’s crusade for fairer finance also put its jet-setting CEO on policymakers’ radars in the aftermath of the financial crisis as non-bank lending grew, and he advised Britain and the U.S. on the launch of their supply chain finance initiatives.The pinnacle of Greensill’s rise in British society came in 2017 with the awarding of the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) for services to the economy. He smiled as Prince Charles draped the medal around his neck.“Possibly the best thing about today was being able to take my mum to the palace from country Queensland,” Greensill told Sky News on the day he received the award.",Reuters
500,"Rush to bitcoin? Not so fast, say keepers of corporate coffers
When Elon Musk's Tesla became the biggest name to reveal it had added bitcoin to its coffers last month, many pundits were swift to call a corporate rush towards the booming cryptocurrency.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-bitcoin-treasury-insi/rush-to-bitcoin-not-so-fast-say-keepers-of-corporate-coffers-idUSKBN2B00FY,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Elon Musk’s Tesla became the biggest name to reveal it had added bitcoin to its coffers last month, many pundits were swift to call a corporate rush towards the booming cryptocurrency.Yet there’s unlikely to be a concerted crypto charge any time soon, say many finance executives and accountants loath to risk balance sheets and reputations on a highly volatile and unpredictable asset that confounds convention.“When I did my treasury exams, the thing we were told as number one objective is to guarantee security and liquidity of the balance sheet,” said Graham Robinson, a partner in international tax and treasury at PwC and adviser to the UK’s Association for Corporate Treasurers.“That is the fundamental problem with bitcoin, if those are the objectives for treasurers, then breaking them could get them in trouble.”Tesla Inc’s $1.5 billion bitcoin bet saw it join business software firm MicroStrategy Inc and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey’s payments company Square Inc in swapping some traditional cash reserves for the digital coin.Proponents of the cryptocurrency see it as a hedge against inflation at a time of unprecedented government stimulus, a falling dollar and record-low interest rates that make attractive high-yielding assets hard to find.While the moves have prompted more boardroom discussions though, headaches from bitcoin’s volatility to accounting for it and storing it are likely to preclude a big wave of companies holding large amounts on balance sheets in the short term, according to over a dozen financial officers, board members and accountants interviewed by Reuters.“It will take more than a small handful of disruptive companies investing in bitcoin to impact the narrative in boardrooms,” said Raul Fernandez, an entrepreneur and investor who sits on the audit committee of the board of chipmaker Broadcom Inc as well as other companies.“Larger global companies, I can’t see those conversations happening right now.”GRAPHIC: Betting on bitcoin -One problem could lie in the devil of the accounting detail in a bookkeeping industry that, like many others, is still taking stock of the nature of cryptocurrencies.The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards for U.S. corporations, does not have guidance specific to the accounting for cryptocurrencies. However, consistent with discussions among a separate U.S. trade body, companies apply existing FASB guidance on the accounting for “intangible assets”, which usually includes intellectual property, brand recognition or goodwill.Under these rules, companies other than investment firms or broker-dealers cannot book gains in the value of holdings should the price of bitcoin rise - but must write down their investment as an impairment charge if it falls.Furthermore, once a company writes down its holdings, it cannot record subsequent gains until it sells.By contrast, companies periodically reflect the impact of fluctuations in traditional currencies in their financial statements.The FASB has no immediate plans to review its treatment of bitcoin as the issue affects few of its constituents, according to a source familiar with the matter.“I don’t think it’s the best accounting so far,” said Robert Herz, a former FASB chairman. “I am hoping that if more mainstream companies get into bitcoin, the accounting standards board may revisit the accounting treatment.”Outside the United States, cryptocurrencies are usually treated as intangible assets too. But in contrast to guidance under the FASB rules, writedowns can be reversed in future years. In certain cases, companies can record bitcoin at market value. See EXPLAINER:Publicly listed companies together hold around $9 billion of bitcoin, data from the Bitcoin Treasuries website shows. Around 80% is held by Tesla and MicroStrategy, the latter with over $4.5 billion.Square, which allows users to buy and sell bitcoin, said last month it had added an additional $170 million of the virtual coin to its coffers.Of course, if the price of bitcoin rises, a company can always simply sell its holdings, thus realising some gains. Yet it is still a risky investment, given the cryptocurrency’s record of wild swings.In 2013, for example, bitcoin started at around $13 and spiked to over $1,000. In 2017, it went from about $1,000 to around $20,000. In early 2020, it sunk below $4,000. It fell more than 25% late last month only a week after hitting a record high above $58,000. It has now recovered part of its losses.About 5% of chief financial officers (CFOs) and senior finance leaders said they planned to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets in 2021, a survey of 77 executives by U.S. research firm Gartner found last month.Some 84% of respondents said they did not plan to ever hold it as a corporate asset, citing volatility as the top concern, followed by board risk aversion, slow adoption as a widespread method of payment and regulatory issues.“I think for the most part you will find companies will avoid that sort of thing,” said Jack McCullough, president of the CFO Leadership Council and a former CFO.“CFOs are likely to be very conservative in managing corporate treasuries. They’re happy sinking money into very safe places with low interest. Their job is to help grow the company through its operations, and the treasury needs to be safe and secure.”Cryptocurrency supporters, however, say the rationale for companies to buy bitcoin is clear, not least the decline of the dollar - the dominant reserve currency - which has fallen about 4.5% against a basket of major currencies in the past year.“The value of the dollar over time is getting weaker and weaker,” said Dave Sackett, CFO of ULVAC Technologies Inc, the U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese vacuum equipment maker, and an active cryptocurrency investor.“Bitcoin flips the script on that.”Sackett pitched ULVAC executives on investing in bitcoin last April, suggesting they take a chance and then cash out with potential gains. They passed on the opportunity, he said.Other potential headaches for executives include questions over how a company can safely hold a cryptocurrency, and how much it should disclose to shareholders about security precautions, said Tim Davis, principal in the financial and risk advisory practice at Deloitte & Touche, which advises firms on holding crypto on their balance sheets.High-profile thefts from exchanges have highlighted problems over safely storing digital assets. The loss of passwords for digital wallets is also a risk. Offline or “cold” storage is widely seen as the best defence against hackers but there are few, if any, regulatory standards.“Do you custody it yourself?” Davis said. “Do you have an exchange custody it? How much of it do you want to have in a hot wallet versus a cold wallet?”Ultimately, experts added, the expansion into bitcoin by companies without existing ties to the cryptocurrency market may depend on the willingness of financial executives to take on risk.“The general consensus among treasurers is that very few of them are going to follow this trend initially,” said Naresh Aggarwal at the UK’s Association for Corporate Treasurers.“As a treasurer, if I am right and the price doubles, the company may sell its holding and make a profit. Whilst the company may be worth more, it won’t be reflected in my compensation,” he added.“But if the price falls, I am pretty confident I will be fired. Why bother putting my neck on the line?”(This story fixes spelling in Robert Herz’s name)",Reuters

He has not been charged with a crime. Officials declined to say whether any other agents were present.Federal agents have charged more than 300 people so far with taking part in the riot, including several with connections to law enforcement. They include police officers from Texas and Virginia, a former New York City police officer and a retired FBI section chief who prosecutors allege plotted with a militia group to overrun the Capitol.Gaspari said Ibrahim was outside the Capitol because “it was a historic event.” She said he did not pass a set of metal barricades outside the building that were quickly overrun by the crowd.While members of the group smashed windows and rampaged through the Capitol, hunting for then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress, others fought with police outside, hitting them with flagpoles and dousing them in bear spray.“We’re walking a line between the First Amendment and insurrectionist behavior,” Gaspari said.Ibrahim worked in a DEA office in the Los Angeles suburbs. Gaspari said he had turned in his resignation before Jan. 6, but withdrew it before it took effect.DEA officials learned Ibrahim had been outside the Capitol after he sent photographs from his phone to a group chat of fellow agents. The agency took his weapons and credentials while it decides how to proceed.John Lavinsky, a spokesman for the Justice Department’s Inspector General, said he could not “confirm or deny the existence of investigations” but that the office was examining the Jan. 6 siege and had asked authorities to notify it about any allegations of misconduct by federal agents.",Reuters

506,Some Republican governors stand by mask mandates as Texas and Mississippi accelerate reopening,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/some-republican-governors-stand-by-mask-mandates-as-texas-and-mississippi-accelerate-reopening-idUSKCN2AV2ML,"(Reuters) - While Texas and Mississippi announced complete rollbacks of their states’ COVID-19 mitigation measures this week, several governors of other Republican states have made clear they are not abandoning their mask mandates despite political pressure.The sharp decline of new daily COVID-19 cases and the rollout of vaccines in the United States have prompted state and local governments to ease business restrictions in recent weeks, with movie theaters set to open at limited capacity in New York and indoor dining resuming in San Francisco on Friday. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR)However, the decline in cases plateaued last week with new infections rising in 29 out of 50 states compared with the prior week. Texas saw a 69% rise in cases in the week ended Feb. 28.Few of the rollbacks have been as sweeping as in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday said the state’s mask mandate would be lifted and most businesses could open at full capacity next week.The move drew immediate criticism from some politicians and public health experts who have urged caution while the nation’s vaccination program is still underway.President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that decisions to end the required wearing of masks - such as those made by Texas and Mississippi - amounted to “Neanderthal thinking” given the ongoing deaths being caused by the pandemic.“I think it’s a big mistake. Look, I hope everybody’s realized by now, these masks make a difference,” he told reporters.Public health experts agree face coverings are essential to slowing the spread of the virus, which has killed more than half a million Americans. But over the last year, resistance to public health measures in the United States, especially mask-wearing, has become politicized, with many Republican states enacting fewer and looser COVID-19 protocols than Democratic states.In some Republican-led states, including Florida and South Dakota, there has never been a statewide mask mandate. In others, like Alabama and Ohio, mask mandates remain in effect.Including the upcoming change in Texas, 34 states mandate that residents wear face masks in public, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.In Ohio, U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel on Wednesday called on Republican Governor Mike DeWine to follow Texas’ lead and repeal the statewide mask order. The governor quickly rejected the idea.“Ohio will be keeping its mask mandate to protect Ohioans who have yet to receive the vaccine. Vaccine supply is increasing, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the virus is still here and the pandemic is still ongoing today,” a spokesman for DeWine told Reuters in an email.Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Republican, said on Wednesday he was not ready to ease any restrictions, including an indoor mask mandate.“All businesses must continue to follow the safety guidelines,” Justice said.Abbott’s executive order in Texas will lift all mask requirements statewide as of March 10 and forbid local authorities from penalizing residents who do not wear face coverings. It will remove all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of hospitalizations.Local officials can still apply limits to businesses where hospitalizations remain high, according to the order, but are prohibited from mandating that they operate at less than 50% capacity.As of Monday, Texas was seeing about 7,500 new cases per day on a seven-day average, according to Reuters data, and it was ranked 47th in the list of states that have vaccinated the highest percentage of their populations.Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, on Tuesday also lifted his state’s mask order and removed all restrictions on businesses.But Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat in a majority Republican state, doubled down on his state’s mask order even as it increased capacity to 75% at restaurants and retail businesses on Wednesday.“Louisiana’s mask mandate is still in place,” Edwards tweeted. “As we vaccinate more and more people, masks are still our most effective tool in stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.”",Reuters

The COVID-19 pandemic has achieved what many mayors across Europe have tried and failed to do: wipe out tens of thousands of Airbnbs from city centres and so help lower rental costs for locals, in some places by as much as 15%. 
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbnb-europe-cities-insight/pandemic-tames-airbnb-in-europes-tourist-hotspots-for-now-idUSKBN2B014R,"LISBON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has achieved what many mayors across Europe have tried and failed to do: wipe out tens of thousands of Airbnbs from city centres and so help lower rental costs for locals, in some places by as much as 15%.While Europe’s cities have long welcomed tourists, critics say the surge of properties listed on short-lettings site Airbnb in recent years had priced many locals out of their own housing markets, turning historic neighbourhoods into soulless spaces.Property management companies and landlords contacted by Reuters in cities including Lisbon, Barcelona, Prague, and Venice said the collapse of tourism in the pandemic meant some hosts had now replaced holidaymakers with mid- to long-term tenants, moved in themselves, or given up properties altogether.Data from holiday rental analytics firm AirDNA showed the number of Airbnb listings with at least one night booked or available in the past month in Europe’s 50 largest cities plunged 21.9% year-on-year in 2020.Airbnb says it has adapted to changing travel patterns, with people heading to smaller towns and cities rather than tourist hotspots. “We had more listings in France, Germany, Portugal, Spain and the Czech Republic combined at the end of 2020 than the end of 2019,” spokesperson Andreu Castellano told Reuters.While some hosts in major European city destinations plan to return to Airbnb when tourists come back, others have left the holiday-let business for good.“If tourism had come back faster, maybe I wouldn’t have taken this decision. But I can’t go another year without a clear sense of when money is coming in,” said Vanessa Rola, 40, who was renting four apartments in Lisbon’s Graça district on travel platforms including Airbnb. Without tourists, she couldn’t pay her own rent, and is in the process of ending her contracts.In Venice, where AirDNA data showed year-on-year bookings for Airbnb and rival Vrbo combined were down 67% in January, residents’ activists are urging the government to seize the opportunity to help locals by, for example, capping rental days and converting empty space into low-cost housing.“Before the pandemic, renting in Venice had become almost impossible for normal people,” Marco Gasparinetti from residents’ rights group Gruppo 25 Aprile told Reuters, blaming short-term lets for pushing up prices. The city of just 60,000 residents is normally visited by 20 million tourists a year.“There are 30,000 people who commute to Venice every day but can’t afford to live here. Now that could change and help make sure Venice is not just an open-air theme park for tourists.”Graphic: Sliding market -Last month, Airbnb reported better-than-expected bookings in its first earnings release since going public, buoyed by countryside getaways and a rebound in demand in North America. Business was weakest in Europe, the Middle East and Africa amid COVID-19 lockdowns and travel curbs.For years, European mayors have struggled to rein in the proliferation of vacation properties in city centres, lacking the data to enforce limits on rental days or the number of properties in a building used for holiday lets.Airbnb, Expedia, Tripadvisor and Booking.com agreed last March to share data with the European Union’s statistics agency on the number of nights and guests booked, and 2020 figures are expected in the second half of this year, Eurostat said.Last September, 22 mayors wrote to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager urging her to extend data-sharing to city administrations, so they could “secure the liveability of our neighbourhoods.”“As tourism returns, we must make it sustainable - creating a model that isn’t prohibitive to holiday lets but does have limits which ensure this is a city you can visit, but also where you can live and work,” Ricardo Valente, a councillor in Porto - one of the signatory cities - told Reuters.But COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions on cross-border travel are doing the job for some city authorities – at least for now.Graphic: Airbnb available listings -In Lisbon, which saw huge growth in Airbnbs in the historic centre, around 5,000 of the city’s roughly 25,000 listings have disappeared from the website during the pandemic, according to website Inside Airbnb.Rental prices fell by 15% between March and December 2020, according to real estate database Confidencial Imobiliario, attributed largely to the sudden availability of thousands of former holiday lets.In Prague, Airbnb listings tumbled from just over 14,500 to less than 8,000, according to Inside Airbnb. Rents have fallen by around 8%, real estate developer Trigema reported.“I was losing $20,000 a month, and regulation was making things very complicated,” said Ondrej, a landlord in Prague who has sold his two Airbnb flats and given up the three he was renting to sublet.“The Airbnb boom is over.”Airbnb, however, says it has proved resilient amid shifting demand. “Guests are getting out of city centres and booking whole homes,” Castellano said. “The Airbnb platform inherently adapts to where demand is ... we adapt to guests’ needs.”Not everyone in city centres is giving up. Data from Portugal shows that while thousands of properties have fallen off Airbnb, just 114 have given up their holiday-let licence – a coveted asset in the city’s historic districts, where the local council prohibited new licences from being issued in 2019.Programmes attempting to lure Airbnb owners onto the social housing market through tax incentives and the promise of a five-year contract have so far seen slow uptake: just 34 properties in Lisbon and 12 in Porto, the city councils said.Instead, some landlords are using local letting websites or their own direct booking channels to find longer-term tenants.Airbnb released three videos last month entitled “Made Possible By Hosts”, widely seen as an attempt to woo back those who had left the platform.But for some, the wait is unaffordable. AirDNA data showed forward bookings in Rome, Lisbon and Budapest were 85-90% below last year’s levels at the end of March. By contrast, bookings across U.S. holiday rental platforms were just 2% below last year, their data showed.Eduardo Miranda, head of Portugal’s holiday let association, expects around 15% of Airbnbs to stay off the market in Lisbon for good, even when tourism returns.  “This is going to be another year of sacrifice,” Miranda said. “The best of this summer will be lost. And if the summer is lost, the year is lost. Those who stay in the business will be the ones who really care.”",Reuters

President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the U.S. Interior Department, U.S. Representative Deb Haaland, secured backing from a moderate Republican senator on Wednesday, further paving her way to confirmation.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-interior-haaland/bidens-interior-secretary-pick-haaland-secures-republican-support-idUSKBN2AV1O1,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the U.S. Interior Department, U.S. Representative Deb Haaland, secured backing from a moderate Republican senator on Wednesday, further paving her way to confirmation.The support from Senator Susan Collins of Maine comes one week after West Virginia’s Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would vote to confirm Haaland, who is poised to become the nation’s first Native American in a presidential Cabinet post.Their backing is key in the 50-50 split U.S. Senate, in which Biden needs every Democrat on board to push his nominees through, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting any tie-breaking vote. Collins’ support allows extra breathing room should another Democrat oppose the nomination.Manchin and Collins earlier rejected Biden’s proposed budget director, Neera Tanden, whose nomination was yanked on Tuesday.The two senators acknowledged the differ with Haaland on some issues, but praised her vow to work with both political parties.Collins, in her statement on Wednesday, also cited “Haaland’s willingness to support issues important to the State of Maine, such as Acadia National Park, as well as her deep knowledge of tribal issues.”The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is expected to vote on Haaland’s nomination on Thursday. If approved, it would move to the full Senate for a vote.Tensions were raised at her confirmation hearing last week as Republicans targeted her past opposition to fossil fuel projects and Biden’s agenda to combat climate change.The Interior Department oversees the nation’s vast public lands and waters, including 500 million acres of federal and tribal lands as well as offshore federal waters.",Reuters
518,Biden withdraws Tanden's nomination to be White House budget chief,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-omb/biden-withdraws-tandens-nomination-to-be-white-house-budget-chief-idUSKCN2AU2TL,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday withdrew the nomination of Neera Tanden to be his budget director after she ran into stiff opposition over tweets that upset lawmakers, in the first Capitol Hill rebuff of one of his nominees.“I have accepted Neera Tanden’s request to withdraw her name from nomination for director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Biden said in a short statement on Tuesday.The decision to withdraw Tanden’s nomination reflected the tenuous hold his Democrats have on the Senate.With the Senate split 50-50, Vice President Kamala Harris could have cast a tie-breaking vote in Tanden’s favor. But that was not an option after moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would not vote to approve the think tank director.Manchin’s defection had sent the White House - and Tanden - scrambling to find one Republican backer. But they ultimately came up empty-handed, even after a last-minute meeting with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski on Monday.Her backers decried what they called a hypocritical and sexist push to punish Tanden for harsh tweets directed at both Democrats and Republicans, after four years of similar language used by Republican former President Donald Trump.Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, tweeted: “Disheartening. For salty tweets. After what we’ve been through for 4 years.”Biden said he still planned to have Tanden - a confidante of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton - serve in his administration, but did not say which job she might get.Tanden, 50, an Indian American, would have been the first woman of color to lead the OMB, which manages the $4 trillion federal budget.Shalanda Young, Biden’s pick for the No. 2 OMB job, has won the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus to replace Tanden. A former staffer in the House of Representatives, Young would be the second Black woman in Biden’s Cabinet if she were to become OMB director.In an interview with CNN prior to the announcement that Tanden was withdrawing her nomination, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said Young did “really, really well” during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday for the deputy’s post.Asked if he would support her for the top job, Sanders said: “Ms. Young made a very strong presentation today. ... But it is the function of the president of the United States to make that nomination, not me.”Other possible candidates include former National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and Ann O’Leary, another former aide to Hillary Clinton. Biden’s transition team had discussed both for possible roles in the administration.In a letter released by the White House, Tanden told Biden her nomination had become more than an uphill climb.“Unfortunately, it now seems clear that there is no path forward to gain confirmation, and I do not want continued consideration of my nomination to be a distraction from your other priorities,” Tanden said.Tanden, who served in the administrations of Democratic former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, repeatedly apologized for her harsh tweets during her confirmation hearings, but ultimately was unable to convince senators she had the right personality to lead the OMB.She had taken aim at lawmakers across the political spectrum, including Sanders, and in 2016 criticized Manchin’s daughter, then the chief executive of pharmaceutical firm Mylan, after the company raised prices for its anti-allergy EpiPen.To shore up support, Tanden met with 46 different senators, advocacy groups, the business community, labor unions and faith leaders, even winning endorsements from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Communications Workers of America and others.",Reuters
519,South Dakota legislative leaders seek to suspend impeachment of attorney general,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-south-dakota-ravnsborg-impeach/south-dakota-legislative-leaders-seek-to-suspend-impeachment-of-attorney-general-idUSKCN2AV08I,"PIERRE, S.D. (Reuters) - Leaders of South Dakota’s legislature said on Tuesday they would push to suspend impeachment action against Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over his conduct in a fatal car crash until criminal charges lodged against him are resolved.Calls for Ravnsborg’s ouster mounted last month after state authorities took the extraordinary step of releasing video of police interrogations of the attorney general and other evidence from the Sept. 12 incident, in which his car struck and killed a man walking along a highway.As shown in the video, Ravnsborg told police he believed he had run into a deer, rather than a person, until he returned to the scene the following day to find the body of the victim, 55-year-old Joe Boever, lying in a roadside ditch.Investigators suggested that Ravnsborg’s account lacked credibility, telling him under questioning that a broken pair of eyeglasses belonging to Boever were found in his car, meaning the victim’s face had gone through the windshield on impact.Police also told Ravnsborg that Boever had been carrying a flashlight, which was still illuminated when they found it the next day, and that evidence showed Ravnsborg’s car had driven onto the shoulder of the road where the victim was walking.The video sparked immediate outrage. Governor Kristi Noem demanded the resignation of Ravnsborg, a fellow Republican facing three misdemeanor charges in the accident. A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced an impeachment resolution in the state’s Republican-controlled House of Representatives.But dynamics changed after a state judge last week ruled that public posting of investigative evidence violated Ravnsborg’s rights to a fair trial and ordered such material in the criminal probe sealed.In a joint statement on Tuesday, House Speaker Spencer Gosch and other legislative leaders called for halting impeachment proceedings at least until “the courts have concluded their business” in the case.“Our proceedings need to be fair and transparent,” Gosch said, adding that in light of last week’s court order, “we have some concerns on what our abilities are in a public proceeding.”The suspension was expected to be adopted by a House committee as an amendment to the impeachment resolution on Wednesday.The announcement came nearly six months after the deadly nighttime crash, which occurred near Highmore, as the attorney general was driving home to Pierre, the state capital, from a fundraiser. Highmore is about 50 miles east of Pierre.Ravnsborg insisted he never saw anyone by the side of the road, never saw a light in the pitch dark, and was so startled by the collision that he was focused on pulling his car safely to the side of the road.Ravnsborg also denied veering onto the shoulder of the road before the collision. He said he was setting the vehicle on cruise-control when the crash occurred and was not distracted with his cellphone or other devices.Toxicology tests released by state authorities showed no evidence of impairment.",Reuters

521,"Game of drones: Chinese giant DJI hit by U.S. tensions, staff defections
Chinese drone giant DJI Technology Co Ltd built up such a successful U.S. business over the past decade that it almost drove all competitors out of the market.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tech-dji-insight/game-of-drones-chinese-giant-dji-hit-by-u-s-tensions-staff-defections-idUSKBN2AZ0PV,"SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Chinese drone giant DJI Technology Co Ltd built up such a successful U.S. business over the past decade that it almost drove all competitors out of the market.Yet its North American operations have been hit by internal ructions in recent weeks and months, with a raft of staff cuts and departures, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees.The loss of key managers, some of who have joined rivals, has compounded problems caused by U.S. government restrictions on Chinese companies, and raised the once-remote prospect of DJI’s dominance being eroded, said four of the people, including two senior executives who were at the company until late 2020.About a third of DJI’s 200-strong team in the region was laid off or resigned last year, from offices in Palo Alto, Burbank and New York, according to three former and one current employee.In February this year, DJI’s head of U.S. R&D left and the company laid off the remaining R&D staff, numbering roughly 10 people, at its flagship U.S. research centre in California’s Palo Alto, four people said.DJI, founded and run by billionaire Frank Wang, said it made the difficult decision to reduce staffing in Palo Alto to reflect the company’s “evolving needs”.“We thank the affected employees for their contributions and remain committed to our customers and partners,” it said, adding that its North American sales were growing strongly.“Despite misleading claims from competitors, our enterprise customers understand how DJI products provide robust data security. Despite gossip from anonymous sources, DJI is committed to serving the North American market.”It did not comment on the other U.S. staff departures that current and ex-employees spoke of, although it told Reuters last year its global structure was becoming “unwieldy to manage”.DJI, which has become a symbol of Chinese innovation since it was founded in 2006, is one of dozens of companies caught in the crossfire of trade and diplomatic hostilities between Washington and Beijing, like Huawei and Bytedance.Staff sources and competitors say the company’s brand reach, technical know-how, manufacturing might and sales force mean it won’t lose its crown anytime soon in the multi-billion-dollar U.S. and global markets for non-military drones.But a December order adding the company to the U.S. Commerce Department’s “Entity List” along with the closure of its R&D operation in California could affect its ability to serve the needs of U.S. customers, according to three former senior executives and two competitors.The Commerce Department listing, enacted over allegations including DJI enabled “high-technology surveillance”, prohibits the company from buying or using U.S. technology or components.The same month, Romeo Durscher, DJI’s U.S.-based head of public safety, who had played a central role in building the company’s business in providing drone technology to non-military U.S. government departments and agencies, left his job.Durscher, a former NASA project manager and an influential figure in the drone industry, now works at Swiss company Auterion, a competitor to DJI.He said he left DJI because he was disheartened by the staff cuts and what he described as internal power struggles between the U.S. team and its China headquarters. He added that the U.S. reorganisation complicated the task in dealing with the fallout from U.S.-China tensions and winning government business.“It’s not an easy decision to leave the market leader that’s really far ahead of everyone else,” said Durscher, who joined DJI in 2014. “But those internal battles were distracting from the real purpose and in 2020 it got worse ... we lost tremendous talent at DJI and that’s very unfortunate.”Privately held DJI doesn’t publish sales figures. The U.S. Department of Defense estimated the American non-military market was worth $4.2 billion last year. Consultancy DroneAnalyst said DJI controlled almost 90% of the consumer market in North America and over 70% of the industrial market.The December listing by the Commerce Department, and the prohibition on buying U.S. parts, may impact the firm’s mobile apps, web servers and some battery and imaging products, said David Benowitz, head of research at DroneAnalyst and a senior figure with DJI’s enterprise team, which works with industrial customers, in Shenzhen before he left last summer.DJI said in December that the ban would not affect U.S. customers’ ability to buy and use its products.The listing followed other official blows. In October, the U.S. Department of the Interior said it would only buy drones from companies okayed by the Department of Defense, which last August published a list of five approved drone suppliers to the federal government - four American and one French.DJI said there was no “broad-based U.S. government ban on purchasing DJI drones”.“Congress considered that approach last year and rejected it, because ... such a ban would be challenging for many companies and government bodies that rely on drones,” it added.‘WE’RE STILL PRIMITIVE’Benowitz said persisting U.S.-China tensions and the push by Washington to support DJI’s rivals could see the company’s North American market share decline. He added that, while the federal government comprised a relatively small part of DJI’s business, its restrictions could have a “chilling effect”, with other buyers worried about tougher measures in the future.“We’re at a point where there are too many market opportunities for one player to dominate,” he said.Yet he added alternatives to DJI were relative minnows, though both policy support and security concerns over Chinese drones had brought them growth in the last year. Competitors to DJI include France’s Parrot and California-based Skydio.Chris Roberts, CEO of Parrot Inc, Americas, said 2020 had been a significant year for the company in the United States, having been named an approved supplier by the Defense Department and won business from emergency services and security agencies.Skydio announced $170 million in D-round funding last week and said it had a valuation of over $1 billion.“DJI makes good hardware but we are still very early in the market, and very primitive compared to what ultimately should exist,” Skydio CEO Adam Bry told Reuters.When Durscher joined DJI back in 2014, the company’s Phantom series was transforming drones from a niche hobby to a mainstream gadget. He said he was particularly drawn by the chance to bring drones into the kit of fire and rescue departments.He said the technological advances of smaller rivals in the last year were tempting for some public-safety agencies, who might say “let’s go with this drone now so we don’t have to deal with the data security”.He added that change could come as government departments and companies looked to replace drone fleets that are nearing the end of their life cycles.A fleet is typically expected to last three to four years, according to Benowitz.Durscher and several other staff compared DJI’s internal rivalry over projects to “Game of Thrones”, the TV series where rival factions vie for power. He said this resulted in a rotating door of Shenzhen bosses, and that he reported to 12 different managers in his six years at the company.Durscher’s departure from DJI followed those of other key executives in North America last year, including director of business development Cynthia Huang.Huang, who now works with Durscher at Auterion, said she became increasingly frustrated because she felt DJI wasn’t able to meet all the growing demands of the enterprise market. Additionally, she said, job cuts over the past year added to the reasons she decided to leave. The losses in Palo Alto, Burbank and New York had followed cuts made to DJI’s global sales and marketing teams, which Reuters reported in August.“Some of the people that we lost in those layoffs, it didn’t make sense,” said Huang, who was hired in 2018 to take the lead in building DJI’s enterprise business in North America. “The continued exodus of talent was discouraging.”",Reuters

Large companies from carmaker Tesla Inc to business intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc have swapped billions of dollars in cash for bitcoin in recent months.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-bitcoin-treasury-expl/explainer-bitcoin-on-your-balance-sheet-heres-what-you-need-to-know-idUSKBN2B00FP,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large companies from carmaker Tesla Inc to business intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc have swapped billions of dollars in cash for bitcoin in recent months.Yet hurdles remain for the quick dawn of a wider trend of major corporations holding bitcoin, from the cryptocurrency’s volatility to reputational risk, financial chiefs and accountants told Reuters. Main story:Here are some of the key questions over cryptocurrency bookkeeping and tax:The bookkeeping rules used by U.S. companies make no specific reference to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.Under guidance from 2019 issued by the U.S. accounting trade body, companies account for bitcoin under rules for “intangible assets” such as intellectual property.Companies record the value of bitcoin at the time of purchase in their accounts. If the price rises, they cannot log those gains until they sell. Yet if the value of bitcoin drops, the company must write down the value of their holdings as an impairment charge.Outside the United States, where companies operate under a separate set of rules, crypto is accounted for differently.Companies that own digital coins for sale as part of their normal business hold them as inventories at cost price. Others, such as broker-traders, can hold such inventories at market value, said the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which sets rules for most non-U.S. corporations.Other companies hold their cryptocurrencies as intangible assets, like in the United States. Yet they can reverse any writedowns back to original cost if the value of the coin rises again. In some other cases, companies that record crypto as intangible assets can gauge the value of their crypto holdings at market value.Most of the publicly listed companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets are specialist cryptocurrency or blockchain firms, according to Bitcoin Treasuries bitcointreasuries.org.But last month, Tesla became the highest-profile mainstream company to shift some of its coffers to bitcoin from cash, making a $1.5 billion bet on the digital currency.In a regulatory filing, it said the bitcoin would be accounted for as “indefinite-lived intangible assets”, warning it could face impairment charges if their price falls.MicroStrategy Inc, led by bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor, holds around 91,000 bitcoin. Its holdings are worth around $4.6 billion, according to a Reuters calculation.It analyses bitcoin prices on cryptocurrency exchanges each quarter, with any fall in the value of the asset after their purchase leading to an impairment charge, according to a securities filing last month.Payments firm Square Inc has also converted large chunks of its balance sheet into bitcoin, with boss Jack Dorsey promising to “double down” on its commitment to the cryptocurrency.Square says it will recognise any decreases in market prices below the original cost as an impairment charge but, in line with accounting standards, will not mark up the value if the price increases.In its most recent regulatory filings, Square goes into detail about some of the security and custody risks involving bitcoin. It listed losing access as an operational risk, with a hack or data loss potentially harming trust in the company.It also counted bitcoin volatility and impairment among its legal, regulatory and compliance risks.Cryptocurrencies are treated as property under federal U.S. tax rules.Companies can be liable for capital gains tax whenever they sell a cryptocurrency. The amount paid depends on how long they have held the coin and the market value at the time of the transaction.MicroStrategy warned in a filing to U.S. regulators last month that it could face a tax bill for any gains it made from selling bitcoin and that “such tax liability could be material”.Other major countries follow similar rules.In Britain, for example, the type of tax paid for trading digital currencies or accepting payment in crypto depends on who is involved in the business, according to the UK tax agency.Such activity will likely incur capital gains tax, corporation tax or other duties, it said.(This story refiles to correct typo in headline)",Reuters

Financial strains on Texas city-owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives and the grid operator has spurred calls for state aid and lured private equity firms into plans to fix multi-billion-dollar charges.

The charges have driven one co-op into bankruptcy and left two dozen others facing bills they will be hard-pressed to cover without outside help.Several private equity firms have been in talks with the operator of the Texas electric grid to provide it financial support, four people familiar with the talks told Reuters.The grid acts as a clearing house, collecting from electric marketers including municipals and co-ops and paying generators usually within four days. When defaults occur, it spreads the shortfall to other grid users, adding pressure to those able to pay their own bills.It remains unclear what form this funding would take and whether Texas officials would agree to an offer from private equity firms. The buyout firms would likely provide a loan or bond which would cover the near-term cash needs of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the people said.ERCOT spokeswoman Leslie Sopko declined comment on financing options under consideration.It was unclear whether the private equity talks would yield any agreement. The dialogue has been hampered by a power vacuum left by top-level departures at ERCOT and the state regulator, some of the people said. There are also disputes over whether the state could use its emergency funds bail out providers.Rating agencies are warning that, absent a government financial rescue plan, significant borrowing will be needed. Rayburn Electric, a north Texas co-op that serves 225,000 customers, said its weekly power costs soared more than 900 times. Residential customers that normally pay $150 per month face more than $3,200 bills without some reduction, Chief Executive David Naylor said.Taking money from private equity and infrastructure funds would be one alternative to a state-led bailout. Another would be for ERCOT to sell bonds backed by future fees, delaying an immediate cash call.San Antonio’s municipal utility, the largest in the country, owes about $1 billion for gas and electricity purchased during the storm. The company – CPS Energy – has said it plans to seek $500 million in financing and may consider future legal remedies as a way to recover some of those costs.Credit ratings firms warned of downgrades on dozens of rural electric co-ops and municipal utilities that have outstanding debt, moves that would raise their future debt costs.“It could be politically challenging and it could be difficult to raise rates to recover these costs,” said Dennis Pidherny managing director at Fitch Ratings.Texas power regulators on Friday vetoed requests by private electric providers and a recommendation by the state’s market adviser to rescind rates and fees mistakenly levied.But officials may have to take a different tack when it comes to municipal providers and rural co-ops, officials said, because of their number and clout. The two groups have more than 3.5 million customers in the state combined, a Reuters tally shows.“I don’t think we want a wave of municipal bankruptcies,” said state Senator Nathan Johnson, (D-Dallas). “At a minimum we’re going to have to find a way to stretch out the time period over which losses can be amortized or recovered. At a minimum.”One of the state’s largest utilities, Vistra Corp, on Friday recommended any state bailout for the groups include a provision breaking the municipal providers’ lock on supplying their communities.",Reuters

Not doing so risks accelerating the selloff.Almost a year ago markets, already alarmed by COVID-19, took fright at ECB President Christine Lagarde’s off-the-cuff remark that the bank wasn’t there to “close spreads”. Soaring yields forced the ECB to respond with the PEPP.The anniversary is a reminder to the ECB: it never hurts to show markets now and then not to push it too far.GRAPHIC: Move in 10-year sovereign bond yields this year -Premier Li Keqiang kicked off the annual, week-long National People’s Congress (NPC) with his 2021 report, restoring China’s annual economic growth target set for above 6% this year.But the bigger question is how does Beijing withdraw pandemic stimulus and avoid asset bubbles without upsetting the economy and twitchy financial markets.Chinese stocks and government bonds sank last week after its top banking regulator warned of bubbles overseas and rising lending rates.Data on Sunday showing February exports grew at a record pace from a year earlier when COVID-19 battered the world’s second-biggest economy while imports rose less sharply did little to move the needle. Money supply data due out later this week will be scrutinised for froth levels in the banking system.GRAPHIC: China TSF, GDP and markets -After the slide in tech stocks, one fund that bears watching is Cathie Wood's $23 billion ARK Innovation fund ARKK.P which has fallen more than the market in recent days. Wood shot to prominence with outsized bets on companies such as Tesla and Square that surged during the pandemic. Lipper data shows she attracted $14.84 billion in inflows over the past 12 months. But tech companies are acutely sensitive to higher bond yields, leaving the ARK fund -- and others like it -- vulnerable to a performance hit and outflows. Wood’s heavy exposure to illiquid stocks could turn out to be an issue.GRAPHIC: ARK Innovation's holdings hammered in Nasdaq drop -European and U.S. equity returns are running neck-and-neck in 2021 but after five years of underperformance, European stocks may have just enough tailwind to win the 2021 race.The old continent being light on tech, isn’t on the front line of the bond selloff which has hit the rate-sensitive Nasdaq. In fact, for investors seeking to ride the reflation trade, Europe ticks a lot of boxes, being heavy with commodities, financials and other value stocks.U.S. 10-year Treasury yields around 1.5% match the S&P 500’s dividend yield.

The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and one topic will dominate: what to do about rising sovereign bond yields which if left unchecked could derail efforts to get a coronavirus-hit economy back on track.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-markets-ecb/lets-talk-about-bonds-five-questions-for-the-ecb-idUSKBN2B00JL,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and one topic will dominate: what to do about rising sovereign bond yields which if left unchecked could derail efforts to get a coronavirus-hit economy back on track.Germany’s 10-year borrowing costs jumped 26 basis points in February, the biggest monthly rise in over three years, with similar moves seen across the euro area.Policymakers from president Christine Lagarde to chief economist Philip Lane have expressed unease. Markets want to know the game plan.Here are five key questions on the radar.1. What will the ECB do to contain rising bond yields?The ECB shouldn’t hesitate to lift bond buying volumes and use the full firepower of the 1.85 trillion euro ($2.2 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) if needed, says board member Fabio Panetta.Economists agree but policymakers are divided. Just under 1 trillion euros of the PEPP is still unused. Buying slowed recently, perhaps due to technical factors.Still higher government borrowing costs, threatening to spill over to corporates and consumers, create a headache for an ECB grappling with a weak economy.“Is the ECB fully aware of the risks?,” said ING Research global head of macro Carsten Brzeski. “And if they are, are they willing to be more precise about what they are prepared to do -- will they act with advanced PEPP purchases?”GRAPHIC: The ECB's pandemic stimulus programme -2) What exactly is the ECB watching to assess financial conditions?Lagarde will be pressed for clarity on this.She has voiced concern about rising nominal yields. Remarks from other officials and the last ECB minutes put emphasis on the real or inflation-adjusted component of yields as a key determinant of financial conditions.Both have risen this year, but real yields less so.Lane focuses on the GDP-weighted sovereign yield curve and the overnight index swap (OIS) curve.A clearer idea of which is key would give markets a better sense of policymakers’ pain threshold.GRAPHIC: Which yield is key? -3) How far does the ECB expect inflation to rise this year?Accelerating inflation, which could exceed the near 2% target in coming months, means the ECB will likely increase its 2021 inflation forecast.Lagarde may stress that a recent pick-up in prices is driven by one-off factors and should fall back.But there are differing opinions among policymakers. Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann believes the ECB will have to “act accordingly” if inflation rises.“There are more mixed views on inflation - ECB staff and Lane think inflation is subdued but this is not shared by the hawks, with Weidmann recently highlighting that German inflation was likely to go through 3% this year,” said Jacob Nell, head of European economics at Morgan Stanley.GRAPHIC: Accelerating inflation? -4) What will the ECB say about the economic outlook?Economists expect the medium-term outlook to remain broadly unchanged, with a recovery forecast in the second half of 2021.Lagarde, however, may stress short-term downside risks as the bloc battles the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns.The economy is almost certainly in a double-dip recession as the services industry suffers, but hopes for a wider vaccine rollout has driven optimism to a three-year peak, a survey showed last week.GRAPHIC: Euro zone economic surprises stay positive in 2021 -5) Is the ECB relieved that Draghi is Italian PM?Lagarde is unlikely to comment on politics in Italy, where her predecessor Mario Draghi just became prime minister. But a fall in Italian borrowing costs on his appointment is good news and eases pressure on the ECB.The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap narrowed to the tightest levels since 2015 in February; recent bond turbulence hasn’t hurt too much.The trusted Draghi has promised sweeping reforms to revitalise a battered economy. His strongly pro-European stance is seen as a positive for Italy and the euro project.GRAPHIC: Italian bond spread during the COVID-19 crisis -",Reuters
527,"White House cites 'active threat,' urges action despite Microsoft patch
The White House on Sunday urged computer network operators to take further steps to gauge whether their systems were targeted amid a hack of Microsoft Corp's Outlook email program, saying a recent software patch still left serious vulnerabilities.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-microsoft/white-house-cites-active-threat-urges-action-despite-microsoft-patch-idUSKBN2AZ0OQ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Sunday urged computer network operators to take further steps to gauge whether their systems were targeted amid a hack of Microsoft Corp’s Outlook email program, saying a recent software patch still left serious vulnerabilities.“This is an active threat still developing and we urge network operators to take it very seriously,” a White House official said, adding that top U.S. security officials were working to decide what next steps to take following the breach.CNN on Sunday separately reported the Biden administration was forming a task force to address the hack. The White House official, in a statement, said the administration was making “a whole of government response.”While Microsoft released a patch last week to shore up flaws in its email software, the remedy still leaves open a so-called back door that can allow access to compromised servers and perpetuating further attacks by others.“We can’t stress enough that patching and mitigation is not remediation if the servers have already been compromised, and it is essential that any organization with a vulnerable server take measures to determine if they were already targeted,” the White House official said.Already, a source told Reuters more than 20,000 U.S. organizations had been compromised by the hack, which Microsoft has blamed on China, although Beijing denies any role.The back channels for remote access can impact credit unions, town governments and small business, and have left U.S. officials scrambling to reach victims, with the FBI on Sunday urging them to contact the law enforcement agency.Those affected appear to host Web versions of Microsoft’s email program Outlook on their own machines instead of cloud providers, possibly sparing many major companies and federal government agencies, records from the investigation suggest.A Microsoft representative on Sunday said it was working with the government and others to help guide customers, and the company urged impacted clients to apply software updates as soon as possible.Neither the company nor the White House has specified the scale of the hack. Microsoft initially said it was limited, but the White House last week expressed concern about the potential for “a large number of victims.”So far, only a small percentage of infected networks have been compromised through the back door, the source previously told Reuters, but more attacks are expected.",Reuters
528,"China's shift away from 5-year targets increases policy flexibility: official
China's decision not to set an economic growth target for its new five-year plan will give policymakers more room to account for uncertainties and respond to changes, a senior state planner official said on Monday.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-economy-ning/chinas-shift-away-from-5-year-targets-increases-policy-flexibility-official-idUSKBN2B00DL,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s decision not to set an economic growth target for its new five-year plan will give policymakers more room to account for uncertainties and respond to changes, a senior state planner official said on Monday.In its 2021-2025 economic plan delivered to the nation’s legislature on Friday, China did not include any average annual growth targets, unlike the previous five-year plan issued in 2016.It did, however, pledge to keep growth in a “reasonable” range over the five-year period and set an annual gross domestic product target of above 6% for the current year, having dropped the 2020 target last year amid global uncertainties caused by the pandemic.Hu Zucai, vice director of the National Development and Reform Commission, said on Monday predicting growth for an annual period contingent on the circumstances would be easier than setting targets over a five-year period.“By not setting a specific and quantitative (five-year) growth target, we will be more proactive, active and at ease in coping with all sorts of risks, which is conducive to boost the flexibility of our development,” Hu told a press conference on the sidelines of the annual parliament meeting. He added that it also helps to guide agencies to focus on improving the quality of efficiency of growth, instead of just numerical growth.“We are confident that GDP will maintain a certain level (over the next five years),” he said.Hu said Beijing’s targets for unemployment and energy and carbon intensity in 2021-2025 are linked to GDP, suggesting growth was targeted to stay in line with its potential rate.He did not specify the potential rate, a gauge of the economy’s growth when inflation and unemployment conditions are stable, although some analysts estimate it to be around 5%.China aims to keep its jobless rate within 5.5% in 2021-2025 and cut energy intensity by 13.5% over the period.Some Chinese policy adviser estimates show China needs to maintain average annual growth of at least 4.7% in the next 15 years to bring the GDP per capita in line with that in moderately developed countries, a longer-term target outlined by the Chinese leadership.The world’s second-biggest economy expanded 2.3% last year, the only major economy to report growth, although the growth was its weakest in 44 years, dragger lower by still weak consumption and soft investment demand.China is confident of achieving its 2021 economic targets, Ning Jizhe, another NDRC vice head told the same briefing, adding that the economy in January-February period continued the steady recovery trend since the second quarter last year when China started to lift COVID-related lockdowns.But Ning cautioned against risks and challenges facing the economy this year, citing a “grim and complicated” global picture.“The foundation of domestic economic recovery is not firm enough, residents’ consumption is still restricted and investment growth lacks driving force,” he said, adding that small firms are facing many difficulties.The economy is widely expected by economists to grow more than 8% in 2021, led by an expected double-digit expansion in the first quarter, but analysts say the pace is driven by a low base for comparison and the recovery remains uneven.",Reuters

Three Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a wide-ranging climate bill on Tuesday that embraces President Joe Biden's goals to curb climate change including decarbonizing the electric grid by 2035.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-climate-house/democrats-in-u-s-house-introduce-wide-ranging-climate-bill-idUSKCN2AU2JQ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives unveiled a wide-ranging climate bill on Tuesday that embraces President Joe Biden’s goals to curb climate change including decarbonizing the electric grid by 2035.Introduced by Representatives Frank Pallone, Paul Tonko and Bobby Rush, and incorporating input from the Biden administration, the bill includes a federal clean electricity standard requiring a percentage of retail power sales to come from sources that produce little or no carbon emissions.The Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s Future Act, or CLEAN, requires 80% clean electricity by 2030 and 100% by 2035.The power could come from sources including wind, solar and existing nuclear energy. That could provide a boost to nuclear power, an industry experiencing shutdowns amid low prices for natural gas, a competing fuel.The bill also sets a goal of a fully decarbonized economy by 2050.On transportation, the largest source of carbon emissions, the bill authorizes $100 million annually from fiscal 2022 to 2031 for entities that install publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) supply equipment. It also requires the energy secretary to establish a program to help determine where EV charging stations are needed and expands EV access in disadvantaged communities.The legislation, which needs to pass committees and then the full House and Senate and be signed by Biden before becoming law, does not include a carbon tax, a mechanism supported by some Republicans and companies.“The votes are just not there for a price on carbon,” also known as a carbon tax, Pallone told reporters. He said a carbon price had concerns from an environmental justice perspective because it could allow industries to keep polluting as long as they buy permits from entities that have cut emissions elsewhere.“It’s time to try something new,” Pallone said, noting that carbon tax plans failed in Congress most recently in 2009/2010. Tonko, who prefers a carbon tax, called a clean energy standard “achievable.”Three Republican representatives, including David McKinley from coal-producing West Virginia, said the bill’s mandates would raise energy prices and make the country more reliant on Chinese critical mineral supplies.They want policies to “capture all the advantages of our abundant resources, which include coal, hydropower, nuclear technologies, and clean natural gas.”Another climate bill from McKinley, and Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, includes a less ambitious goal of requiring utilities to cut emissions 80% by 2050. Pallone said his bill could be adjusted to draw Republican support.Given the thinnest possible Democratic majority in the Senate, Pallone suggested that senators could try to pass the bill under budget reconciliation in that chamber. That process requires only 51 votes instead of 60 in the 100-member Senate.",Reuters
531,"U.S. House to consider $15 minimum wage in 'near future,' leader says",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-wage/u-s-house-to-consider-15-minimum-wage-in-near-future-leader-says-idUSKBN2AU239,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday the U.S. House of Representatives will take up legislation soon to raise the minimum wage to $15 over five years, after Senate rules blocked including the proposal in a COVID-19 relief bill before Congress.Democrats and some Republicans have voiced support for the idea of raising the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, for the first time since 2009, although they disagree on how much. Raising the hourly wage to $15 was a campaign promise of Democratic President Joe Biden.“The minimum wage as it now stands is immoral,” Hoyer, a Democrat, told reporters.In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters a minimum wage increase along the lines that Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney have proposed was “worth discussing,” but not a hike to $15. Cotton and Romney say the hourly wage could be gradually raised to $10.Democrats had hoped to get a minimum wage increase to $15 included in a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, which is currently being advanced under a process that allows it to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes normally required in the Senate. But the Senate’s rules expert said no.So the House will bring the $15 wage proposal to the floor “in the near future,” Hoyer said, without giving specifics.Hoyer said Democrats will have to work with Republicans to get the wage hike passed, because right now there are not 60 votes in the Senate for boosting the minimum wage. Democrats and their allies have 50 votes in the Senate.“We’re going to send that over to the Senate, and hope ... there are 10 (Republican) senators who believe that having people work for $7.25 an hour and in poverty after 40 hours of workweek is not right in America,” he said.",Reuters

It also helps negotiate trade agreements and enforces laws on trade and national security.At her confirmation hearing, Raimondo vowed to protect U.S. telecommunications networks from Chinese companies. But she refused to commit to keeping telecommunications company Huawei Technologies on a U.S. economic blacklist.The Commerce Department under former President Donald Trump took aim at China on numerous fronts, adding dozens of Chinese companies to a trade blacklist, including Huawei, the country’s top chipmaker SMIC, Hikvision and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology.In written responses to lawmakers, Raimondo said she had “no reason to believe” that the listed Chinese companies should not be.“We should have no illusions about China’s objectives, which I believe are to undercut America’s longstanding technological advantage and to displace America as the global leader in cutting-edge research and development and the industries of the future,” she said.Raimondo inherits the Trump administration’s unsuccessful effort to bar U.S. app stores run by Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned TikTok or WeChat for download. The Justice Department last month put appeals of rulings blocking those efforts on hold pending a Biden administration review of the efforts.",Reuters

COVID-19 insurance policies are increasingly joining passports and sunscreen as vacation staples, creating opportunities for insurers as more countries require mandatory coverage in case visitors fall ill from the coronavirus.
MAR 07 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-travel-insurance/covid-19-travel-insurance-becoming-a-vacation-staple-idUSKBN2AZ0DV,"(Reuters) - COVID-19 insurance policies are increasingly joining passports and sunscreen as vacation staples, creating opportunities for insurers as more countries require mandatory coverage in case visitors fall ill from the coronavirus.Airline bookings are on the rise in some regions, driving cautious hopes of a revival in summer traffic, but also raising fears among tourist destinations of getting hit with bills should vacationers become stranded by the virus.More than a dozen countries from Aruba to Thailand require COVID-19 coverage for visitors, with Jordan the latest to consider such protections, organizers of an emergency services plan told Reuters.The market for all types of COVID-19 travel coverage is estimated to be between $30 billion to $40 billion a year, according to travel insurance consultant Robyn Ingle, with companies like AXA and AIG underwriting protection.But a surge in demand for COVID-19 coverage also means insurers could be on the hook for big payouts should another wave of infections lead to large numbers of cancellations or tourists getting sick.“Travel insurance and protection services are taking off at pace with travel as it resumes, said Dan Richards, chief executive for travel risk and crisis management firm Global Rescue.COVID-19 insurance benefits typically cover treatment up to $100,000, and could include coronavirus testing costs and services like evacuation or local burial or cremation. These benefits, introduced by insurers in mid-2020, are sold either as add-ons or as separate policies with coverage for illness or quarantine.Jeremy Murchland, president of Indiana-based travel insurance company Seven Corners, said travelers are now “more likely to insure their trips,” as more countries require COVID-19 coverage.A travel insurance plan that includes trip protection, medical expense coverage for COVID-19 and protection for baggage and personal effects typically costs 4% to 8% of the dollar value of the trip, Murchland said.While the pandemic has battered travel, demand for coverage has created opportunity for the hard-hit insurance industry and a niche to develop new products, companies said.For example in June, Seven Corners introduced an optional medical travel plan with coverage for coronavirus expenses, Murchland said. By year’s end, the product with coronavirus coverage generated about 80% of total medical travel plan sales.Seven Corners also saw a 20% rise in travelers buying highly priced “cancel for any reason” policies in 2020. The policies cover cancellation costs related to the virus.Some countries have mandated travel insurance for incoming visitors – either by including it in their entry or visa fees or by requiring proof of coverage, said insurer World Nomads.Jordan is evaluating whether to require a mandatory flat fee for visitors as part of a program from Global Rescue and the Global Travel and Tourism Resilience Council, said council co-chair Taleb Rifai. The program, which costs up to $100 per person, covers certain disasters and illnesses like COVID-19.Jordan’s Tourism Bureau was not available for comment.It is not clear how coverage demand will evolve as many more people become inoculated against the coronavirus with vaccines.Frank Comito, a special advisor to the Caribbean Hotel and Tourism Association, said some budget travelers have complained about mandatory coverage. And some countries could discontinue or relax the requirement as “we move away from the pandemic.”Rifai, former secretary general of the UN’s World Tourism Organization, said he expects countries will continue requiring coverage as the vaccines “will take years” to roll out globally.",Reuters

Texas' state power regulator on Friday unanimously vetoed a request to cut about $16 billion from state power charges during the final day of the state's February cold snap, saying even a partial repricing could have unintended effects.

Both proposals were recommended by the state’s independent power market adviser.Total electricity charges jumped by about $47 billion during a winter storm that knocked out nearly half of Texas power plants, hiking prices for gas and power that have roiled the state’s energy sector. Storm-related costs sent one company into bankruptcy and a dozen more face being unplugged from the state’s grid for non-payment.“The PUC choose to ignore the recommendation of the economists hired by the state to advise regulators,” Brandon Young, chief executive of Payless Power, an electricity marketer, said in an interview. “As a result, $16 billion in costs are being passed to all electric providers -retail electric, municipal providers and cooperatives.”The state’s grid operator had raised power prices to $9,000 per megawatt hour, to induce power plant operator to increase power or stay running for five days. However, that 450-times-the-usual price remained in place after the emergency passed, adding about $16 billion to the total.State market adviser Carrie Bivens described that final day’s pricing as a mistake by grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), recommending the PUC “correct ERCOT’s real time prices.”Revising prices could hurt the companies that had hedged their power costs and result in greater uncertainty, said commissioners.“Decisions were made about these prices in real time based on information available to everybody,” said PUC Chairman Arthur D’Andrea. “It is impossible to unscramble.”The mistake and fees charged for standby power service that were provided sparked a firestorm of protests by the dozens of companies that market electricity in Texas. Commissioners on Friday deferred a vote on Bivens’ call for reducing ancillary services fees, saying there was no reason to rush.Vistra Corp, a power plant operator that receives some of the fees, argued it was unfair for regulators to cherry pick “certain prices,” for a rollback. The ancillary services commissioners are considering cutting would not reduce residential bills, it said.“It would be inappropriate for the Commission to just reprice ancillary services without addressing the other pricing issues and challenges,” wrote Amanda J. Frazier, a Vistra senior vice president in a letter to the commission.Federal and state investigators are examining why the state and utilities were unprepared for a deep freeze that left up to 4.3 million Texans without power, heat and water. Consumers will see higher prices as the storm costs get passed down through rate increases or fewer choices in providers, officials said.",Reuters

He wants it to be very big and he feels that this is the key to the recovery package.”Graves said the infrastructure plan must be bipartisan and that a funding mechanism was needed.“It cannot be a ‘my way or the highway’ approach like last Congress,” Graves said, referring to previous Democratic legislation. “A highway bill cannot grow into a multi-trillion dollar catch-all bill, or it will lose Republican support.”Biden last month met with a bipartisan groups of senators on infrastructure.Democrats narrowly control both the House and Senate. Biden’s Republican predecessor Donald Trump failed to agree with lawmakers on a major bill to repair and replace aging and dangerous bridges, airports, water pipes and other projects.As a presidential candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion in fixing highways, bridges and airports; building climate-resilient homes; wiring cities for broadband internet; and encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing electric vehicle charging stations.",Reuters

California health officials set new rules on Friday that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1, after a closure of nearly a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.
MAR 06 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-theme-parks/disneyland-other-california-theme-parks-stadiums-could-reopen-april-1-idUSKBN2AX2M5,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California health officials set new rules on Friday that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1, after a closure of nearly a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.But the return of Mickey Mouse to the “Happiest Place on Earth” and live spectators to the California ball parks of America’s favorite pastime still come with major caveats.Theme and amusement parks would be permitted to restart on April 1 with severely limited capacity, but only if the counties where they operate are removed from the “purple” tier of California’s color-coded COVID-19 restrictions, the system’s most stringent classification.Masks and other safety measures would still be required, and the parks initially would be open only to state residents. Attendance would range from 15% to 35% of normal capacity.Outdoor stadiums, ball parks and performance arenas would also be allowed to welcome back live audiences starting April 1, though at a fraction of maximum seating and subject to the same tiered system of constraints.Opening day turnouts for Major League Baseball games would be muted affairs in Southern California, with no more than 100 spectators allowed in venues located in purple-zoned counties.That would include the stadiums of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the San Diego Padres and the Anaheim Angels. San Francisco and Oakland, home of the Giants and the Athletics, respectively, are currently designated red, which would limit seating to 20% capacity.The changes in California, a leading U.S. epicenter of the pandemic during a year-end holiday surge of cases that strained healthcare systems to the breaking point, come as the rate of infections across the country has slowed and vaccinations are on the rise.But state health officials have charted a cautious reopening approach even as Governor Gavin Newsom has come under mounting political pressure, including the threat of a recall election, to relax restrictions on the state’s social and economic life.Walt Disney Co’s Anaheim-based Disneyland lies in the heart of Orange County, which like neighboring Los Angeles and San Diego counties, has remained purple for months, a designation that the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and infection rates are dangerously high.On Thursday, Newsom announced a “modest loosening” of tier definitions by factoring in the increasing vaccinations within vulnerable communities.This would allow counties designated purple, for example, to progress more quickly to the red tier, where amusement and theme parks were previously ordered closed.Friday’s announcement means theme parks in red-zoned counties could reopen at 15% capacity on April 1. The less restrictive orange and yellow tiers would allow reopenings at 25% and 35% capacity, respectively.Ken Potrock, president of the Disneyland Resort, said in a statement that the decision meant “getting thousands of people back to work and greatly helping neighboring businesses and our entire community.”But it remained unclear whether rising vaccinations and falling COVID infection rates would go far enough for Anaheim to reach red by the first of next month. And Potrock did not give a date for a Disneyland reopening.California-based baseball teams issued similar statements welcoming Friday’s announcement and the hope that conditions will allow limited numbers of fans back in stadiums next month.Disney in September said it was furloughing some 28,000 workers, mostly across its U.S. theme parks in California and Florida. Walt Disney World in Florida reopened last July with limited capacity.Dodger Stadium and a Disneyland parking lot are currently being used as mass-vaccination sites.Theme parks such as Disneyland, Universal Studios, Legoland and Knott’s Berry Farm protested strongly last October when California health officials ruled out any quick reopening of their attractions.",Reuters

543,"New York Governor Cuomo hires defense lawyer in nursing home probe
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has retained a prominent white-collar criminal defense lawyer to represent his office in a federal investigation into the state's misreporting of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents, a spokesman said on Monday.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-cuomo/new-york-governor-cuomo-hires-defense-lawyer-in-nursing-home-probe-idUSKCN2AT3NJ,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has retained a prominent white-collar criminal defense lawyer to represent his office in a federal investigation into the state’s misreporting of COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents, a spokesman said on Monday.Cuomo has come under fire in recent weeks over his office’s role in reporting the official count of coronavirus fatalities among patients of nursing and extended-care facilities, as well as for allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him.Elkan Abramowitz, a former federal prosecutor now working in private practice in New York City, was hired to represent Cuomo’s “executive chamber” - consisting of the governor and his immediate staff - in the U.S. Justice Department inquiry into the COVID-19 nursing home deaths, senior advisor Rich Azzopardi told Reuters in a text message.Azzopardi earlier told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported Abramowitz’s appointment, that Cuomo had not hired a lawyer in connection with the sexual harassment probe.Cuomo, one of the nation’s best-known Democraticpoliticians, has been accused by two former aides of engaging in a series of unwanted, sexually suggestive comments, and in one case an unsolicited kiss.On Sunday, he apologized if any of his remarks or behavior were misinterpreted as flirtatious and said he never tried to make anyone feel uncomfortable. He said he never physically touched anyone.New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday said she had accepted the governor’s formal referral of the matter to her office, clearing the way for appointment of an outside counsel to conduct an investigation into the accounts of both women - Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett.Late on Monday, a third woman, Anna Ruch, came forward in an interview published by the New York Times to accuse the governor of inappropriate conduct at a September 2019 wedding reception.As reported by the Times, Ruch recounted the governor first put his hand on her bare lower back, then when she brushed his hand away, called her “aggressive” and placed his hands on her cheeks and asked her if he could kiss her.Ruch, according to the Times, said she pulled away and the encounter left her feeling “confused and shocked and embarrassed.” The moment was caught in a cellphone photo Ruch said was taken by a friend and published by the Times with the article.Reuters was unable to independently verify Ruch’s account. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful. A representative for Cuomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The New York governor’s brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, told viewers late on Monday he could not cover stories surrounding the allegations on the governor due their relation.“Obviously, I’m aware of what’s going on with my brother,” the CNN host said on Monday. “Obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother. Now, of course CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so.”The often outspoken governor has stayed mostly out of the public eye since the sexual harassment scandal started gaining traction last week. Cuomo rose to national prominence for his daily televised briefings last spring, when New York was the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.In January, the attorney general’s office issued a report that cast doubt on the Cuomo administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying the state health department significantly undercounted the death toll in nursing homes and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.Before entering private practice, Abramowitz worked as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where he served as chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney’s office.Abramowitz represented Cuomo’s office when federal prosecutors investigated the governor for disbanding an anti-corruption agency in 2014. He also represented filmmaker Woody Allen for many years, defending him against abuse allegations.",Reuters

Biden’s fellow Democrats have a majority in the House, but the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, where the measure would need support from all 50 members of that party caucus, plus 10 Republicans.Republicans have said the law would take powers away from states and raise fraud concerns.Democrats have been fighting to expand access to the polls through early voting, vote-by-mail and other measures, efforts that expanded as the coronavirus pandemic raged.Republicans have been fighting those efforts and pursuing measures to curb access to the polls. Former President Donald Trump, in his first public speech after his stinging Nov. 3 election loss to Biden, on Sunday proposed limiting absentee voting and days when Americans can vote.Biden beat Trump by more than 7 million votes in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats enjoy an advantage over Republicans in voter party affiliation.Trump never conceded the loss, and some of his supporters violently contested Congress’ certification of Biden’s win at the Capitol in a deadly Jan. 6 riot.Since then, dozens of local Republican lawmakers have introduced bills that would limit voting in states across the country.Georgia’s House of Representatives on Monday approved a bill that restricts ballot drop boxes and limits early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches. If passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate and signed into law by Republican Governor Brian Kemp, the measure could be devastating for Black voters, activists have said.A fight is also brewing over the forthcoming redrawing of a map that determines which areas of the country are represented by which House member. In many states that process is led by state legislatures, which are mostly controlled by Republicans.Legislatures have historically redrawn the borders in ways that helped their party win more elections, sometimes minimizing the influence of Black voters.The House bill would turn much of that authority over to commissions that Republicans have said would not be accountable to citizens in their states.",Reuters
545,Senate to debate COVID-19 bill this week after Democrats retreat on minimum wage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/senate-to-debate-covid-19-bill-this-week-after-democrats-retreat-on-minimum-wage-idUSKCN2AT228,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will start debating President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill this week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday after Democrats backed down from an effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 as part of it.The backpedaling did not end hopes of addressing the minimum wage issue in Congress. Democrats and some Republicans have voiced support for the idea of raising the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, for the first time since 2009, although they disagree on how much.Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton last week proposed an increase to $10 per hour, but said employers should verify the wage is going to workers who are legally in the United States.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives early on Saturday narrowly approved the COVID-19 package, one of Biden’s top priorities. The House bill included the minimum wage hike.Democrats aim to pass the legislation in the Senate trough a maneuver known as “reconciliation,” which would allow the bill to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes normally required by that chamber’s rules.Senate debate on the COVID-19 bill could begin as early as Wednesday, a Senate Democratic aide said.Senate Democrats over the weekend gave up on the idea of trying to pass the minimum wage hike by adding tax penalties to the COVID-19 bill, after earlier being told that Senate rules governing “reconciliation” prevented them including a straight-up wage hike to the legislation.There are also political hurdles. Some moderate Democrats, including Senator Joe Manchin, have rejected the $15 figure as too high and suggested an $11 target could be more realistic.“We worked through the weekend and it became clear that finalizing ‘plan B’ with the caucus would delay passage and risk going over the jobless benefits cliff on March 14,” one source said. Democrats want the COVID-19 bill signed into law by March 14, when enhanced unemployment benefits expire.A group of House progressives urged Biden on Monday to overrule the Senate parliamentarian, who determined last week that the $15 proposal could not pass by reconciliation.“This ruling is a bridge too far,” said Democratic Representative Ro Khanna. “If we don’t overrule the Senate parliamentarian, we are condoning poverty wages for millions of Americans.”The White House has previously ruled out intervening.Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said on Monday night he would introduce an amendment to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 in the final reconciliation bill, adding he believed the Senate should ignore the parliamentarian’s advice.“I am not sure, however, that my view at this point is the majority view in the Democratic Caucus,” Sanders said in a statement.The Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, told reporters that lawmakers should look for another venue to raise the minimum wage, but that “if it takes some 60 votes or a supermajority of some kind, it’s going to be very difficult, obviously.”To pass the relief plan, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris may have to cast a tie-breaking vote in a chamber where Republicans control 50 seats and Democrats and their allies control the other 50. Even that outcome depends on all the Democrats staying united behind the first major bill to come through Congress in the Biden administration.Democrats say the package is needed to fight a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Biden met with nine Senate Democrats on the coronavirus relief bill on Monday. One of them, Senator Jon Tester, told reporters they discussed “targeting” the funds in the legislation.“At least from my perspective, it wasn’t talking about reducing it, just targeting the money,” said Tester.Republicans in Congress, who broadly backed COVID-19 relief spending early in the pandemic, say the relief plan is too expensive and includes things like transportation projects that have nothing to do with relief for COVID-19. They also do not like the $35 billion included for pumping up government subsidies to defray the cost of premiums in the Obamacare health insurance program.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the measure on Monday as a “bonanza of partisan spending” that poorly targets the needs of American families, devotes only 1% of its spending to vaccines, delays the bulk of its school aid until after 2021 and includes policies that would drag down the economy.“This is where we are: a bad process, a bad bill, and a missed opportunity to do right by working families,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech.The Democratic measure includes funding to track the virus and distribute vaccines, and sends a new round of aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments.The big-ticket items include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, a $400-per-week federal unemployment benefit through Aug. 29 and help for those in difficulty paying rents and home mortgages during the pandemic.",Reuters

A U.S. agency investigating Facebook Inc for racial bias in hiring and promotions has designated the probe as ""systemic,"" attorneys for three job applicants and a manager who claim the company discriminated against them told Reuters on Friday.
MAR 06 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-workers-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-agency-probes-facebook-for-systemic-racial-bias-in-hiring-promotions-idUSKBN2AY006,"(Reuters) - A U.S. agency investigating Facebook Inc for racial bias in hiring and promotions has designated the probe as “systemic,” attorneys for three job applicants and a manager who claim the company discriminated against them told Reuters on Friday.A “systemic” probe means the agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, suspects company policies may be contributing to widespread discrimination.The EEOC typically resolves disputes through mediation or allowing complainants to sue employers. But agency officials designate a few cases “systemic,” enabling investigators to rope in specialists to analyze company data and potentially bring a broader lawsuit representing entire classes of workers.Facebook operations program manager Oscar Veneszee Jr. and two applicants denied jobs brought a charge last July to the EEOC, and a third rejected applicant joined the case in December. They have alleged Facebook discriminates against Black candidates and employees by relying on subjective evaluations and promoting problematic racial stereotypes.The designation of the EEOC’s probe has not been previously reported.The EEOC has not brought allegations against Facebook. Its investigation, which may last months more, may not result in findings of wrongdoing. The agency declined to comment.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to comment on the status of the probe or specific allegations but said that “it is essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment.”“We take any allegations of discrimination seriously and investigate every case,” he said.The EEOC brought in systemic investigators by last August and received detailed briefing papers from both sides over the last four months, said Peter Romer-Friedman, an attorney at Gupta Wessler representing Veneszee and the job candidates.Employment law firms Mehri & Skalet and Katz Marshall & Banks also are helping the workers.The EEOC’s Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Washington offices are involved, attorneys from the firms said.Facebook’s counsel, Covington & Burling, did not respond to a request for comment.Increasing racial and gender diversity has been a persistent challenge for the nation’s largest tech companies, which at times have blamed a shortage of qualified candidates from underrepresented groups. But tech workers have grown emboldened to publicly challenge that notion and allege in formal complaints that biased employment practices cause disparities.Romer-Friedman said he and his colleagues told the EEOC in a submission last month that one such Facebook policy is awarding employees bonuses of up to $5,000 when a candidate they refer is hired. Referred candidates tend to reflect the makeup of existing employees, disadvantaging Black professionals, he said.Facebook said about 3.9% of its U.S. employees as of last June were Black.David Lopez, a former EEOC general counsel now teaching at Rutgers University, said that systemic investigations are significant because of the additional resources involved. When they result in allegations of wrongdoing, multimillion-dollar settlements sometimes follow, he said, citing recent cases against Dollar General Corp and Walmart Inc.In the year ended last Sept. 30, 13 of the 93 EEOC merit lawsuits were systemic, according to agency data.Last December, the Justice Department accused Facebook of discriminating against U.S. workers broadly, saying it gave hiring preference to temporary workers such as H-1B visa holders.Alphabet Inc’s Google last month agreed to spend $3.8 million to settle U.S. government allegations that it underpaid women and unfairly passed over women and Asians for job openings.",Reuters

That may have spared many of the biggest companies and federal government agencies, the records suggest.The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment.Earlier on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the vulnerabilities found in Microsoft’s widely used Exchange servers were “significant,” and “could have far-reaching impacts.”“We’re concerned that there are a large number of victims,” Psaki said.Microsoft and the person working with the U.S. response blamed the initial wave of attacks on a Chinese government-backed actor. A Chinese government spokesman said the country was not behind the intrusions.What started as a controlled attack late last year against a few classic espionage targets grew last month to a widespread campaign. Security officials said that implied that unless China had changed tactics, a second group may have become involved.More attacks are expected from other hackers as the code used to take control of the mail servers spreads.The hackers have only used the back doors to re-enter and move around the infected networks in a small percentage of cases, probably less than 1 in 10, the person working with the government said.“A couple hundred guys are exploiting them as fast as they can,” stealing data and installing other ways to return later, he said.The initial avenue of attack was discovered by prominent Taiwanese cyber researcher Cheng-Da Tsai, who said he reported the flaw to Microsoft in January. He said in a blog post that he was investigating whether the information leaked.He did not respond to requests for further comment.",Reuters

Dulles, Virginia-based CFC has not had any loan defaults in its electric utility loan portfolio since fiscal 2013.On Friday, S&P Global Ratings said that it lowered its long-term credit rating on CFC to ‘A-’ from ‘A’, with a negative outlook.The credit rating agency said Texas’ main grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), could exercise so-called uplift provisions. In that scenario, the unpaid bills of defaulting utilities, for example, would be absorbed by remaining participants and weaken their creditworthiness.Numerous Texas electric co-ops are facing potential bankruptcy due to the massive bills incurred when power prices spiked during the Texas freeze that killed several dozen people and left millions without power for days.CFC, which is searching for a replacement of its long-time chief executive, will be put to the test in the coming weeks and months as Texas electric utilities and cooperatives sort out billions of dollars in unpaid charges from the collapse of the state’s main electric grid.On Monday, Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc, the biggest electric co-op in Texas, filed for bankruptcy protection in Houston, citing a disputed $1.8 billion debt to the state’s main grid operator.CFC has disclosed that it has $85 million in outstanding unsecured loans and letters of credit to Brazos. CFC said it is not currently able to assess to what extent, if any, the bankruptcy process may impair the lender’s ability to collect the amounts outstanding, according to a U.S. regulatory filing.CFC did not return a message seeking comment.S&P said it believes CFC has adequate funding and about $8.7 billion in liquidity to absorb losses.CFC is a tax-exempt, member-owned finance cooperative run by CEO Sheldon Petersen, who has quadrupled the size of CFC’s loan portfolio over the past 25 years. Global executive search firm Korn Ferry is looking for someone to replace Petersen, who plans to retire this year.About 98% of CFC’s portfolio consists of loans to rural electric systems. Its financing supplements the loan programs of the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. CFC makes loans makes so electric co-ops can buy and build transmission lines and generation facilities.In 2018, for example, Texas-based Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative Inc received a $250 million line of credit from a group of lenders led by CFC, according to Refinitiv data.Like Brazos Electric, Rayburn is due to receive a massive energy bill linked to last month’s storms. Rayburn expects to receive about $735 million in invoices from Texas’ main electric grid operator for costs associated with energy spikes during the recent deep freeze.That is about 92,000% more than Rayburn’s normal February weekly bill of about $800,000, according to disclosures with Texas utilities regulators.",Reuters
551,"'No sense of job security': Amazon union organizers tell lawmakers in Alabama
A group of U.S. lawmakers visited an Amazon facility in Alabama on Friday to lend support to a growing push to unionize its workers, in what labor leaders and lawmakers called one of the most important union elections in United States history.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-amazon-labor/no-sense-of-job-security-amazon-union-organizers-tell-lawmakers-in-alabama-idUSKBN2AX19K,"(Reuters) - A group of U.S. lawmakers visited an Amazon facility in Alabama on Friday to lend support to a growing push to unionize its workers, in what labor leaders and lawmakers called one of the most important union elections in United States history.Workers at the Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, are voting on whether to become the first employees in the U.S. to join a union at one of the country’s largest employers.The visit comes on the heels of President Joe Biden’s recent statement defending workers’ rights to form unions. While he did not mention Amazon, he referenced “workers in Alabama.”The move by the Alabama workers, which is being backed by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), is a critical one for the U.S. labor movement that has struggled with declining membership in recent years. It is also a watershed moment for a growing unionizing drive within the tech industry that has long been hostile to organized labor.The congressional delegation includes U.S. Representatives Andy Levin, Jamaal Bowman, Cori Bush, Terri Sewell, and Nikema Williams.“This is the most important election for the working class of this country in the 21st century,” Rep. Levin said, addressing workers in Bessemer. “This is the biggest election in the south in a generation.”Rep. Sewell, whose district includes Bessemer, likened the fight to the civil rights struggles in the area’s past.“I know that Amazon workers stand in the same tradition as John Lewis...as those foot soldiers that dare to change the world by having the audacity to stand up for their rights.”Bowman went a step further and urged Amazon workers around the country to pay attention to their working conditions.The lawmakers also privately met with workers and organizers from the facility.“We just want what’s owed to us,” said Kevin Jackson, an Amazon worker at the Bessemer warehouse who attended the meetings. “We want a seat at the table.”Michael Foster, a lead RWDSU organizer, said workers at the facility reached out to the union for help, not the other way around. “We know we have people walking on egg shells because they have no sense of job security,” he said.Amazon spokeswoman Heather Knox said she does not believe the RWDSU represents the majority of employees’ views and that Amazon offered “some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.”Knox also said the company hopes “these members of Congress will spend this same amount of energy on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour —as Amazon did for all of our employees in 2018.”The vote could also help kickstart a new chapter for the labor movement in the southern states, where unions have long struggled to gain a foothold, labor experts said.One of the main reasons for this has been fewer job opportunities in the region and political hostility toward unions, said William Gould, a labor law expert at Stanford Law. Gould is also a former chairman of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).“But that is changing because of how companies such as Amazon have really tested the limits of workers’ endurance,” he said, adding that the pandemic had exacerbated existing health and safety issues.Bessemer, which is about 15 miles (24 km) away from Birmingham, the most populous city in the state, is majority African American - a fact that has also made the fight an important one for several lawmakers.Levin separately told Reuters Amazon’s policies are “egregious”, especially those such as “trying to force an in-person election in a pandemic hotspot.”The NLRB decided on Jan. 15 to not allow in-person voting due to safety concerns during the pandemic. Earlier this month, close to 6,000 workers began voting by mail on whether to join the union.Amazon spokeswoman Knox maintained that “Amazon proposed a safe on-site election process validated by COVID-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already-scheduled shifts.”",Reuters

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it will boost sampling of foods for babies and young children and increase inspections after a congressional report found ""dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals"" in some baby foods that it said could cause neurological damage.

It highlights the need for Congress to pass legislation with strict standards and timelines.”The FDA has declared that inorganic arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury are dangerous, particularly to infants and children. The FDA in August finalized guidance to industry, setting an action level of 100 parts per billion inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal.The FDA said on Friday it plans to finalize draft guidance on reducing inorganic arsenic in apple juice and publish draft guidance that will establish action levels for lead in juices.Baby food companies say they are working to reducing levels of metals that occur naturally in food products.",Reuters
553,"Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors weigh how far tech stocks can slide after volatile week
As U.S. technology shares stumble, investors are debating whether the decline is an opportunity to scoop up bargains or a sign of more pain to come for stocks that have led markets higher for years.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-weekahead/wall-street-week-ahead-investors-weigh-how-far-tech-stocks-can-slide-after-volatile-week-idUSKBN2AX2KK,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As U.S. technology shares stumble, investors are debating whether the decline is an opportunity to scoop up bargains or a sign of more pain to come for stocks that have led markets higher for years.The Nasdaq Composite, an index heavily populated by tech and growth names, has slumped 8.3% since its Feb 12 closing record, over three times the decline for the S&P 500. Drops in popular growth stocks have been even steeper, with Tesla shares off 27% and Peloton down 32%.Taking advantage of pullbacks in names like Apple and Amazon has been a winning strategy over the last decade as big technology and growth stocks drove the market’s gains. In a sign some bargain-hunters may have already swooped in after a bumpy week, the Nasdaq reversed a steep loss during Friday’s session to end up 1.6%.Some market participants, however, worry the current decline could be longer-lasting than previous dips, as expectations of a powerful U.S. economic recovery fuel a shift away from the “stay-at-home” trade towards names primed to benefit from a nationwide reopening. A surge in bond yields is accelerating that rotation, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hitting 1.625% on Friday, its highest level in over a year.“As the economy reopens, other sectors are going to have fantastic earnings growth,” said Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. Earnings increases for the large tech and growth stocks are “not going to look nearly as good.”Data on Friday showing U.S. employment rising more than expected in February offered further evidence of a rebounding economy.Investors are awaiting the March 16-17 Federal Reserve meeting, after comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave little indication that the central bank was concerned by the recent yield rally.The rise in Treasury yields, which move inversely to bond prices, means bonds offer greater competition to equities and other comparatively risky investments. Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.The S&P 500 technology sector has pulled back 7% since yields began their latest surge in mid-February, while the Russell 1000 growth index has fallen 7.7% against a 1.8% gain for its counterpart value index, which is replete with bank and other stocks expected to gain in a rebounding economy.Chase Investment Counsel, a wealth management firm, has scaled back its tech holdings in recent weeks, including selling some Apple and Qualcomm shares, over concerns about their valuations and evidence the market was rotating elsewhere, said Chase President Peter Tuz.“Clearly the stocks are not acting well compared to a lot of other groups out there,” Tuz said. The economic rebound is also likely to give a strong boost to earnings in beaten down sectors, taking the shine off some technology companies’ expected results.Profits for the financials, materials and industrials sectors in 2021 are estimated to jump 23%, 34% and 72%, respectively, according to Refinitiv IBES, compared to a 15% rise for tech companies.At the same time, valuations in the sector remain historically elevated. At 26.6 times forward earnings, the technology sector’s valuation has pulled back but it remains well above its historical average of nearly 21, according to Refinitiv Datastream.Still, some investors believe the pullback could be an opportunity to buy, pointing to tech companies’ solid profitability that can persist even after the earnings rebound in the broad economy peters out. While elevated historically, the sector’s valuation is also well below levels during the dot-com bubble 20 years ago, that saw the Nasdaq drop over 50% in less than a year.“The health of tech today is so far superior to what it was,” said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust. “I am still optimistic and I still think that the fundamentals are solid. I don’t see a huge pullback like in the summer of 2000.”",Reuters

The charges were brought in Manhattan federal court.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed related civil charges concerning the alleged pump-and-dump scheme.Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement: “As alleged, McAfee and Watson exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception.”Lawyers for McAfee could not immediately be identified. McAfee is being detained in Spain following his arrest there on tax evasion charges announced in October, the Justice Department said.Watson was arrested on Thursday night in Texas, the department added.Watson’s attorney Arnold Spencer said in a statement: “Jimmy Watson is a decorated veteran and former Navy Seal. He fought for other people’s rights and liberties, and he is entitled to and looks forward to his day in court to exercise some of those very rights.”Both also face civil charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which in October accused McAfee of concealing more than $23.1 million he made from boosting seven cryptocurrency offerings on Twitter.In the cryptocurrency cases, authorities said McAfee touted assets including Verge, Reddcoin and Dogecoin as part of a “Coin of the Day” or “Coin of the Week” tweet from around December 2017 through February 2018.Authorities said McAfee held himself up as an expert on cybersecurity and cryptocurrency through his tweets, speeches and his role as a CEO of a publicly traded cryptocurrency company. They also accused him of telling followers he had no stake in the coins, even as he touted how they “will change the world.”",Reuters

The divestiture process must conclude by May 7, the regulator added.Mexican broadcaster Televisa later in 2019 won an injunction against the merger over its impact on competition in Mexico, but the IFT said that the ruling would not stall the deal.",Reuters

U.S. conservatives praised Donald Trump at an annual gathering on Friday, even unveiling a golden statue of the former president, showing he remains a Republican political force despite violent scenes in Washington last month.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-conservatives/with-gold-colored-trump-statue-conservatives-show-fealty-to-former-president-idUSKBN2AQ1GZ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. conservatives praised Donald Trump at an annual gathering on Friday, even unveiling a golden statue of the former president, showing he remains a Republican political force despite violent scenes in Washington last month.Prominent congressional conservatives - including Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley and Representatives Steve Scalise and Matt Gaetz - were among the Trump loyalists speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, which the former president will address on Sunday.“Let me tell you something: Donald Trump ain’t going anywhere,” said Cruz.Trump’s tumultuous final weeks in office saw his supporters launch a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to block Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s election victory, a win that Trump falsely claimed was tainted by widespread fraud.If there was any doubt that CPAC this year was devoted to Trump, the gold-colored statue of the former president, dressed in a jacket, red tie and Stars-and-Stripes boxing shorts, was on display at the conference site.Two participants wheeled the larger-than-life statue through the conference center lobby, according to a video on social media. It was unclear why the statue, showing a cartoonish version of Trump with an oversize head, was there.The statue drew instant derision online, with commentators comparing it to the golden calf that enraged the prophet Moses in the Old Testament.“Idol worship isn’t conservative. #RestoreOurGop,” Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 attack, said on Twitter.Gaetz declared himself part of the “pro-Trump, America First” wing of the conservative movement. “We’re not really a wing, we’re the whole body,” he said.He also appeared to forecast a future role for Trump, who is pondering another run for president in 2024: “Trump may not have drained the swamp all the way – yet.”U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican who may run for the party’s presidential nomination in 2024, sought to thread the needle between pledging loyalty to Trump and signaling his aspirations for higher office.He said “President Trump has flaws” but that he had made the party more approachable for working-class Americans.“We will not win the future by going back to where the Republican Party used to be,” Scott said. “If we do, we will lose the working base that President Trump so animated. We’re going to lose elections across the country and ultimately we’re going to lose our nation.”‘NOT THE PAST’Hawley, another possible 2024 candidate, called himself part of the future of the party.“We’re not the past, we’re the future. We represent the future of this country,” he said.Trump is expected to talk on Sunday about the future of the party and lay out policy differences within a group riven by differences in the wake of his chaotic four years in office.“The divide right now is between the ‘Beltway elites’ and the conservative grassroots around the country,” said a Trump adviser who helped prepare the speech.Trump will also offer red-meat rhetoric critical of his successor, Democrat President Joe Biden.Trump supporters at the conference on Friday repeated some of his false claims, arguing that they justified new restrictions on voting.In addition to the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, seven Senate Republicans voted to convict him of inciting insurrection, although the 57-43 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict.Many other senior Republicans did not attend this year’s event. They included former Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Representative Liz Cheney - another House Republican who voted to impeach.Some advisers say they want Trump not to use his speech to relitigate the election at length but instead offer a road map to Republicans’ regaining control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2022 congressional elections.CPAC is an event organized by the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, is close to Trump. It is a prime venue for speakers who want to gauge interest in whether they should run for president based on the enthusiasm they generate.",Reuters

She worked for the governor as an executive assistant and policy advisor for nearly two years until November 2020, according to her LinkedIn profile.“I was trying to be a mentor to her. I never made advances toward Ms. Bennett nor did I ever intend to act in any way that was inappropriate,” Cuomo said in a statement on Saturday.He called for “a full and thorough outside review” led by a former federal judge and said he would have no further comment until it was completed.Bennett did not immediately return a request for comment sent via Twitter.Cuomo rose to national prominence for his leadership at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when New York was the country’s COVID-19 epicenter.The latest accusations came just days after another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, wrote in an online essay that the governor made several “inappropriate gestures” toward her while she worked for the state government from 2015 to 2018.They ranged from sending her a rose on Valentine’s Day to kissing her on the mouth, she said.Boylan is now a candidate for Manhattan borough president.Cuomo denied those accusations in December and issued another denial this week. Multiple attempts to reach Boylan have been unsuccessful.Bennett, who is 25, told the Times that Cuomo said to her in one encounter in June that he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.Bennett said she discussed the interaction with Cuomo’s chief of staff Jill DesRosiers and was subsequently transferred to a job as a health policy advisor to the governor. She also provided a statement to a special counsel to the governor, Judith Mogul, in June, she told the Times.Beth Garvey, special counsel and senior advisor to Cuomo, said in a statement that Bennett had been “consulted regarding the resolution, and expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the way in which it was handled.”“The determination reached based on the information Ms Bennett provided was that no further action was required which was consistent with Ms Bennett’s wishes,” Garvey said.Allegations about his conduct with female aides follow another major controversy that has dogged Cuomo in recent weeks.A report from the state attorney general’s office last month cast doubt on the Cuomo administration’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis in nursing homes, saying that the state health department significantly undercounted the toll and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.A top aide to Cuomo later told lawmakers the administration had delayed providing requested data about COVID-19 death toll among nursing home residents for fear of a politically motivated investigation by the Justice Department under the then-president, Republican Donald Trump.",Reuters
558,Biden scores legislative win as House passes $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/biden-scores-legislative-win-as-house-passes-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-plan-idUSKBN2AQ1FT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden scored his first legislative win as the House of Representatives passed his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package early Saturday, though Democrats face challenges to their hopes of using the bill to raise the minimum wage.Democrats who control the chamber passed the sweeping measure by a mostly party-line vote of 219 to 212 and sent it on to the Senate, where Democrats planned a legislative maneuver to allow them to pass it without the support of Republicans.The American Rescue Plan would pay for vaccines and medical supplies and send a new round of emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments. The bill’s big-ticket items include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, a $400-per-week federal unemployment benefit through Aug. 29, and help for those in difficulty paying rents and home mortgages during the pandemic.In brief remarks on Saturday from the White House’s Roosevelt Room, Biden said he called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to thank her for her support and urged the Senate to take up the bill quickly.“I hope it will receive quick action. We have no time to waste,” Biden said, without taking questions. “The people of this country have suffered far too much for far too long.”Democrats said the package was needed to fight a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.“The American people need to know that their government is there for them,” Pelosi said in a debate on the House floor.Republicans, who have broadly backed previous COVID-19 spending, said much of the current package was not necessary, highlighting elements such as a subway near Pelosi’s San Francisco district. Only 9% of the total would go directly toward fighting the virus, they said.“It just throws out money without accountability,” House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said.Democrats pointed to a recent Quinnipiac University poll showing 68% of Americans supported the package, including 47% of Republicans, with just 37% of Republicans opposing it.“This critical legislation has support from Americans across the country and the political spectrum, and yet Republicans in Congress are trying to stand in the way,” said Jamie Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.The House vote amounted to a successful first test for Democrats, who hold a narrow 221-211 majority in the chamber. Progressives and moderates in the party who are often at odds will face tougher battles ahead on immigration and climate change initiatives that Biden wants to push.The president has focused his first weeks in office on tackling the greatest U.S. public health crisis in a century, which has upended most aspects of American life.Democrats aim to get the bill to him to sign into law before mid-March, when enhanced unemployment benefits and some other types of aid are due to expire.The action now moves to the Senate, where Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris may have to cast a tie-breaking vote in a chamber where Republicans control 50 seats and Democrats and their allies control the other 50.Democrats will have to sort out how to handle a proposed minimum-wage increase, which may have to be stripped from the bill due to the complicated rules that govern the Senate.The House-passed bill would raise the national hourly minimum wage for the first time since 2009, to $15 from $7.25. The increase is a top priority for progressive Democrats.However, the Senate’s rules expert said on Thursday that the wage hike did not qualify for special treatment that allows the rest of the bill to be passed with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the 100-seat chamber.Pelosi predicted the relief bill will pass Congress with or without the increase, and said Democrats would not give up on the matter.It is not clear whether the minimum-wage hike would have survived the Senate even if it were to be kept in the bill. At least two Senate Democrats oppose it, along with most Republicans.Some senators are floating a smaller increase, to the range of $10 to $12 per hour, while Democrats are considering a penalty for large corporations that do not voluntarily pay a $15 wage, according to a Democratic aide.Efforts to craft a bipartisan coronavirus aid bill fizzled early on, shortly after Biden was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, following a series of bipartisan bills enacted in 2020.",Reuters

AT&T’s share price rose 1.7% the next day.The allegations would represent a violation of regulation that prohibits firms from disclosing significant information to securities analysts without sharing it with the public, the SEC said.

UBS raised its Brent forecast to $75 a barrel and WTI to $72 in the second half of 2021.In addition, the market got a boost after a report showed the U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in February.The nonfarm payroll report “shows that Americans are closer to pre-pandemic behavior that will drive strong demand for crude,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.Traders also noted the rising dollar, which hit its highest since November, was limiting the gain in crude prices. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.However, analysts and traders have said that slow physical crude sales and recovery for demand not predicted until around the third quarter suggest that the price rally is unwarranted.“The market suggests a tightness that does not exist. Therefore, we continue to believe that the price risk is mainly downward and that the current price is overshooting,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, said that the OPEC+ decision to extend cuts as prices move higher could threaten the consumption led-recovery in some countries.The recovery in oil prices to pre-pandemic levels has also spurred U.S. oil drillers to return to the well pad.

567,"U.S. labor market roars back; full recovery still years away
The U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in February as falling new COVID-19 infections and additional pandemic relief money from the government boosted hiring at restaurants and other services businesses, firmly putting the labor market recovery back on track.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-labor-market-roars-back-full-recovery-still-years-away-idUSKBN2AX0CY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in February as falling new COVID-19 infections and additional pandemic relief money from the government boosted hiring at restaurants and other services businesses, firmly putting the labor market recovery back on track.Though job growth momentum is expected to build in the months ahead amid an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and more fiscal stimulus, it will probably take several years for the labor market to heal from the deep scars inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, which is now in its second year.The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report on Friday showed at least 4.1 million Americans have been out of work for more than six months, accounting for 41.5% of the unemployed population in February. Another 3.5 million have permanently lost their jobs.Graphic: Unemployment duration -“There remains easy fuel for strong payroll gains in coming months as the reopening gains momentum,” said Robert Rosener, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. “But there is much further to go before conditions are consistent with maximum employment.”Nonfarm payrolls surged by 379,000 jobs last month after rising 166,000 in January. Payrolls fell in December for the first time in eight months. The economy has recouped 12.7 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in the pandemic recession.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast February payrolls increasing by 182,000 jobs. Restaurants and bars hired 286,000 workers, accounting for 75% of the payrolls gain. There were also increases in employment at hotels and motels and at amusements, gambling and recreation establishments.Altogether, leisure and hospitality employment jumped by 355,000 jobs, making up 94% of all jobs created last month.Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, increased further. Healthcare and social assistance also added jobs, and retailers hired 41,000 workers. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 21,000 jobs. About half of the factory job gains were in transportation equipment, despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has forced some automakers to cut production.But construction employment decreased by 61,000 jobs because of bitter cold across the country. Government payrolls dropped by 86,000 jobs, with losses concentrated at state and local governments. The diffusion index, or measure of private industries expanding, jumped to 57.0 from 48.4 in January.Unseasonably cold weather shortened the average workweek to 34.6 hours from 34.9 hours.The surge in hiring follows on the heels of a strong rebound in consumer spending in January, which prompted economists to sharply upgrade their growth estimates for the first quarter.A decrease in daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, and nearly $900 billion in stimulus provided by the government at the end of December are driving the revival in activity.That has raised concerns that President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion recovery plan under consideration by Congress, combined with the Federal Reserve’s near zero interest rates and bond purchases, could cause the economy to overheat.U.S. Treasury yields have spiked as investors anticipate higher inflation. Biden is not backing down.“Without a rescue plan, these gains are going to slow,” Biden said at a White House economic briefing. “We can’t afford one step forward, two steps backward. People need the help now.”Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday again brushed aside the inflation concerns, saying he expected the U.S. central bank “will be patient” until the economy is “very far along the road to recovery.”Stocks on Wall Street rallied, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.Graphic: Nonfarm payrolls -Even as the labor market recovery is regaining steam, ample slack remains. Though the unemployment rate fell to 6.2% last month from 6.3% in January, it continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.” Without this problem, the unemployment rate would have been 6.7%. It is about 9.5%, including people who have given up the search for work.While the share of long-term unemployed is below its peak near 45% during the Great Recession, it is far higher than in previous downturns where it rose not much above 20%.“This indicates that unemployment is highly concentrated among people who lost their jobs near the start of the recession, rather than workers going through relatively short spells of unemployment,” said Dean Baker, economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.Unemployment remains high among Blacks and Hispanics, as well as Americans without a high school diploma and college degrees.The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was steady at 61.4% in February. The participation rate has tumbled from 63.3% in February 2020, with women accounting for the biggest share of dropouts.According to Census Bureau data, around 10 million mothers living with their own school-age children were not actively working in January, 1.4 million more than during the same month in 2020.“There is still more slack in the labor market than the unemployment rate advertises,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. “It is difficult, if not impossible, to generate sustained inflation and higher inflation expectations when the economy is still so far away from full employment.”",Reuters

At the time of the incident, checks were required every 6,500 cycles mandated after a separate United engine failure in 2018. A cycle refers to one take-off and landing.Reuters first reported the inspection data on Feb. 24, citing sources.After the United engine failure shortly after takeoff from Denver, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of Raytheon, issued a bulletin calling for inspections every 1,000 cycles.The Federal Aviation Administration subsequently issued an emergency order requiring inspections of all 777 airplanes with PW4000 engines before resuming flights.The NTSB said earlier that damage to a fan blade in the United engine failure was consistent with metal fatigue.The agency said the blade that fractured underwent inspections in 2014 and 2016. The 2016 inspection data was examined again in 2018 after the incident involving a United 777 that suffered an engine failure near Honolulu.The engines are used on 128 older versions of the plane, accounting for less than 10% of the more than 1,600 777s delivered. Only a handful of airlines in the United States, South Korea and Japan were operating 777s with that engine before the incident.United, which is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine, declined to comment on Friday. It voluntarily grounded its fleet of 24 planes with that engine after the incident. Boeing did not immediately comment Friday.The engine failure showered engine parts over a nearby Denver suburb but no one was injured. The captain elected not to dump fuel for safety and time reasons, the NTSB said.",Reuters
569,"Analysis: Urban states come out ahead, rural states get less in Biden's COVID-19 relief bill
(This Feb. 24 story refiles to reflect Democratic-leaning states in paragraph 2)",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-states-analysi/analysis-urban-states-come-out-ahead-rural-states-get-less-in-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-idUSKBN2AO183,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package now making its way through the U.S. Congress would provide $350 billion to help pandemic-hit state and local governments balance their budgets, more than twice the amount lawmakers approved last year.But not every state comes out ahead: urban, Democratic-led states like Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts that took drastic steps to stop the coronavirus’ spread would get about three times as much money per person as they did in the package passed at the beginning of the health crisis in March.Rural, Republican-led states including Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota that did less would see less cash.That’s because Congress is giving greater weight to poverty and unemployment this time as it considers how to distribute money to keep police, firefighters and other public employees on the job during a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.It also reflects the fact that Democrats who control both chambers of Congress drafted the package for their fellow Democrat President Joe Biden without Republican input.Under the new bill, named the American Rescue Plan, 61% of the aid would end up in states that voted for Biden in November, up from 56% in the bipartisan CARES Act passed last March.Reuters examined House Oversight Committee projections on how much direct fiscal aid each state would receive in the bill, which is set for a vote in the House of Representatives this week before moving to the Senate.It is expected to pass, even if no Republicans vote for it.The CARES Act distributed $140 billion to state and local governments based on population, delivering a minimum of $1.25 billion to each state. That gave the largest per-capita benefits to the states with the smallest populations, including Wyoming and Vermont. Another $3 billion was set aside for Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories.This time around, Democrats have lowered the per-state minimum to $500 million. The remaining $300 billion would be allocated based on unemployment and poverty levels as well as population. Tribal governments and territories would get $24.5 billion. Washington, D.C., would be treated like a state.Advocates say the new formula ensures the money goes where it is needed, as COVID-19’s toll has been uneven across the country. Unemployment in December topped 9% in tourism-dependent Nevada and Hawaii, triple the 3% in Nebraska and South Dakota.“This is a more targeted approach,” said Michael Leachman, a budget expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who supports additional state and local aid.Republicans say the bill short-changes states that have imposed fewer coronavirus-related restrictions.“The real reason for this bill is to send billions to bail out blue-state governors and reward their harmful lockdown policies,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri said at a House Budget Committee hearing on Monday.The new bill would direct roughly $800 per person to Republican-led Utah and Alabama, which had some of the least restrictive COVID-19 responses, according to Oxford University researchers.It would send roughly $1,200 per person to Democratic-led Massachusetts and New York, among the most restrictive.Democrats argue that the money should be targeted towards areas that have suffered the most.“Since when is unemployment not a legitimate indicator of economic distress?” Representative David Price, a Democrat from North Carolina, said at the same hearing.State and local aid has proven to be one of the most divisive aspects of the multi-trillion dollar effort Washington has mounted in the past year to fight the virus and keep the world’s largest economy afloat.Republicans and Democrats both broadly supported small-business loans and direct payments to families.But Republicans have balked at providing more aid to state and local governments. State and local aid was excluded from a bipartisan $900 billion bill that passed in December.The National Association of State Budget Officers calculated state revenues would drop 10.8% in the current fiscal year when compared with pre-pandemic estimates, affecting Republican-led and Democratic-led states alike.Some analysts say the Democrats’ proposal, which adds up to about $500 billion when spending for public schools, transit and other aid is included, provides states with more than they need, however.“People dramatically overestimated how bad the state and local finances would be,” Stan Veuger, an economist at the center-right American Enterprise Institute.Bipartisan groups like the National Governors Association have argued that further aid is needed to help states deliver health care and education and avoid further layoffs that could prolong the recovery, though they have not endorsed specific proposals.Though the new bill would steer more money towards large states, smaller states still fare well. Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota, each with fewer than 1 million residents, are still among the top 10 recipients on a per capita basis.",Reuters

They included the increase in his coronavirus relief bill to help tackle the heavy human and economic toll of the pandemic, which has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Democrats are trying to advance the COVID-19 bill under a special “budget reconciliation” process that would allow them to pass it in the Senate using a simple majority, so they will not need Republican support.But there are rules that limit what can be included using that process, and it is the job of Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough to determine what is allowed.“This decision reinforces reconciliation cannot be used as a vehicle to pass major legislative change - by either party - on a simple majority vote,” Graham wrote on Twitter.The negative ruling does not mean the idea of raising the minimum wage is dead.

She dismissed breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims.Neither Geico nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment on Friday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to similar requests.Geico had last April offered policyholders $2.5 billion of credits, including 15% on renewals from April to October, averaging about $150 per policy.But policyholders led by Briana Siegal said this induced them to renew and pay excessive premiums rather than shop around, as stay-at-home orders and closures of businesses and schools resulted in less time on the road.Siegal also said Geico’s credits compared unfavorably with refunds offered by other insurers.She cited a report by the Consumer Federation of America and Center for Economic Justice awarding Geico’s program a “D-minus,” below the “A” and “B” grades given to State Farm and Allstate Corp, which offered refunds.Without ruling on the merits, Coleman said the plaintiffs adequately alleged that Geico misled them into thinking it was passing on all its savings from reduced driving, and failed to disclose that its premiums were “not based on an accurate assessment of risk during COVID-19.”Geico’s “loss ratio,” or percentage of premiums paid to cover claims, fell to 74.1% in 2020 from 81.3% a year earlier, and was the lowest since 2007.Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has owned all of Geico since 1996.

During several days of brutal cold in Texas, the city of Austin saw its fleet of 12 new electric buses rendered inoperative by a statewide power outage. That problem will be magnified next year, when officials plan to start purchasing electric-powered vehicles exclusively.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-weather-grids-autos-insight/ev-rollout-will-require-huge-investments-in-strained-u-s-power-grids-idUSKBN2AX18Y,"(Reuters) - During several days of brutal cold in Texas, the city of Austin saw its fleet of 12 new electric buses rendered inoperative by a statewide power outage. That problem will be magnified next year, when officials plan to start purchasing electric-powered vehicles exclusively.The city’s transit agency has budgeted $650 million over 20 years for electric buses and a charging facility for 187 such vehicles. But officials are still trying to solve the dilemma of power interruptions like the Texas freeze.“Redundancy and resiliency when it comes to power is something we have long understood will be an issue,” said Capitol Metro spokeswoman Jenna Maxfield.Austin’s predicament highlights the challenges facing governments, utilities and auto manufacturers as they respond to climate change. More electric cars will require both charging infrastructure and much greater electric-grid capacity. Utilities and power generators will have to invest billions of dollars creating that additional capacity while also facing the challenge of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources.Extreme weather events add additional layers of difficulty.“Reliability keeps you awake,” California Energy Commission member Siva Gunda said in an interview.Rolling blackouts during a California heat wave last year prompted the state to direct its utilities to procure emergency generating capacity for this summer and to reform its planning for reserve power.The state plans an aggressive phase-out of sales of gas- and diesel-powered cars and trucks by 2035 - which, if achieved, would require vast increases in electric grid capacity. (For a graphic on the extra power that will be needed for electric cars, click tmsnrt.rs/3rhyX4S )Graphic: Estimated U.S. capacity if 66% of all cars are EVs by 2050 -The power and transport sectors combined make up more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Their simultaneous greening is considered critical for the United States - the world's second-largest emitter behind China - to meet its obligations under an international accord to address global warming. (For a graphic on the energy sources that fuel U.S. transportation now, click tmsnrt.rs/387haFR )Graphic: Fossil fuels power the U.S. transportation sector -The goal is to power electric cars with renewable energy rather than the coal and natural gas that currently dominate the U.S. power supply. To realize that vision, electricity from intermittent sources like wind and solar will need to be stored, probably through battery technology, so that cars can charge overnight or at other times when supply outstrips demand.A model utility with two to three million customers would need to invest between $1,700 and $5,800 in grid upgrades per EV through 2030, according to Boston Consulting Group. Assuming 40 million EVs on the road, that investment could reach $200 billion.So far, investor-owned companies have plans approved for just $2.6 billion in charging programs and projects, according to trade group Edison Electric Institute.“The electrification of the transportation sector will catch most utilities a little bit off guard,” said Ben Kroposki, director of the Power Systems Engineering Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).The organization estimates that, by 2050, the electrification of transportation and other sectors will require a doubling of U.S. generation capacity.If not managed carefully, the needed investments could saddle consumers with higher energy bills, according to a report last month by California’s utility regulator. Another challenge: lower-income customers often can’t afford to make the upfront investment in electric cars, home batteries and rooftop solar systems that could save them money in the long term.‘CHICKEN AND EGG’ PROBLEMSUtilities are embracing EV sales growth as both a promising new source of revenue and an opportunity to use excess wind and solar power generated at very windy or sunny times when supply exceeds demand.Investments in both the grid and charging infrastructure that are recovered from ratepayers could add between $3 billion and $10 billion in cumulative cash flow to the average utility through 2030, according to Boston Consulting Group. The forecast also includes potential revenues from new products outside of utilities’ regulated businesses, such as customer fleet routing or charging station maintenance.The revenue opportunity is still nascent, however, with EVs making up less than 2% of all vehicles registered in the United States. And utilities must invest in infrastructure now for consumers to feel secure in their purchase of an EV, said Emily Fisher, general counsel of utility trade group Edison Electric Institute.“There is definitely a chicken-and-egg situation with charging infrastructure,” she said.AUTOMAKERS BET BIG ON EVsMajor U.S. automakers General Motors and Ford have announced large investments in EV development to keep pace with electric-car pioneer Tesla Inc and to prepare for the prospect of tougher emissions regulations. EV share could grow to 15% by 2030, according to U.S. Department of Energy forecasts.The electricity to power all those cars is expected to come primarily from renewable energy sources and natural gas, according to NREL. Even if natural gas generation increases to support electrified transportation, overall emissions are projected to decline, the organization said.Large new investments may pose difficulties for utilities already experiencing weather-related problems. In Texas, many of the companies that would be making those investments face a financial crisis stemming from last month’s cold snap. Utilities and power marketers face billions of dollars in blackout-related charges, and several have filed for bankruptcy.Daimler Trucks, the world’s biggest maker of heavy-duty haulers, plans to sell electric vehicles in Europe, North America and Japan by next year. But the company is grappling with how to charge what will one day become hundreds of thousands of battery-powered trucks, said Daimler Trucks chairman Martin Daum.The need for massive investments in grid infrastructure and charging stations “cannot be underestimated,” Daum said.Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley last week called on U.S. government leaders to support EV sales with favorable regulation and subsidies for the production of batteries and charging infrastructure.But Robert Barrosa, senior director at Volkswagen AG’s Electrify America, which is building out fast-charging stations throughout the nation, said the gradual pace of EV adoption will allow utilities to adapt.“We’re not in a doom-and-gloom situation,” Barrosa said. “We’re not going to 80% battery electric sales overnight...it will be a natural transition.”Barrosa said U.S. energy consumption decreases over the last 20 years, due to efficiency gains in appliances and the transportation sector, mean that the U.S. power system has enough established capacity to support EV growth without the immediate need for big investments. (For a graphic on U.S. power generation and consumption, click tmsnrt.rs/3e5f6SH)Graphic: The U.S. is generating more electricity than it consumes -Utility Xcel Energy said EV adoption would likely not require capacity additions until after 2030, and that near-term investments would mainly be in distribution systems. The company is planning to accommodate 1.5 million electric vehicles in its Midwest and Western service territories by 2030, about 30 times more than its current capability.The utility in December received approval to spend $110 million on electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Colorado, which passed a law in 2019 requiring utilities to develop plans for widespread transportation electrification. The plan is expected to add 65 cents a month to residential customer bills.Electric vehicles - especially commercial ones with large batteries - can help stabilize the grid in the long run by feeding power back into the system during times of peak demand, using chargers that allow electricity to flow in both directions. Passenger cars that sit idle most of the day could one day earn money by feeding power back into the grid with the help of bi-directional chargers, utilities predict.During the Texas outages, some Twitter users said they used their electric vehicles to power their homes. But wider applications of such vehicle-to-grid technology would require larger infrastructure changes and utility involvement.“Planning is going to be more sophisticated,” said Ryan Popple, co-founder of Proterra, which produced some of Austin’s electric buses. “And as vehicle-to-grid becomes more common with our commercial fleets, it’s actually going to make the overall technology even more attractive.”",Reuters

They were down 0.1% on Friday at $13.55.Driving the gains are investor expectations that the worst may be over for the conglomerate. GE saw its stock pummeled in recent years due to a host of setbacks, among them misplaced bets on fossil fuels-related businesses and the widespread economic damage wrought by the pandemic.An investor conference scheduled for March 10 appears to have heightened interest in the stock in recent days. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the company this week by $4 to $17 per share. UBS also raised its target.“The company has been through a lot but it’s getting its sea legs,” said William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann.GE’s turnaround, which was interrupted by the coronavirus-induced recession that hit the company’s aviation business particularly hard, appeared to be “back on track and likely to be quicker than expected prior to the pandemic,” Heymann said.Since taking the reins in 2018, Chief Executive Larry Culp has been focusing on lean-manufacturing practices aimed at eliminating waste and continuous improvement. Heymann cited a boost from rising interest rates due to GE’s pension plan deficit as well as plans for greener products as key drivers of the company’s recovery.Jason Adams, portfolio manager for the T. Rowe Price global industrials fund, cautioned that the company’s turnaround will likely take time. Even GE CEO Culp has referred to the company’s revamp as a “game of inches.”“This is not a 2021 story,” Adams said. “This is really about the transformation that GE is undergoing under Larry Culp’s leadership and where earnings and free cash flow can get to in the 2022-2025 time horizon.”T. Rowe Price owned some 7.8% of GE’s shares outstanding at the end of 2020 and was the biggest single owner of the stock according to the latest publicly available information.Morgan Stanley said it expects a multi-year path to above consensus free-cash flow of around $0.90 per share in 2023.UBS on Wednesday raised its price target to $15 from $14, suggesting that rising rates and the COVID-relief bill could be material positives for GE’s pension liability.",Reuters

It remains at loggerheads with Boeing over the status of a separate order for 97 U.S. passenger jets.The airline’s name was dropped from a monthly update of orders issued by Airbus on Friday, leaving the European firm with a negative total of 81 orders for January and February.Reuters first reported hefty upcoming order cancellations on Feb. 23, on the eve of a court hearing at which agreement over the terms of the cancellation was announced.The cancellation marks a turning point in the jet industry, nine years after Airbus and Boeing waged an epic contest for the young airline’s business.After losing the main order battle to Boeing, Airbus struck a last-ditch deal to sell 100 of its own planes to help the airline set up its own leasing operation at a time of booming travel demand, people familiar with the negotiations said.The deal was widely seen as a high point in a bruising market-share war between plane giants that weighed on prices and stoked trade tensions as budget carriers took advantage of cheap interest rates to scoop up the latest fuel-saving airplanes.But the gamble did not pay off and Norwegian’s plans to diversify into financing, as well as losses at its core airline, left a hole in the production plans of both planemakers.After growing rapidly to become Europe’s third-largest low-cost airline and the biggest foreign carrier serving New York and other major U.S. cities, Norwegian sought bankruptcy protection last November with debts over $7 billion.Airbus said on Friday it had sold 10 A320neos to an unidentified customer. That reassigns part of the yet-to-be-produced fleet ordered by Norwegian, industry sources said.Financiers say both jetmakers are expected to keep Norwegian’s deposits.Airbus meanwhile said it had delivered 32 jets in February, bringing the total for the year to 53. Boeing delivered 26 jets in January, the latest period for which data is available.",Reuters

They said they had agreed with Brussels that it was necessary to ensure economic discontinuity between the old airline and a proposed new carrier.Italy has earmarked 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) to launch a new state-owned airline, dubbed ITA, to replace Alitalia, which has been run by state-appointed administrators since it was declared bankrupt in 2017.Rome and Brussels will start discussions next week over “possible solutions to ensure that the new air carrier is created as soon as possible in accordance with the procedures of national and European law,” Italy’s economy, transport and industry ministers said in a joint statement on Friday.A state-supported flag carrier needs the green light from the European Commission, which has asked for an open tender of Alitalia assets and is pressing for the new airline to forsake the old brand and some of its airport slots.Alitalia’s administrator complained last month that it would take four to five months to organise an open tender, during which the company would accrue more losses, with the launch of its replacement pushed back to mid-summer.To unblock the project, Rome could kick-start a process for the direct sale of Alitalia’s aviation business to ITA in the short term, one industry source told Reuters, adding maintenance and handling divisions would be put on sale with an open tender in a second step.Separately, USAerospace Partners Chairwoman Michele Roosevelt Edwards said she had asked for a meeting with the Italian government over Alitalia and added the American aviation service group was ready to invest $1.5 billion in the carrier.USAerospace said a partnership with ITA and the Italian government could have more chances of success than the launch of a “small company with no critical mass”.($1 = 0.8379 euros)",Reuters

582,"In Pennsylvania, Republican rift over Trump imperils party’s election chances
C. Arnold McClure chairs the Republican Party in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - deep in Trump country - and wants to punish fellow conservatives who have turned against the former president.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-pennsylvania-insight/in-pennsylvania-republican-rift-over-trump-imperils-partys-election-chances-idUSKBN2AP2J7,"EXTON, Pa. (Reuters) - C. Arnold McClure chairs the Republican Party in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - deep in Trump country - and wants to punish fellow conservatives who have turned against the former president.McClure is among those pushing the state party to censure Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, for voting this month to convict Donald Trump, at his second impeachment trial, of inciting the U.S. Capitol riots. McClure will apply the same standard to any Republican candidate in upcoming elections who seeks support in his rural county: Those who have defended Trump will pass “our first litmus test,” he said. He has a simple question for any who have not: “What the hell?”Other Pennsylvania party leaders say that’s a great way to keep losing elections - after Republicans ceded the White House and control of both houses of Congress to Democrats under Trump’s watch. Shunning Trump’s Republican critics “sends a wrong signal to many of those that are independents or leaning Republican,” said Sam DeMarco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh.Those dueling views encapsulate the rift among Republicans in Pennsylvania and nationally that some party leaders, along with opinion polls, suggest could imperil its chances in the 2022 congressional elections. Interviews with two dozen Republican officials, activists and political analysts reveal a deep split over strategy in Pennsylvania - a key battleground that could determine whether Republicans retake the Senate next year.Republicans face a potentially self-destructive dynamic in statewide races: Trump loyalists may well prevail over moderate candidates in party primaries, but they are more likely to lose general campaigns against Democrats by turning off centrist voters.“If that primary is going to be a race to the extreme right - and a race to see who is most loyal to Donald Trump - I guarantee you it will be extremely difficult for the Republican Party to win,” said Gene DiGirolamo, a Republican county commissioner in Bucks County - a Philadelphia suburb - and a former state representative.A growing number of Republican voters are unhappy with the party’s direction, according to a Feb. 18-24 Reuters/Ipsos poll. Nearly half – 48% – of self-identified Republicans believe their party “has lost its way,” up 17 percentage points from a similar poll in December. A Reuters review of Pennsylvania state data shows more than 22,000 voters had left the party this year through Feb. 22, compared with fewer than 8,000 Democrats.Still, many party leaders argue that turning against Trumpism isn’t the way forward. Sean Gale, an attorney and fierce Trump backer who has announced a run for Toomey’s seat, said the party has tried and failed to win elections with centrist candidates.“Running a moderate, or a ‘Democrat-light’ Republican, to attract independents and Democrats is a proven recipe for disaster,” he said in an email. “The GOP tried this in 2008 with John McCain and 2012 with Mitt Romney.”Trump lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes in November, four years after his upset victory there in 2016. The former president nonetheless remains the de facto leader of the Republican Party. Trump will deliver his first speech since leaving office at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday in Orlando, Fla.Trump spokesman Jason Miller did not respond to a request for comment. A Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump plans to use his political action committee as a “weapon” against more moderate Republicans in next year’s elections.“He’s still going to have an enormous amount of influence on both the direction of the policy and also in evaluating who is a serious standard-bearer for that message,” the adviser said.The Republican Party’s state committee in Pennsylvania met on Wednesday to consider censuring Toomey, but the vote was derailed after a glitch with its electronic balloting system. The party had not yet rescheduled the vote early Thursday.Trump’s brash brand of politics will be on display this Saturday in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, when Lauren Boebert - the gun-toting freshman congresswoman from Colorado - will address gun rights at a party fundraiser.Boebert, a fierce Trump backer, has amplified his false election-fraud claims. She’s also boosted ticket sales for the Pennsylvania fundraiser, said Robert Arena, the county party’s executive director.“The congresswoman is a rising name,” he said.Arena and some other Republican leaders downplayed the party rift, arguing it will be more united for the 2022 campaigns after more than a year under Democratic control in Washington.A pivotal question: Who will they unite behind? Polls suggest Trump’s popularity has faded. About 7 in 10 Republicans approved of Trump in a Jan. 8-12 Reuters/Ipsos poll taken during his last month in office, down from as high as 9 in 10 last year.Still, no other Republican comes close to being perceived as the party’s standard-bearer. Reuters/Ipsos polling between Feb. 18 and 24 asked Republican voters to pick from a list of prominent Republicans, not including Trump, who they thought embodied the qualities of an American leader. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a chief Trump backer, polled highest, at 22%. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - who has recently blasted Trump over his role in the Capitol riots - was favored by just 3%, the same as firebrand congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been widely criticized for promoting conspiracy theories.REPUBLICAN CIVIL WAR ‘CANCELED’Asked about the attempt to censure Toomey, the party’s national Senate campaign organization pointed to comments this week from Senator Rick Scott, its chairman, declaring that the “Republican civil war has been cancelled.”“Those fanning these flames, in both the media and our own ranks, desire a GOP civil war,” he wrote in a memo. “No, we don’t have time for that.”The infighting won’t be so easy to wish away, said John Kennedy, a political science professor at West Chester University in Chester County. The increasingly Trumpian base of Republican voters, he said, will make it difficult for any moderate to win Pennsylvania’s party primaries, in which only Republicans vote.Some analysts and moderate Republicans noted that the party tried nominating Trump-like candidates for Senate and governor in 2018, and they lost by double digits. Others compared the current insurgency to the Tea Party movement that divided Republicans a decade ago, when Tea Party-backed candidates were blamed for party losses in Senate elections.Howard Merrick, the chairman of the Republican committee in Schuylkill County, a Trump stronghold, said that voters leaving the party are not necessarily just anti-Trump moderates. They also include Trump supporters who are furious with his Republican critics - and who still believe Trump’s claims that he lost a rigged election.“There are people who are very, very mad at everything that happened,” he said. “Most are mad at Congress - those senators like Toomey who have not stood up for Trump.”Yet Merrick believes the effort to censure Toomey would only further undermine the party. “It hurts us to do this,” he said.Toomey’s Senate seat in Pennsylvania is up for grabs because he has announced he will not run for re-election in 2022.The Senate is currently divided 50-50, with Democrats in power because Vice President Kamala Harris has the tie-breaking vote. Losing in Pennsylvania - widely seen as the most competitive 2022 Senate race - would make it much harder for Republicans to retake the chamber.The changing perception of Toomey, who declined an interview request, illustrates the party’s shift toward Trumpism. Once considered a reliable conservative, he’s now reviled as a traitor among some Trump backers. Toomey launched his first Senate run in 2004 against incumbent Republican Arlen Specter, who was ridiculed back then as a “RINO” – a Republican in Name Only, an insult now hurled at Toomey.Many Republicans’ demands for absolute loyalty to Trump worry Ryan Costello, a moderate former Republican congressman and Trump critic who is close to launching a bid for Toomey’s seat.“They’re demanding absolutism,” Costello said of Trump’s political operation. “If that’s what it takes to get his support, that’s a recipe for general election losses.”",Reuters

Several Republicans from states that produce fossil fuels, including Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven, both of North Dakota, and Steve Daines, of Montana, joined Democrats in supporting her.Granholm wants to boost jobs in manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and wind and solar power, and is likely to play a big role in Biden’s goal to put the country on a path of decarbonizing the economy by 2050.She said during Senate hearings that critical minerals, used in batteries for EVs and to support the electric grid, in wind turbines and solar panels, can be mined responsibly in the United States.Some Republicans who voted against her, including Senator John Barrasso of top coal producing state Wyoming, said Biden’s green push would harm high paying jobs in fossil fuels.Biden “has declared war on American energy and American energy workers and I just can’t stand by as this administration tries to crush Wyoming’s economy,” Barrasso said shortly before the vote.Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal- and natural gas-producing West Virginia, said Granholm, when governor, helped save the auto industry during the Great Recession.“She brought in new investment in new industry and she created new jobs, leaving no worker behind,” said Manchin, the chairman of the Senate energy committee.The energy secretary oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and the emergency petroleum reserve, and is a member of the president’s cabinet.Once sworn in, Granholm, 62, will be the second female U.S. energy secretary after Hazel O’Leary served in the Clinton administration in the 1990s.",Reuters

Baker added that with the deal, HBC is worth more than it ever has been before. Investors took the Canadian company private for close to C$2 billion ($1.6 billion) last year.Luxury fashion platform Mytheresa, which HBC rival Neiman Marcus Group Inc acquired in 2014, went public earlier this year, valued at $2.2 billion.Baker said a possible future IPO for the Saks e-commerce business “makes a lot of sense”.HBC said the retailer’s 40-store fleet would operate separately and would be referred to as SFA. Baker said there are no plans right now to reduce the store count as other retailers shrink their footprint.Marc Metrick, who was CEO of Saks Fifth Avenue, will take the helm at Saks, with former Amazon.com Inc executive Sebastian Gunningham also joining the e-commerce company’s board.Insight Partners has invested in a range of technology and e-commerce companies, including Shopify Inc and Qualtrics Inc.($1 = 1.2670 Canadian dollars)",Reuters

588,"Wall Street's SPAC sell-off drags on amid fears of a bubble
Shares of special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), for months the darling of Wall Street as they attracted unprecedented investor interest, slid again this week amid concerns that their valuations have become inflated.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-spac/wall-streets-spac-sell-off-drags-on-amid-fears-of-a-bubble-idUSKBN2AX1MA,"(Reuters) - Shares of special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), for months the darling of Wall Street as they attracted unprecedented investor interest, slid again this week amid concerns that their valuations have become inflated.The Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks SPACs, was down more than 6% in morning trading on Friday and is on track for its biggest weekly drop since it launched in October.A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company that then becomes publicly traded as a result. For the company merging with a SPAC, it is an alternative to doing an IPO itself.SPACs gained immense popularity last year among amateur retail traders as well as Wall Street funds that are hoping to ride the coattails of prominent investors who have raised SPACs, such as hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and serial blank-check dealmaker Chamath Palihapitiya.SPACs have increasingly focused on deals in industries of the future such as electric vehicles, self-driving cars and space exploration. They are seen as having lucrative potential but are also fraught with uncertainty.The trigger for the recent sell-off was the announcement last month of Churchill Capital IV Corp’s long-awaited merger with electric vehicle company Lucid Motors.The stock had run up more than 500% in anticipation of the deal, but it slumped more than 40% on the announcement as investors became more skeptical about the prospects of a company that has yet to produce cars regularly.Since then, broader concerns over frothy valuations have spread to other popular names that have done SPAC deals, such as sports betting platform DraftKings Inc and QuantumScape, a maker of batteries for electric vehicles.QuantumScape, which has said it does not expect to generate an operating profit until 2027, saw its market cap hit a high of almost $45 billion in December. It has since lost 72% of its market value.In a further hit to SPACs, Palihapitiya, one of the most high-profile SPAC investors, sold his remaining personal stake in space tourism startup Virgin Galactic Holdings for around $213 million.London Stock Exchange (LSE) Chief Executive David Schwimmer warned on Friday that the “frothy” U.S. market for SPACs could see investors coming off “poorly”. A British government review this week recommended making it easier for SPACs to list on the LSE.While SPACs allow private companies to list more quickly than a conventional initial public offering process, critics have asked questions about a possible misalignment of incentives by SPAC promoters in some cases.A two-year study ended January by JP Morgan Asset Management bit.ly/3kUZx19 showed SPAC sponsors earned returns of 958% on average, compared to an average gross return of just 90% for ""buy and hold"" SPAC investors.",Reuters

In December it said monetary policy would not change until there has been “substantial further progress” towards restoring maximum employment and reaching its inflation goal.Some metrics have improved since then. But the U.S. central bank now views maximum employment through a broader lens than before, and its aspirations took a step backward as the unemployment rate for Blacks actually rose in February - widening the gulf between the white and Black jobless rates for the first time since August. In fact, Blacks were the only racial or ethnic group to see an employment decline.Education levels were another point of disparity. All of February’s job gains were among people with at least some college education. Those without lost ground.Graphic: Substantial further progress for the Fed? -There were signs of traction, however, in an economy that forecasters feel will at some point begin to rocket ahead as the impact of vaccinations is felt and life returns to normal. The bulk of the job gains last month were in the leisure and hospitality industry hardest hit by the pandemic in 2020.Data from employee time management firm Homebase saw what the firm felt were signs of a spring thaw coming for restaurants and small businesses.Graphic: Jobs in real time -Shift work across a variety of industries also rose in February, according to data from time management firm UKG, and the pace appeared to increase in the second half of the month.“The jobs recovery is poised to accelerate in the coming months,” said UKG Vice President Dave Gilbertson. “March, which marks one year since shutdowns began, will set the stage for the spring recovery outlook.”",Reuters

German city Osnabrueck fears it will lose 14 million euros ($17 million) invested with Greensill Bank after the country's financial regulator warned this week of ""an imminent risk"" to the lender.

It says its technology-driven approach provided $143 billion of financing in 2019 across 10 million customers and suppliers.Germany’s deposit protection scheme protects individuals but not institutional investors. Greensill Bank has about 500 million euros in unsecured funds, such as those from Osnabrueck and other towns, a person familiar with the matter said.Like the German towns of Monheim am Rhein and Bad Duerrheim that have announced similar concerns about Greensill Bank, Osnabrueck was attracted to the lender because it helped them avoid paying negative interest rates on deposits elsewhere.Osnabrueck, which has a population of 170,000, opted for Greensill Bank because its very good credit rating meant the city could assume it was a very safe investment, local official Fillep said.He criticised BaFin for not informing towns when concerns about the bank emerged last year, saying Osnabrueck would have scaled back its involvement if it had been aware.BaFin said in a statement that it acted decisively in 2020 on Greensill Bank, taking various enforcement actions including the installation of a special monitor. However, BaFin said informing the public would have broken confidentiality laws.Germany’s finance ministry declined to comment. German credit ratings agency Scope did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Parliament’s finance committee has put the Greensill Bank case on the agenda of a meeting later this month.Osnabrueck began investing in time deposits with Greensill Bank last year and currently has nearly 14 million euros with maturities of between April 2021 and March 2022. Its most recent investment was 11.5 million euros in November.Osnabrueck tried to withdraw the funds after a credit downgrade but was unable to, the city said.($1 = 0.8382 euros)",Reuters

Some producers are asking for clauses in their contracts with streaming services to protect them from lawsuits.“It’s just too much of a risk and not worth the headache, especially if you are being threatened with jail,” a producer said.",Reuters

Let’s get the vaccine instead, right?” Harris said in excerpts from an MSNBC interview.“We know Black people are disproportionately likely to contract the virus and die from it,” Harris said. “We know when you look at who the frontline workers are, who is the most at risk disproportionately. We are talking about people of color.”Blacks and Hispanics have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19 with a disproportionate number of deaths, and public health officials have broadly called for equity in vaccine distribution.Harris, the first Black and Asian U.S. vice president, noted that Black small businesses were also being affected, with 40% going out of business.“It is disproportionately affecting us and if we want to get control of this virus that is harming us at a disproportionate rate, part of it is to get vaccinated,” she said in the interview, to be broadcast in full on Saturday.Early data on U.S. coronavirus vaccinations suggested that Blacks and Hispanics received a smaller proportion of shots than their representation among healthcare workers and nursing home residents, two priority groups for COVID-19 inoculations.Enrollment of Black Americans in clinical trials was also a particular challenge. Mistrust runs high, in part because of the nation’s history of unethical practices in medical research on African Americans.Harris’ comments came as President Joe Biden’s administration announced the distribution of 25 million masks to vulnerable populations in community health centers and at food pantries and soup kitchens.Two-thirds of the people served by community health centers live in poverty, 60% are racial and/or ethnic minorities and nearly 1.4 million are homeless, the White House said.In outreach to Black Americans in New York on Wednesday, the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, appeared at the York College mass vaccination site with Black clergy members.Bishop Calvin Rice of the New Jerusalem Worship Center in the New York City borough of Queens said he had been vaccinated without incident.“This site is being opened specifically for our community - Every tube that’s available for vaccination, you need to come and get it,” Rice said.“We’ve seen what our communities look like fighting COVID without the vaccine and it’s painful,” he added. “I believe the vaccine is safe. It is the best tool to protect ourselves.”",Reuters

He had previously said that he was undecided on her bid.“While we do not agree on every issue, (Haaland) reaffirmed her strong commitment to bipartisanship, addressing the diverse needs of our country and maintaining our nation’s energy independence,” Manchin said in a statement. “For all these reasons, I believe Deb Haaland will be a Secretary of the Interior for every American and will vote to confirm her.”Haaland’s Senate confirmation hearing this week was contentious, with Republicans focusing on her past opposition to fossil fuel projects, as well as her likely role as a key player in President Joe Biden’s efforts to combat climate change.The U.S. Interior Department oversees around a fifth of the nation’s land surface along with offshore waters, accounting for around 25% of domestic oil and gas production. Biden has paused new drilling leasing on federal lands, and has said he wants to eventually impose a permanent ban on new drilling and encourage broader development of renewables instead.As Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Manchin oversaw the two-day hearing this week. During the hearing, Manchin said he supported reducing methane emissions from pipelines on federal lands and the administration’s review of the oil and gas leasing program.Last week, Manchin said he would oppose Biden Office of Management and Budget pick Neera Tanden, putting her confirmation at risk.",Reuters
597,U.S. State Department creates position of diversity officer,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-diplomacy-diversity/u-s-state-department-creates-position-of-diversity-officer-idUSKBN2AO2HG,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday announced the creation of a State Department chief diversity officer, an effort to make the diplomatic corps more representative and part of President Joe Biden’s pledge to work to heal U.S. racial divisions.The diversity and inclusion officer will report directly to Blinken, according to a statement that did not say who would be named to the position.Diversity, equity and racial justice rose to the top of the national agenda last year. The police killing of Black man George Floyd in May after years of such deaths sparked nationwide and global protests that highlighted systemic bias in many American institutions.“The State Department has the honor of representing the American people to the world. To do that well, we must recruit and retain a workforce that truly reflects America,” Blinken said.The move reflects a sea change from the administration of former President Donald Trump, who directed federal agencies last year to end programs deemed divisive by the White House. The State Department suspended all training programs for employees related to diversity and inclusion.During Biden’s first days in office, the State Department resumed that training, and he promised more action to heal the country’s racial divide.Deputy assistant secretaries from State Department bureaus will serve on a new leadership council, and the department will soon release a diversity and inclusion strategic plan, Blinken said.The new diversity officer will advance policies in this area and “hold senior leadership accountable on progress. Our goal is to incorporate diversity and inclusion into the Department’s work at every level,” Blinken said in a statement.With 76,000 employees globally, racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented at the department, particularly in senior ranks, according to an independent federal watchdog report released last year.",Reuters

While competitors are still in the middle of the electric transformation, we are taking big steps toward digital transformation,” Brandstaetter said.($1 = 0.8377 euros)",Reuters

Clubhouse had seen a surge in users who participated in discussions on sensitive topics such as Xinjiang detention camps and Hong Kong independence.New offerings include Xiaomi Corp’s reworking of its Mi Talk app into an invitation-only audio service targeted at professionals last week. More are currently under development, industry executives say.ByteDance’s plans are still in the early stages, said two sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.Discussions about TikTok and ByteDance on Clubhouse had prompted interest in the genre from ByteDance executives including CEO Zhang Yiming, said one of the sources.ByteDance declined to comment.The success of Clubhouse, which can host up to 8,000 people per chat room and has seen a discussion between Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev boost user numbers, has rammed home the potential of audio chat services.But similar apps in China are expected to take on Chinese characteristics that will accommodate censorship and government oversight.One such example is Nasdaq-listed Lizhi Inc’s Zhiya app which was launched in 2018 and whose users usually talk about video games or sing songs.The app requires real name registration, a trait Lizhi CEO Marco Lai says is key in China. Audio livestreaming companies in China employ staff to listen to conversations in every room and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to weed out “inappropriate” content, such as pornography or politically sensitive issues, he said.A Lizhi spokeswoman said Zhiya uses humans as well as AI tools to regulate public conversations on the platform.The app was briefly taken down by Chinese regulators in 2019, but reinstated after Lizhi made rectifications.Lizhi’s Lai said that outside of politics there was plenty of room for audio chat apps in China.“Adults in China do not like to express their views in public, we have been taught to keep a low profile since we were young,” he said. “A good approach in China, though, is entertainment, you invite everybody to have fun.”Some new entrants to the market have had hiccups.Inke Ltd, best known for its livestreaming platform, launched a similar app, Duihuaba, this month that recruited venture capitalists, fashion critics and other celebrities to host conversations.However, it abruptly pulled the app two weeks after its debut, saying that it needed further improvements without elaborating.",Reuters

MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dassault-aviation-results/dassault-to-unveil-business-jet-sees-lower-deliveries-idUSKBN2AX0VP,"PARIS (Reuters) - Dassault Aviation took a step closer on Friday to refreshing its line-up of business jets, saying the first flight of its Falcon 6X was imminent and promising details of a new Future Falcon aircraft in “months or even weeks”.The two initiatives are crucial if Dassault is to maintain its grip on the corporate jet market after a development setback, but shares in the French planemaker stumbled as it predicted lower deliveries for the existing Falcon series in 2021.Chief Executive Eric Trappier said the maiden flight of the Pratt & Whitney-powered Falcon 6X would be announced in days. It replaces the Falcon 5X, which was cancelled in 2017 when France’s Safran failed to develop a new engine on time.The first example of the large-cabin jet will be delivered at the end of 2022, he told a news conference.He said Dassault continues to back a business model split between Falcon business jets and France’s Rafale fighter.Its 2020 results were overshadowed by lower demand for Falcon jets as well as a lower contribution from 35%-owned French arms and aerospace firm Thales, which suspended its dividend amid the pandemic last year.Adjusted operating income more than halved to 261 million euros ($311.06 million) from 765 million as revenues fell 25% to 5.49 billion.Dassault delivered an already reported total of 34 Falcon jets in 2020, trailing rivals Bombardier and General Dynamics’ Gulfstream, with more than 100 each.For 2021, Dassault predicted 25 Falcon deliveries, pushing its shares down more than 1%, analysts said. It also predicted 25 Rafale deliveries, up from 13 last year.Business aviation has recovered faster from the pandemic than commercial airlines, helped by demand from first-time buyers, leisure travel, and wealthy individuals who fear flying in larger commercial jets due to COVID-19.But deliveries declined 20.4% globally to 644 aircraft in 2020, with corporate planemakers expecting a full recovery could take years.($1 = 0.8391 euros)",Reuters
603,"Greensill's funding problems could cause broad ripples
(This March.4 story corrects paragraph three to make clear that GAM Holdings closure of the fund related to concerns about perceptions of supply chain finance rather than about asset valuations)
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-credit-suisse-gp-greensill-analysis/greensills-funding-problems-could-cause-broad-ripples-idUSKBN2AW16B,"(This March.4 story corrects paragraph three to make clear that GAM Holdings closure of the fund related to concerns about perceptions of supply chain finance rather than about asset valuations)LONDON (Reuters) - A funding crisis at Greensill Capital could spill over to some of its high-risk borrowers and lead to losses for insurers and banks that have done business with the UK-based supply chain finance firm if its clients default, according to several industry experts and a review of public filings.Greensill, backed by Softbank Group Corp’s Vision Fund, helps companies spread out the time they have to pay their bills. The loans, which typically have maturities of up to 90 days, are securitized and sold to investors, allowing Greensill to make new loans.Earlier this week, Greensill’s primary source of funding came to an abrupt halt. Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG and asset manager GAM Holdings AG suspended redemptions from funds that held most of their around $10 billion in assets in Greensill notes. Credit Suisse said it was concerned about being able to accurately value them, while GAM cited “media coverage related to supply chain finance.”Greensill is preparing to file for bankruptcy and is also in talks to sell large parts of its business to private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc, a source close to Greensill said on Wednesday. But Apollo is not planning to bail out Greensill’s borrowers and does not even want to provide loan arrangement services to Greensill’s riskier clients, two sources close to the talks said, because of the financial and reputational risks.While Greensill did not name Apollo, it confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with “a leading global financial institution” to buy its business. Apollo, Softbank and Credit Suisse declined to comment.The uncertainty about what happens over the next few days could ripple through Greensill’s clients and other financial institutions.For the company’s clients, an inability of Greensill to continue funding them may mean having to repay debts soon and finding alternative sources of financing in the near term, according to four experts in short term, inventory-backed - or ‘supply chain’ - financing of the type Greensill offers.That could be especially problematic for its higher-risk clients, which may struggle to raise funds elsewhere or have to pay much more for the financing.“If you have just a single source for this kind of capital, you may have to scramble around,” said Craig Jeffrey, of consultancy Strategic Treasurer, near Atlanta, which advises clients on supply chain finance.Any inability of borrowers to pay could, in turn, lead to losses for credit insurers that have sold protection against defaults on Greensill securities bought by the Credit Suisse funds. And if those insurers don’t pay up, investors could sue Credit Suisse to cover their losses, said Thorsten Beck, finance professor at the University of London. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a research note this week that even if the Swiss bank doesn’t face direct financial losses, it would face reputational damage from the crisis.In addition, a bank owned by Greensill in Germany, which keeps the company’s short-term loans on its balance sheet before they are securitized and sold to Credit Suisse, could also be on the hook for losses if the sudden withdrawal of credit prompts any defaults on debts it was temporarily holding, according to ratings reports and published accounts.On Wednesday, Germany’s financial regulator Bafin filed a criminal complaint against Bremen-based Greensill Bank saying the lender could not provide evidence of receivables it said it had purchased from metals-to-finance group GFG Alliance.In a statement to Reuters, Greensill Capital spokesman James Doran said talks were ongoing with a suitor on a deal for parts of its business which could help preserve operations and jobs. “While the structure of the new business is still being determined, we expect the transaction will ensure the majority of Greensill clients will continue to be funded in the same way as they currently are while also preserving a substantial number of jobs.”Greensill Bank always “seeks external legal and audit advice before booking any new asset,” Greensill Capital added. It declined to comment on the specific Bafin allegation. GFG did not respond to requests for comment about Greensill Bank.The supply chain lending model is usually seen as a relatively low-risk investment. But Greensill, formed in 2011 by former Citigroup banker Lex Greensill, has taken on some highly indebted customers, publicly available accounts for borrowers show. It has also lent money to fund fixed assets like buildings and factories, which are more typically funded via longer-term financing, the accounts show, whereas supply chain financing usually covers short-term debts like paying for inventory.One of its largest customers is GFG, run by Indian-British metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta. GFG Alliance had to pay a 12% interest rate when it issued debt on public markets in 2019.But Greensill said his business typically provided credit to businesses for around 4%, and could do so because investors would accept low returns as he ensured debts were backed by assets which would be quickly realized.Reuters could not learn the specific rate that Greensill charged GFG and how much of the Credit Suisse and GAM funds’ assets are accounted for by GFG loans. Previous accounts for the funds and the companies involved show hundreds of millions of dollars of outstanding credit at any one time.GFG Alliance spokesman Andrew Mitchell said the group had alternative funders to Greensill.“GFG Alliance has adequate current funds and its plans to bring in fresh capital through refinancing are progressing well,” he said, adding the troubled companies GFG bought were being turned around and were generating positive cashflow.Any customer defaults could also impact Greensill Bank in Bremen, Germany, a review of ratings reports and published accounts shows. The bank’s exposure to GFG is unclear but its most recent capital requirements disclosures show that in 2019, it took on over $1 billion in exposures in Macedonia, the Czech Republic and Romania, after GFG began doing business in these countries.Greensill Bank is largely funded by around 3 billion euros of deposits and depositors are protected by the bank’s membership of the deposit protection fund of the Federal Association of German Banks.Greensill Bank declined to answer questions about its finances and neither it or Credit Suisse disclose its exposure to individual companies.Any losses to the Credit Suisse funds could also flow to multiple parties. Credit insurers have sold the Credit Suisse funds and Greensill protection against defaults on Greensill securities bought by the funds. While Greensill Capital is responsible for first losses on the funds to the tune of $1 billion, accounts show, insurers cover much of the rest, Credit Suisse said in January.Credit Suisse declined to confirm whether the debts currently in the fund are covered by insurance and who covered them.Credit Suisse, too, is a creditor to Greensill. The Zurich-based bank has $140 million in loans outstanding to the company, a source familiar with the matter said.Greensill declined to say if sale talks envisaged the potential buyer taking on its debts or those debts held by the Credit Suisse funds. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the debt.",Reuters

In December, payrolls fell for the first time in eight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast February payrolls increasing by 182,000 jobs.Though the unemployment rate fell to 6.2% last month from 6.3% in January, it continues to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being “employed but absent from work.”STOCKS: The S&P 500 was 1.03% higher after the openBONDS: Yields on benchmark 10-year notes rose above 1.62% for the first time in a year, and were last at 1.5940%. Two-year Treasury yields rose to 0.1507%FOREX: The dollar index was up 0.32%AMBROSE CROFTON, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, LONDON“While today’s US jobs report was better than expected, it also reminds us that there is still a long runway for the economic recovery to take-off in the coming quarters. While 12.9m of the 22.4m jobs lost from the pandemic have been recovered, that still leaves employment 6% below its pre-pandemic peak. With employment in the hospitality and leisure industry still 3.5m lower than a year ago, the jobs recovery may be quicker than in the past, once the vaccines allow for a strong rebound in that sector.“It’s no wonder that the Treasury market’s confidence in the recovery has been growing, leading to yields moving sharply higher: the vaccine rollout is proceeding well, the US consumer has accumulated excess savings of 8% of GDP in 2020 and there is a proposed stimulus of $1.9tn (9% of GDP) in the pipeline. This can fuel the economic recovery for many quarters to come and rapidly accelerate job gains.“But you can have too much of a good thing and the sharp move higher in Treasury yields has recently caused some indigestion in the equity markets that had previously been buoyed by low interest rates. However, investors should take comfort from Chair Powell’s hints yesterday – should markets become disorderly, then action would be taken to maintain favourable financial conditions and keep the economy on the path to full employment.”JUSTIN HOOGENDOORN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME, PIPER SANDLER FINANCIAL STRATEGIES, CHICAGO“As the economy reopens, we are beginning to see significant legs to the reflation story. This strong NFP bolsters the story, which is pressing the Fed to move up the timeline for rate hikes. I am not sure that the Fed is going to be pressing rates higher anytime soon, but the thought certainly is pressuring the belly of the curve. I believe that the Fed will begin to taper its balance sheet growth in the near future to take some upward pressure off of rates. The 49 bp of curve roll down for investors over the next two years from the 5-year to the 3-year is going to be tempting for investors, as it matches the highest pickup over the past five years. “STEVE RICK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CUNA MUTUAL GROUP, MADISON, WISCONSIN (email)“While it is a hopeful sign that these jobs numbers topped expectations, we still have a ways to go before we start to see real, upward economic momentum for Main Street here. Progression on the vaccine front is a real source of optimism, but ultimately, I think it could take over two years to return to pre-COVID labor market conditions.”“It’s definitely bond-bearish in the very near-term. However, the rates market is now priced for Fed liftoff near the end of 2022. Employment growth will have to be even stronger going forward – at least +400k to +500k per month – in order for the Fed to hit its “maximum employment” goal by then, justifying current market pricing.PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK“I was surprised. It’s just a number that’s reflecting that the economy is beginning to open up due to the vaccine.“The key is there’s no rate inflation in sight.“This poses the question: do we really need a stimulus package? You still have 10 million out of work and those people need assistance. Could there be a last-minute adjustment to this package? That’s a possibility. But they’ve got to be careful they could overheat the economy. The Fed said inflation could be temporary but there’s a possibility what the Fed’s saying could be challenged. And that’s what the bond market is telling us.“This is good news for Main Street but not necessarily for Wall Street. It means that we might see yields spike a little higher than anticipated. If these rates spike to a 52-week high, there’s a possibility that this relief rally that we’re seeing now is going to be challenged.”JOSEPH LAVORGNA, AMERICAS CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, NEW YORK“It’s an unusual report because job gains were predominantly in leisure and hospitality, it’s up 355,000.“What’s really interesting is the diffusion index which measures job breadth was only 57%. Normally with what would appear to be a blowout number like 465,000, you would get 65%-70% industry hiring. So, essentially it’s a very narrow gain.“It’s not a weak report but it’s not anywhere as near as strong as the headline. We’re happy that the leisure and hospitality businesses are hiring, hopefully that’s vaccine and reopening related, but there’s still a lot of wood to chop.“It’s an unusual number in the sense you got what appears to be a blowout number, but it is really narrowly concentrated in leisure and hospitality.”TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, INVERNESS COUNSEL, NEW YORK“It’s a big number. Totally unexpected. Obviously, the reopening is progressing quicker than we thought. This is a significant jump in hiring versus the consensus expectations, and from the month of January, which was very low.“There is significant hiring going on, primarily by private companies. It shows the reopening is on track and occurring faster than we thought. We hope virus protocols are being adhered to in this process. We don’t want another outbreak.“It shows the economy is reopening and that benefits economically sensitive sectors and securities. The reopening plays are not tech stocks, generally, they’re the companies that are most exposed to increase in business as the economic reopening continues.The Nasdaq came very close to confirming a correction during this period of profit taking since mid-February, pivoting to the reopening stocks that have done well on a relative basis.“Stimulus is going to proceed anyway. The consensus is that stimulus is necessary to kickstart the economy and to strengthen the recovery.”“It’s so funny because it seemed like about three weeks ago everyone in the world suddenly thought we could have inflation. Ever since then the drumbeat has been playing and certainly when you see this kind of employment situation, you see January get revised higher, those who have inflation fears, this is a little bit of an arrow in their quiver, if you will.“Still, during this reopening time I am still a little hesitant on the jobs reports. Today’s is a perfect example – you see this month that education jobs were lost pretty significantly across the country, last month almost the same amount of education jobs were gained across the country – so it’s really tough to figure out as the states open differently what is actually going on. That all said, the trend is positive. On top of a lot of the other good news we are getting, on top of the fact it does look like we are closer to a stimulus plan, a lot of money continuing to slosh around in the economy does give some credence to these inflation fears.”JAMES MCDONALD, CEO AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HERCULES INVESTMENTS, LOS ANGELES (emailed)“While Friday’s jobs report showed signs of strength in the labor market in February, there are still millions of people unemployed and the labor market is nowhere near pre-pandemic levels. Even with trillions of dollars of monetary and fiscal stimulus, it’s going to take time to completely correct the Covid-19-driven unemployment crisis.”“Even though the jobs report is a lagging indicator, it gives us a window into the health of small businesses, which are only going to hire more employees if they feel confident about the state of the economy. The better-than-expected jobs report suggests a healthy economic rebound in progress and will likely add upward pressure on bond yields, as the bond market prices in a stronger economy, which may result in more consumer spending and eventually more inflation.”“The biggest risk to the stock market is if the Federal Reserve loses control of bond yields … inflation will continue to exert upward pressure on yields going forward and into the summer months.”",Reuters

He needed a simple majority in the Democratic-controlled chamber to be confirmed.As secretary of the sprawling department, Vilsack will oversee about 100,000 employees responsible for food stamps, crop insurance, land conservation and other missions at a time U.S. farmers are benefiting from high soybean and corn prices but hunger is on the rise throughout America.Vilsack has said the White House wants to tap a pool of funds from the agency’s Commodity Credit Corporation to support on-the-farm efforts to fight climate change, a policy priority for new President Joe Biden.The Depression-era program of up to $30 billion in annual funding was tapped by the Trump administration to distribute billions of dollars in aid to cover farmers’ lost sales due to trade wars, primarily with China.Vilsack must also confront the coronavirus pandemic, which has reduced restaurant demand for farm products and led to long lines at food banks.“We have a lot of work to do as we overcome obstacles created by the COVID-19 pandemic,” American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall said in a statement after the vote.Some slaughterhouses shut temporarily in spring 2020 due to outbreaks of the coronavirus among workers, pushing up meat prices and leading to shortages of certain products.“We found that when one or two processing facilities shut down during COVID, it created havoc in the market,” Vilsack said during a Senate committee hearing on Feb. 2. “We can’t have that.”Groups like the National Black Farmers Association raised concerns about Vilsack’s nomination, saying alleged discriminatory practices continued at USDA under his previous leadership.Vilsack, who was Iowa governor from 1999 to 2007, said at the Feb. 2 hearing that there can be no tolerance for discrimination.",Reuters

Thomas-Greenfield and her supporters pushed back, citing her decades as a diplomat seeking to increase U.S. influence and counteract China’s.At her confirmation hearing in late January, she stressed the importance of U.S. re-engagement with the 193-member United Nations in order to challenge efforts by China to “drive an authoritarian agenda.”China has been working to gain greater global influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership, often by providing loans to developing nations in Africa and elsewhere that tie them closer to the Beijing government.“Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield has a long history of expressed opposition to China’s use of debt trap tactics and its increasingly malign presence in world governance bodies,” Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said as he urged support.Tension between the two superpowers hit a boiling point at the United Nations last year over the coronavirus pandemic, as then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, pulled the United States back from international organizations as part of his “America First” foreign policy agenda.Biden, a Democrat, has stressed his support for multilateralism in foreign policy, not just by picking a veteran diplomat for the U.N. post, but restoring it to a Cabinet role.",Reuters
610,Historic U.S. Interior pick tests Senate support for Biden on climate,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-interior-haaland/historic-u-s-interior-pick-tests-senate-support-for-biden-on-climate-idUSKBN2AN15L,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Deb Haaland, the first Native American ever picked for a U.S. cabinet post, pledged on Tuesday to oversee the country’s vast public lands and waters in line with President Joe Biden’s climate priorities, and was grilled by Republican Senators who want an Interior Secretary more welcoming of oil and gas drilling on federal lands.If confirmed to lead the Department of the Interior, the Democratic congresswoman from New Mexico would oversee more than 500 million acres of federal and tribal lands, accounting for about a fifth of the nation’s land surface, as well as offshore federal waters.“It is President Biden’s agenda, not my own agenda that I would be moving forward,” she said at the contentious confirmation hearing that reflected deep divisions over some of Biden’s climate-focused executive orders. These include a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal acreage, currently the source of around a quarter of U.S. production.Republicans have been battling Biden’s sweeping plan to combat global warming and expand renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. But most Democrats on the panel applauded Biden’s focus on climate, a U-turn from former President Donald Trump’s policy. Trump emphasized oil, gas and coal production on federal lands over the fight against climate change.Republicans on the Senate energy committee pressed Haaland on Biden’s pause on new federal drilling leases. They also challenged her past statements against oil and gas production and her presence at the protest against the Dakota Access pipeline led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy asked Haaland if she had a prejudice against fossil fuels.“Prejudice on fossil fuels perhaps isn’t the way I would describe it,” Haaland said. “I would say that President Biden is ... moving toward the tremendous opportunities we have in diversifying our energy.”Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo tribal citizen, said her own economic struggles as a single mother who relied on food stamps made her well attuned to the job and economic security concerns raised by senators from energy producing states. Republicans and some Democrats from those states are concerned that drilling restrictions or other measures to curtail fossil fuels development would cost them jobs and revenues.She assured her critics that she recognizes that “fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in America” and that revenues fund critical services in states.New Mexico Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich, who introduced Haaland, said she has a track record of working across the aisle.He called her “a true partner for states like ours as we diversify our economy, invest in our communities and remain a global leader in producing and exporting energy.”She noted that the administration’s temporary pause on new leasing does not apply to drilling and other operations by existing lease holders.Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski called Haaland’s nomination “very significant” but raised concerns about the impact of Biden’s executive orders on her state’s resource-based economy. She said Interior has an “outsized” influence over Alaska, 60% of which is owned by the federal government.Alaska Republican Congressman Don Young, who joined Heinrich in introducing Haaland, said despite their disagreements over “carbon fuels” she is able to listen and work across the aisle. He urged the Senate to vote for her because “she will do a good job. She will work for us.”Haaland pointed to the historic nature of her appointment both at the Interior Department and in American history.“If an Indigenous woman from humble beginnings can be confirmed as Secretary of the Interior, our country holds promise for everyone,” she said.",Reuters
611,"Travel industry bets on vaccine passports to draw Brits to the Mediterranean
The race to roll out vaccination passports is spurring competition among travel companies and tourist destinations for the large number of Britons set to receive COVID-19 shots before the summer.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-europe-travel-focu/travel-industry-bets-on-vaccine-passports-to-draw-brits-to-the-mediterranean-idUSKBN2AX11Q,"LONDON/MADRID/PARIS (Reuters) - The race to roll out vaccination passports is spurring competition among travel companies and tourist destinations for the large number of Britons set to receive COVID-19 shots before the summer.Thanks to its swift vaccine deployment here, Britain is the only major European country likely to inoculate a large share of working-age adults by the peak season. They may become the first big regional test of digital health credentials in development.Airlines such as easyJet saw outbound bookings from Britain surge last week as the government raised the prospect of a return to quarantine-free summer travel, and the European Union agreed to develop vaccine passports under pressure from tourism-dependent southern countries.But cooped-up consumers’ getaway plans face reality checks – from unpredictable virus variants to lingering EU divisions over vaccine passports, with France leading resistance from several states over political and discrimination concerns.Britain’s tentative move towards restoring travel “puts pressure on other countries to do the same, which is good for us”, said Grigoris Tasios of the Greek Hoteliers’ Federation. Greece has eased restrictions for vaccinated Israelis and is discussing a similar arrangement with the UK.Tourism from Germany, another big travel market lagging the UK on vaccinations, hinges on Berlin dropping quarantines for tested passengers, Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said this week.In the aftermath of Britain’s departure from the EU, its reputedly unruly tourists are at the centre of a battered travel industry’s summer hopes.Spain, typically Britons’ number-one destination by far, has pushed hard for EU vaccination certificates. The island of Mallorca’s mostly shuttered hotels anxiously await details, their spokeswoman Maria Duran said.“We’re paying very close attention to the UK, the first country to design and share a roadmap for restoring mobility,” she said. Spain saw UK visitor numbers plunge to 3.1 million last year from more than 18 million in 2019.‘DON’T COME’ - FRENCH MAYORAthens is appealing directly to British consumers.Those with shots will be spared tests, with or without the EU’s blessing, tourism minister Harry Theocharis said in UK media interviews.Tourism sustains a fifth of Greece’s workforce and economy, hit by a 76% drop in international arrivals last year and 14 billion euros ($17 billion) in lost sector revenue.Greece’s position, and similar Spanish assurances, contrast with the message from France, the second-ranked destination for Britons – which is in no hurry to welcome them back.“Don’t come,” the mayor of Nice Christian Estrosi advised potential overseas visitors last month as the Mediterranean city grappled with a faster-spreading COVID-19 variant first identified in Britain. “It’s not the time.”As a result, airlines and tour operators are pushing “sun-and-sea” bookings to Spain, Greece and Portugal in a bid to bring in much-needed cash.“The trend now is towards what’s likely to be open,” said Toby Kelly, CEO of UK travel agency Trailfinders, pointing to a “massive pickup in demand” to Greek destinations.“Greece has been the big story, with its government totally behind vaccine certificates.”Without waiting for Brussels, Cyprus joined the rush on Thursday, announcing that vaccinated UK tourists could enter from May 1 without testing or quarantine.Andy Davies, a 43-year-old British company director who booked a Mallorca villa for July after getting vaccinated, said he was reassured by Britain’s reopening plans and “noises coming out of Europe about the vaccine passport”.Free cancellation guarantees on the rental and easyJet flights also helped, he said.“Clearly there are still risks.”‘QUEUES OUT THE DOOR’Whether and how a EU vaccination passport would work with UK and other versions is unclear. Airlines are developing a Travel Pass app through industry body IATA, while the World Economic Forum is working on another alternative, CommonPass. See FACTBOX:Without digitisation, document checks will quickly become unworkable when travel picks up, IATA warns. Even at 10% of pre-crisis traffic, test paperwork is already creating airport bottlenecks as staff spend 20 minutes with each passenger.“Without automating these procedures (it’s) going to be very difficult to get everyone away over the summer,” Heathrow Airport boss John Holland-Kaye said. “All airports would have queues out the door.”Even after the EU go-ahead at a Feb. 25 summit, ambivalence among governments like France, Germany and Belgium could hamper vaccine passports’ deployment.“I would not accept a system that makes access to this or that country conditional on a (vaccine) certificate,” said French President Emmanuel Macron. “Our younger people will not have been vaccinated by the end of June or July.”Airlines are aware of the sensitivities.“I think we should not call it a vaccine passport,” Virgin Atlantic CEO Shai Weiss said recently. “It’s really a digital health app.”A government-issued pass with international backing “won’t come out quickly enough for this summer”, Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary predicted this week. Instead, Ryanair plans to enable medical certificate uploads to its customer app, in the hope authorities will accept them.Without faster progress towards an international standard, more governments are likely to go their own way.French regional airports are usually thronged with the 10 million UK passengers who fly in each year – the biggest national contingent. But they are worried about losing another summer, their UAF association chief Thomas Juin said, unless Paris sets out its own terms for a tourism revival.“The more time goes by with Spain and Greece taking action, the more France is going to be left behind,” he added.",Reuters

Usage is expected to increase further as the government uses it to collect tax from companies.Many of the apps are provided by fintechs, a critical growth sector for the government as it seeks to bolster the City of London’s global attraction after being cut off from the European Union by Brexit.",Reuters

Credit Suisse says it has strictly complied with all applicable laws.A French court in 2019 found UBS guilty of soliciting clients illegally and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion, imposing a 3.7 billion euro fine and 800 million euros in civil damages after an investigation that started in 2011.The bank has denied any wrongdoing. It has so far set aside a tenth of that amount, or 450 million euros, to cover the penalties. It says any fine should be based on the amount of unpaid taxes and not the total funds parked by clients in Switzerland.French prosecutors said at the time that UBS sent Swiss bankers to golf tournaments, classical music concerts and hunting parties to solicit clients illegally, advising them to put their money in Switzerland and offering them methods to shield activities from the French taxman.The bank, the world’s largest in wealth management, said it regularly organised social events for clients and they did not constitute unlawful solicitation.UBS, under the helm of CEO Ralph Hamers since November, refuted allegations it had set up a broad system to target French clients and launder the proceeds of tax fraud by those customers.The case also yielded a landmark ruling in Switzerland in 2019, marking a further erosion of Swiss bank secrecy and setting a precedent for foreign governments seeking information from Swiss banks.Switzerland’s highest court at the time ruled that historical data on 40,000 UBS clients must be handed to French tax authorities, which said they want to use it to pursue French tax dodgers, despite the bank’s concerns prosecutors would use the data in their trial against the bank.However, judges stipulated the transferred data could not be used in the ongoing criminal case against UBS in France or as evidence against the bank.The appeals trial is set to run between March 8 and 24, although a verdict may not be delivered for at least a further three months. Any ruling can be appealed to France’s Supreme Court.($1 = 0.8382 euros)",Reuters

Apollo also declined to comment.“The fund boards have now decided to terminate the funds. Credit Suisse Asset Management’s priority is to ensure a balance between a timely liquidation of the funds and maximizing value for the investors,” the Swiss bank’s fund arm said.Credit Suisse’s asset management arm added in a statement on Friday that it was closing the funds as a result of valuation uncertainties, reduced availability of insurance coverage for new investments and challenges in sourcing suitable investments.Switzerland’s second-largest bank had on Monday suspended redemptions from the funds backing Greensill’s lending operations over concerns about being able to accurately value them, and on Wednesday said it was looking to return excess cash to shareholders.Credit Suisse said the funds had experienced “reduced availability of insurance coverage for new investments”, but declined to say if existing investments were protected.How much money investors in the funds being closed recoup may depend on the insurance coverage for the investments.The funds provide credit backed by blue chip companies but also highly leveraged companies which are not rated by major credit agencies, including Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance.GFG declined to comment on the problems facing Greensill, but said it had alternative financing options for its business.Bond and Credit Company (BCC), a unit of Japan’s Tokio Marine, had provided $4.6 billion of coverage to Greensill credit notes, according to an Australian court ruling which denied Greensill’s request that BCC’s former part-owner, Insurance Australia Group (IAG), be forced to extend coverage.Tokio told Greensill last year that it had launched an investigation into whether the insurance provided was approved in line with company procedures, court documents showed.Tokio Marine declined to comment. Insurance Australia said the sale of its BCC stake in 2019 meant that IAG had no further economic interest or exposure to trade credit insurance. Greensill declined to answer questions on insurance matters.Apollo has already begun the process of funding Greensill’s clients that they intend to continue to work with if it completes the purchase of Greensill’s operating business, a source familiar with the acquisition talks said.The private equity group, which is known for buying troubled assets, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis, plans to manage the Greensill process through its partner insurance company Athene, the source added.Apollo manages the invested assets of Athene, a New York-listed insurer. It will pick out some of the more attractive assets in Greensill’s loan portfolio, the source said.Another source said that Apollo, through Athene, will prioritise Greensill clients with an investment grade credit rating, and anything below that is unlikely to be included.A spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.Credit Suisse said more than 1,000 investors were invested across the four liquidated funds, all of them institutional or professional investors, and it would begin paying out cash from them in installments beginning Mar. 8.Cash or cash equivalents accounted for some $3.7 billion of the four Credit Suisse funds’ $10.1 billion value as of last week, a note to investors showed.",Reuters
615,"Factbox: Health apps, vaccine certificates riding to rescue of air travel
Governments and airlines in Europe are hoping that vaccine certificates and digital health apps can help make travel for the masses a reality again this summer after a year of COVID-19 restrictions.

Many countries require evidence of a recent COVID-19 negative test result. Complying with changing rules is tricky for passengers and airlines.A digital health or travel app would aim to show passengers up-to-date requirements for their destination and display their COVID-19 test results and any vaccination certificate.“These solutions will therefore be vital to reduce this complexity and make the customer journey smoother,” said Luis Gallego, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG.Airports say checking test results, passenger locator forms for contact tracing, and other documentation currently takes up to 20 minutes per traveller. A digital solution will speed up checks and enable airports to cope with recovering traffic volumes, they add.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is working on its Travel Pass app, which will hold authenticated health certificates including proof of vaccination or test results.British Airways, American Airlines and others are already trialling mobile health app VeriFLY on their flights.CommonPass, developed by the World Economic Forum and Commons Project Foundation, is another platform allowing people to document their COVID-19 status.IATA says the apps will enable authorised labs and test centres to send results or vaccination certificates securely to passengers. They can then choose to share those results with the airlines or authorities responsible for allowing their travel.CommonPass says it lets individuals access their lab results and vaccination records and consent to have that information used to validate their COVID-19 status.British Airways passengers opting to use VeriFLY are fast-tracked to dedicated desks to avoid being asked for documentation such as test results already uploaded via the app. The airline hopes eventually to add direct digital links to labs, and to connect the app to its online check-in service.“That would be a really big benefit that our customers are keen to see,” said Richard Treeves, the carrier’s head of business resilience.IATA said its Travel Pass will launch at the end of March, with trials beginning in the next few weeks on London-Singapore flights, in partnership with Singapore Airlines.VeriFLY is already up and running for BA, which expanded its trial in mid-February to include all UK-bound flights. The app’s developers plan to add support for vaccination documents if and when they become a requirement.But Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary warned on Wednesday that any government-issued vaccine passport was unlikely to be ready for the peak holiday season.Many governments and authorities have warned that any digital health pass should not disadvantage those yet to be offered the vaccine. Privacy International, a charity focused on technology and rights, said some communities such as migrants could be discriminated against.The apps have also raised concerns among privacy campaigners and over potential identity theft, hacking and fraud.Privacy International cited “concern that international data sharing of health data will become the norm beyond the purpose of international travel and public-health management”.IATA said its app was based on decentralised technology with no database that confines sensitive information to the user’s phone. VeriFLY also stores critical information on a person’s device and says it can be easily purged after travel.Britain has said it is working with other countries to adopt a clear international framework with standards to provide consistency for passengers and the aviation industry.Later this month, the European Commission will propose an EU-wide digital “green pass” to serve as proof of COVID-19 vaccination or test results, potentially allowing Europeans to travel more freely over the summer.Governments will need to accept the digital credentials as proof of test results and vaccination, global airline body IATA says.“All of this involves government getting comfortable with the process and the technology and, in some cases, integrating it within existing government systems,” said Heathrow Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye.In Britain, those who have been vaccinated currently receive a slip of paper, but IATA’s Nick Careen says it shouldn’t be “overly burdensome” for the National Health Service to share its digital vaccine records with a passenger app.",Reuters

The session high for the global benchmark was its highest since January 2020.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose $2.26, For the week, Brent gains 5.2% gain, WTI up 7.4%or 3.5% to settle at $66.09 a barrel.For the week, Brent was up 5.2%, rising for a seventh week in a row for the first time since December, while WTI was up about 7.4% after gaining almost 4% last week.Both contracts surged more than 4% on Thursday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together known as OPEC+, extended oil output curbs into April, granting small exemptions to Russia and Kazakhstan.“OPEC+ settled for a cautious approach ... opting to increase production by just 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) in April while market participants looked for an increase of 1.5 million bpd,” said UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo.Investors were surprised that Saudi Arabia had decided to maintain its voluntary cut of 1 million bpd through April even after the oil price rally of the past two months on the back of COVID-19 vaccination programs around the globe.Some forecasters revised their price expectations upward following the OPEC+ decision.Goldman Sachs raised its Brent crude price forecast by $5 to $75 a barrel in the second quarter and $80 a barrel in the third quarter of this year. UBS raised its Brent forecast to $75 a barrel and WTI to $72 in the second half of 2021.In addition, the market got a boost after a report showed the U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in February.The nonfarm payroll report “shows that Americans are closer to pre-pandemic behavior that will drive strong demand for crude,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.Traders also noted the rising dollar, which hit its highest since November, was limiting the gain in crude prices. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.However, analysts and traders have said that slow physical crude sales and recovery for demand not predicted until around the third quarter suggest that the price rally is unwarranted.“The market suggests a tightness that does not exist. Therefore, we continue to believe that the price risk is mainly downward and that the current price is overshooting,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, said that the OPEC+ decision to extend cuts as prices move higher could threaten the consumption led-recovery in some countries.The recovery in oil prices to pre-pandemic levels has also spurred U.S. oil drillers to return to the well pad.

MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morgan-stanley-diversity/morgan-stanley-expands-black-recruitment-program-idUSKBN2AX198,"(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is expanding a program to recruit Black professionals into its markets business regardless of their experience in financial services, bank executives said.Last Fall, the Wall Street giant launched the Morgan Stanley Experienced Professional Program, which invites Black professionals from any field to apply, in a bid to improve diversity within the business after nationwide protests against racial inequality over the summer.The structure was meant to cast a wider net to reach qualified candidates typically missed by the traditional Morgan Stanley recruitment process, said Derek Melvin, a managing director in the fixed income division who designed the program.Since launching the program in its fixed income & business resource management divisions, the bank has added a second cohort to its equity research division and is currently recruiting for a third group within its equity sales and trading department.“We’re looking for candidates that demonstrate success in their previous careers and a willingness to adapt and understand the transferable skills that would be relevant and beneficial in our world,” said Sam Lalanne, head of diversity & inclusion of Morgan Stanley’s institutional securities group.The first cohort started rigorous training last month and includes former lawyers, educators and government officials. One new hire spent his career as an aviation mechanic with Delta Air Lines, another was an intelligence officer, and another was a media producer.Less than a third of the group had a background in financial services.Executives overseeing the initiative so far say they hope to see the model taken up by other lines of business across the firm.“The expectation is that the structure and the objectives of this program - of looking for applicants from diverse backgrounds with no experience in finance.....is definitely one that could be leveraged elsewhere,” Lalanne said.",Reuters
619,"France's Dassault eyes Plan B if European fighter talks fail
The chief executive of French planemaker Dassault Aviation raised the prospect of an alternative plan on Friday if talks between France, Germany and Spain on a joint fighter plane break down, but said he still believes in the project.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-dassault-aviation-results-fighter/frances-dassault-eyes-plan-b-if-european-fighter-talks-fail-idUSKBN2AX17U,"PARIS (Reuters) - The chief executive of French planemaker Dassault Aviation raised the prospect of an alternative plan on Friday if talks between France, Germany and Spain on a joint fighter plane break down, but said he still believes in the project.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron first floated the venture in 2017 but it has become mired in mistrust and differing visions between Berlin and Paris as well as corporate infighting over workshare, people close to the talks have said. Spain’s decision to join the project last year further slowed discussions.“I don’t believe it’s in mortal danger but I’m not going to tell you that the patient is not in difficulty,” Dassault’s CEO Eric Trappier said of the project formally launched in 2019.“The head of a company must always have a Plan B in mind. He does everything to ensure Plan A succeeds, everything. But the day Plan A doesn’t work you need a Plan B,” he told a news conference when asked what would happen if the talks failed.Trappier said Dassault had accepted that European planemaker Airbus would have a larger overall share under an equal three-way split agreed by the partners, since it represents the military aircraft industries of both Germany and Spain.But that did not mean all parts of the work could be split equally with no clear leadership, he added.A key stumbling block concerns the control of technologies like flight controls, for which France claims the upper hand since Dassault builds fighter planes and business jets on its own and Airbus has its civil engineering offices in Toulouse.“If nobody is running flight controls it’s not possible, it won’t work: you have to have someone in charge,” Trappier said.He played down a separate dispute over access to know-how, saying Dassault and Airbus had a shared industrial understanding of the way intellectual property is protected. That discussion is mainly being conducted at a political level, he added.Trappier said a merger between FCAS and the BAE Systems-led Tempest project involving Britain, Sweden and Italy was “not on the agenda”.",Reuters
620,"Analysis: After weathering February storm, junk bonds count on Fed protection
Junk bonds, the only fixed-income segment still offering positive returns this year, will continue their outperformance, according to investor bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will eventually put its foot down and calm bond markets.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-high-yield-analysis/analysis-after-weathering-february-storm-junk-bonds-count-on-fed-protection-idUSKBN2AX169,"(Reuters) - Junk bonds, the only fixed-income segment still offering positive returns this year, will continue their outperformance, according to investor bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will eventually put its foot down and calm bond markets.The sector, with credit scores below BBB-minus, is among the riskiest debt categories. But it weathered February’s market storm better than most, delivering year-to-date returns around 1%, BofA indexes show.. Sovereign and higher-grade corporate bonds are in the red.To be sure, corporate debt may face bigger challenges in the coming months.Last month’s bond selloff was fuelled by real Treasury yields climbing to multi-month highs. If that continues, with the rise in bond yields outpacing inflation expectations, this could spell danger as it represents a rise in the real cost of capital.But if central banks keep real yields in check, rising bond yields driven by inflation expectations should support companies.“High-yield (debt) is one of the few asset classes left which is giving you a positive return after inflation,” said Azhar Hussain, head of global credit at Royal London Asset Management.“That is a reason why, if you want to shelter from an inflationary storm, high-yield is going to be the place to come and hide.”A global BofA high-yield index currently yields around 4.4%. An index tracking investment-grade debt from major markets pays 0.9%.On an inflation-adjusted basis, U.S. junk bonds yield 2%, compared with minus 0.1% on investment-grade peers and minus 0.7% on 10-year Treasuries.The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently downgraded sovereign bonds but said it still likes high-yield.Graphic: Only junk bonds left offering return in fixed income -The punt hinges on the Fed stamping on any significant increases in real yields.The facade showed signs of cracking last Thursday, when 10-year Treasury yields rose past 1.60%, causing junk debt to suffer its worst day since November. Junk bonds sold off again this Thursday, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell disappointed markets.BlueBay Asset Management chief investment officer Mark Dowding says a swift rise in 10-year Treasury yields to 1.75% will trigger retrenchment.John McClain, high-yield portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, sees 2% as the pain point, expecting the bond market to “force action out of the Fed or the Treasury” before that.Ten-year Treasuries at 2% would equate to a 0% real yield, ING Bank analysts calculate.Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid is among those who believe corporate debt burdens will force central banks to act. A sustained jump in real yields may push up the premia paid by corporate bonds, something they are unlikely to allow.Another layer of protection is the short-maturity/high-coupon structure of junk bonds, the so-called shorter duration, which makes them less immediately sensitive to changes in interest rates. This was one reason for the sector’s resilience last month.The shorter the duration, the quicker investors recoup their initial investment in the bond through coupon payments. So in a selloff, the higher coupon payments that flow in buffer losses from the bond’s drop in price.Average duration on the BofA U.S. high-yield index is around five years, compared with around seven for the U.S. Treasury index, according to Refinitiv Datastream.“(Investors) have to look for a coupon income in order to face these rises in yields, because otherwise they would lose value. The only asset at the moment that can offer a buffer against these rising yields is junk,” said Althea Spinozzi, fixed income strategist at Saxo Bank.The riskiest and highest-yielding junk segment, rated CCC and lower, delivered 4%-plus returns in both Europe and the United States this year, and outperformed during the market rout.For junk to take a hit, shorter-dated borrowing rates would need to rise, Royal London’s Hussain notes. But those have been remarkably stable, with two-year Treasury borrowing costs unchanged this year, contrasting with steep rises at the longer end.Graphic: Junk bonds vs. U.S. Treasuries -Meanwhile, vaccinations and expectations that defaults will fall this year give investors greater comfort holding debt from COVID-exposed sectors. McClain, for example, says he has “pivoted aggressively to the more COVID-exposed sectors, things like travel, leisure and gaming”.",Reuters

622,Nominee Garland says politics won't influence DOJ criminal probes,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-senate-justice-garland/nominee-garland-says-politics-wont-influence-doj-criminal-probes-idUSKBN2AM13H,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, vowed on Monday to protect the integrity of the Justice Department from partisan influence, in an effort to restore confidence after President Donald Trump repeatedly sought to bend the department to his will.Trump, a Republican who lost to Biden in November, for years attacked Justice Department investigations of his 2016 campaign and Russian election interference as a “witch hunt” or a “hoax.”Garland, in his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, also vowed to make the investigation of the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol a top priority.The next attorney general will inherit a few investigations that began during the Trump administration of the origin of those probes and also of Hunter Biden, the new president’s son.“I would not have taken this job if I had thought politics would have any influence over prosecutions or investigations,” Garland told the panel.“The president has promised that those decisions will only be made by the attorney general, and that is what I plan to do. I do not plan to be interfered with by anyone. I expect the Justice Department will make its own decisions in this regard.”Garland’s promises marked a contrast from previous Attorney General William Barr, who was criticized for his willingness to intervene in criminal cases in ways that benefited Trump’s political allies, from Michael Flynn to Roger Stone.Garland pledged to sit down with department staff, who have suffered from low morale for the past four years amid partisan attacks and accusations by Trump they were part of a “deep state.”“I want to make clear to the career prosecutors...that my job is to protect them from partisan or other improper motives,” Garland said, adding that for now his visits with them will need to be over Zoom due to the pandemic.Garland, a federal appellate judge and former prosecutor, is widely expected to be confirmed as the nation’s top U.S. law enforcement official.He was nominated to lead a Justice Department in the midst of intensive investigations into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters - an incident Garland called “heinous.”Some of the more than 200 people arrested in the siege were associated with groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, underscoring rising concern about future violence from right-wing extremists.Garland has experience in tackling such threats, having managed the sprawling investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by anti-government extremists and supervising the prosecution of the so-called Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski after a deadly bombing spree.Garland told the committee he fears the Jan.6 riots were “not necessarily a one-off” and vowed to devote resources to the probe.“We must do everything in the power of the Justice Department to prevent this kind of interference with policies of American democratic institutions,” Garland said.Garland’s pledge to maintain the independence of Justice Department investigations will also encompass ongoing cases that may cast members of Biden’s family or former Obama officials in an unfavorable light.Amid questioning by Republicans, Garland said he had not discussed the Justice Department’s investigation into Hunter Biden’s taxes with the White House.Biden has made clear that decisions about investigations and prosecutions will be left to the Justice Department, Garland told lawmakers. “So the answer to your question is no.”He told Republicans he expects to allow John Durham, who was appointed by Barr to investigate the origins of the investigation into Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, to continue his work.“I understand that he has been permitted to remain in his position and sitting here today I have no reason to think that that was not the correct decision,” Garland said.Apart from the Justice Department’s focus on combating domestic terrorism, Garland said he intends to prioritize enforcing the civil rights laws, an area advocates say was decimated during the Trump administration.The Justice Department has faced pressure to take steps to hold police departments accountable for civil rights violations, after a white police officer killed African American George Floyd last year in Minneapolis.The killing sparked nationwide protests, but those did little to motivate the Justice Department to open probes into systemic police misconduct or other civil rights violations.Unlike Barr, who told Congress last year he did not believe systemic racism plagued the criminal justice system, Garland was unequivocal on whether the system treats Americans equally.“Sadly, and it’s plain to me, that it’s not, that it does not,” Garland told Democratic Senator Cory Booker.Garland said he would resume using court-ordered consent decrees to hold police departments accountable, a tool largely abandoned during the Trump administration.He also told Congress his support for the death penalty has eroded amid concerns it disproportionately affects Black Americans and other communities of color and that too many are wrongfully convicted.Garland stopped short of saying he will advocate for commuting all federal death sentences, but he did embrace Biden’s support for eliminating mandatory minimum sentences as part of criminal justice reform.",Reuters

Here are some quotes from the hearingGarland told Congress he used to support the death penalty, including the execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, a case he prosecuted. He said his views have evolved due to concerns about executing innocent people and its disparate impact on communities of color.“I have had a great pause about the death penalty. I am very concerned about the large number of exonerations that have occurred through DNA evidence and otherwise,” he said.“The data is clear that it has an enormously disparate impact on Black Americans and members of communities of color.”Garland revealed he will not seek to prioritize marijuana possession prosecutions.“We can focus our attention on violent crimes and other crimes that put great danger in our society, and not allocate our resources to some things like marijuana possession.”“We should do as, as President Biden has suggested, seek the elimination of mandatory minimum. So that we once again give authority to district judges and trial judges to make determinations based on all of the sentencing factors that judges normally apply.”“We don’t have to seek highest possible offense with the highest possible sentence. ... Legislatively, we should look at equalizing ... what’s known as the crack powder ratio, which has had an enormously disproportionate impact on communities of color.”‘DEFUNDING THE POLICE’“President Biden has said he does not support defunding the police, and neither do I.”“I do really and President Biden believes in giving resources to police departments to help them reform and gain the trust of their communities.”“I think police accountability is an essential element of the ability of a police department to have credibility with the community.”“Congress has given the Justice Department the authority and the responsibility to investigate patterns or practices of law enforcement and...conduct that violate the Constitution and laws of the United States... It is an important tool the department has for ensuring accountability.”Garland said he supports the use consent decrees as needed to hold police departments accountable.“Where they are necessary to ensure accountability, it’s very important that we use that tool.”ON CRACKING DOWN ON THE PROLIFERATION OF CHEMICAL LOOK-ALIKES OF FENTANYL:“To be honest, I’m not no chemist (sic). This is one of the reasons I ended up being a lawyer, instead of a doctor. But I would need to look at what would be proposed. But I do understand the scope of this problem, and I’m in favor of doing something, either by scheduling, or legislation, if I’m confirmed, that would address the problem that you’re talking about, which is an enormous problem for enforcement.”",Reuters
624,"Exclusive: Instacart mulls direct listing in snub to IPOs - sources
U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through a traditional initial public offering (IPO), according to people familiar with the matter.

In a direct listing, companies go public without raising money through a stock sale.Shares of newly listed U.S. companies that went public through an IPO ended trading up 36.2% on average on their first day last year, compared to 17.2% in 2019, according to data firm Dealogic.Investment bankers say they often struggle to price in the impact of huge investor demand for popular consumer names, such as home-sharing start-up Airbnb Inc and food delivery app DoorDash Inc, given the limited initial stock float of these companies. Some venture capital investors, such as Benchmark general partner Bill Gurley, say bankers keep IPO prices low to favor their Wall Street clients.Instacart has no short-term need for cash after raising $265 million in a private fundraising round earlier this week. The company’s business has benefited from more consumers shopping groceries online more to cook at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.Investment bankers working on Instacart’s listing have estimated that it could be valued by the stock market at more than $50 billion, two of the sources said. Instacart said earlier this week its latest fundraising round valued it at $39 billion.The San Francisco-based company has yet to make a final decision on how it will go public, the sources cautioned, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential.Instacart declined to comment.IPOs have been on a tear since last summer as markets rallied following the Federal Reserve’s moves to support the U.S. economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet their popularity has been eroding as more companies choose to go public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) or direct listings.There were 208 IPOs excluding SPACs last year, the most since 2015, according to Dealogic. By comparison, 249 SPACs went public through IPOs. Two prominent direct listings last year were those of technology firms Palantir Technologies Inc and Asana Inc.Only a handful of companies have gone public through a direct listing since it was pioneered in 2018 by music streaming platform Spotify Technology SA.U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp abandoned plans for an IPO earlier this year because it did not want to leave money on the table. It is slated to debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) next week through a direct listing.U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc has said it is looking to go public through a direct listing. Online broker Robinhood and robotic software startup UiPath Inc also considering choosing a direct listing over an IPO, according to people familiar with the matter.Robinhood and UiPath declined to comment.Once a company goes public through a direct listing, insiders can typically sell their shares immediately rather than be restricted for months, as is the case with IPOs.A company can also sell its shares in the open market to raise capital following a direct listing without restrictions, typically after it has reported quarterly earnings. Some companies opting for direct listings also choose to raise money before they go public through private fundraising rounds.The NYSE now offers companies the option to raise money in a direct listing after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved it in December.Under the NYSE’s new model, new shares being sold in the newly listed company have to trade within a pre-set range for money to be raised, or the listing has to be postponed. No company has taken up this option so far, though dozens have contacted the NYSE to express interest in it and several are actively pursuing it, according to a person familiar with the matter.The NYSE declined to comment.",Reuters

627,"Insurers rewrite business policies after pandemic legal tussles
U.S. insurers are strengthening language in policies that cover business losses to protect them from future claims related to the coronavirus pandemic or other widespread illnesses that disrupt operations, industry sources say.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-insurance-businessinterruption/insurers-rewrite-business-policies-after-pandemic-legal-tussles-idUSKBN2AX139,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. insurers are strengthening language in policies that cover business losses to protect them from future claims related to the coronavirus pandemic or other widespread illnesses that disrupt operations, industry sources say.New policies and renewals now define terms like “communicable disease” or “microorganism” – something existing policies often lacked, and which led to a flood of lawsuits that insurers have so far largely won.An exclusion drafted by the Lloyd’s Market Association, for example, says insurers will not cover any claim “directly or indirectly arising out of, attributable to, or occurring concurrently or in any sequence with a Communicable Disease.”Another, used by Farmers Mutual Hail Insurance Company of Iowa, excludes losses from even the “fear or threat” whether “actual or perceived” of a communicable disease or “any action in controlling, preventing, suppressing” it.Some companies, such as The Cincinnati Insurance Cos, a unit of Cincinnati Financial Corp, said they are not adding exclusions because current policy language makes clear that pandemics are not covered.“A COVID-19 or pandemic-related exclusion would be like adding suspenders to a belt,” spokeswoman Betsy Ertel told Reuters.Cincinnati has been named in 149 lawsuits for claims denial, ranking it second behind Hartford Financial Services Group Inc, with 222 suits, and well ahead of Chubb Ltd’s 64 and American International Group Inc, with 38, according to data compiled by the University of Pennsylvania Law School.Plaintiffs attorneys are pressing for coverage to apply. If insurers had been required to cover losses from business customers affected by the pandemic, it would cost them as much as $431 billion a month, according to an industry group. Critics have called that figure inflated.Litigation related to existing policies sent shockwaves through the industry because of potential losses. The new language aims to snuff out ambiguity.“Rather than have those terms continue to be undefined, insurers are including definitions to expressly reference COVID-19 or other SARS-related viruses,” said Alan Lyons, who chairs the insurance and reinsurance group at law firm Herrick, Feinstein LLP in New York.Pandemic-hit U.S. businesses have filed nearly 1,500 lawsuits challenging insurers who denied claims, according to the UPenn litigation tracker.Judges have handed insurers victories by dismissing about 81% of the 205 state and federal lawsuits decided so far. But among just the state decisions, insurers have lost 65% of cases when policies lacked virus exclusions and 43% even when there was an exclusion, said Tom Baker, professor at UPenn Law.“Because the governing law is state law, the early decisions from federal courts may not be as predictive of ultimate outcomes as those in state courts,” Baker said.Insurers have argued that business-interruption policies are intended to cover property damage, which the pandemic did not cause, and that their language does not specifically cover infectious illnesses and often includes exclusionary phrases.“The policyholders are not entitled to recover because the virus does not damage property,” said Michael Menapace, an insurance lawyer at Wiggin and Dana LLP who also works with the Insurance Information Institute, an industry association.The court battles are not over, and some insurers have faced legal setbacks.However, stronger language about communicable diseases has added extra security for insurers, whose own businesses have been hit by the economic decline and near-zero interest rates.Plaintiffs attorneys remain hopeful. They point to victories in Ohio and in the United Kingdom, where courts found insurers liable for some claims, even on policies with virus exclusions. The Ohio decision, however, is likely to go through lengthy appeals and U.K. decisions do not have much effect on the United States.",Reuters

It’s really only three or four exchanges in the United States that have halted trading,” he said.Garlinghouse was one of two of the firm’s executives alleged by the SEC in December of personally gaining about $600 million received from the unregistered offering.Financial regulators around the world are looking to decide how they should regulate the cryptocurrency industry.The outcome of their assessments could determine whether cryptocurrencies will grow into mainstream assets or remain niche products.Gary Gensler, President Joe Biden’s nominee to lead the SEC, promised during his congressional confirmation hearing to provide “guidance and clarity” to the cyptocurrency market.While bitcoin is considered a commodity by U.S. financial regulators, most other cryptocurrencies have yet to be classified as commodities or securities.Ripple has signed more than 15 new contracts with banks globally since the SEC brought its lawsuit, Garlinghouse said, adding that he believed the lack of clarity in the United States has been a “hindrance” to innovation.“We’re seeing the activity of XRP liquidity has grown outside the United States and continue to grow in Asia, certainly in Japan,” he said.",Reuters

Republicans, who are expected to use procedural tricks to drag out the process, began by forcing Senate clerks to read the entire bill - a process that took nearly 11 hours.Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who had demanded the reading, was the sole member present in the chamber through most of the evening except for a rotating series of Democrats who served as the body’s presiding officer.Senate clerks finished reading the bill a little after 2 a.m. (0700 GMT) Friday. The Senate then adjourned for the night and was expected to return at 9 a.m. to debate the bill for three hours before considering amendments.With no votes to spare, Democrats tweaked the bill to ensure all 50 of their members would support it. They said they would steer more aid to smaller U.S. states and add money for infrastructure projects, among other changes.But efforts by some senators to alter temporary federal unemployment benefits failed. The Senate bill keeps the House of Representatives’ plan for $400 per-week payments through Aug. 29. It was unclear whether any senators would try to change that, possibly to $300, during the lengthy amendment process in coming days.“The time is now to move forward with big, bold, strong relief for the American people,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.Security was tight at the U.S. Capitol, the scene of a deadly assault in January by followers of then-President Donald Trump, a Republican. Police warned that a militia group might try to attack on Thursday, but there were few protesters around the complex.The relief bill, Biden’s top legislative priority, includes funding for vaccines and medical supplies, extends jobless assistance and provides a new round of emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments. Opinion polls indicate broad public support.Senate Democrats on Wednesday tightened criteria for stimulus checks so fewer high-income households would qualify.The compromise means that 9 million fewer households would receive a stimulus payment than in the last tranche of payouts in 2020. It also lowers the cost of the legislation by $12 billion, according to Senate Democrats.On Thursday, they said they had increased minimum payments to states with smaller rural populations to match the $1.25 billion minimum contained in last year’s CARES Act coronavirus relief package. The bill passed by the House set the floor at $500 million.“Small states will secure at least as much as they did in the CARES Act,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden told reporters. The bill also has been modified to ensure that small towns get a slice of that aid.‘BIG, BLOATED, WASTEFUL’The Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Thune, said larger states like California, New York and Illinois still got the lion’s share in the “big bloated wasteful bill.”“You’ve got taxpayers in places like South Dakota and North Carolina and Georgia and other places around the country that essentially are writing checks to states which really aren’t needed,” Thune told PBS.But Senator Bernie Sanders said the states and cities needed the help.“To the best of my knowledge, state and municipal governments have laid off well over a million workers in the last year,” Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, told PBS.Democrats also included $10 billion for infrastructure, $8.5 billion for health providers and expanded healthcare subsidies for those who lose their jobs.Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the package contained too many provisions that would not directly go toward fighting a pandemic that has killed nearly 520,000 Americans and left millions more jobless.“Washington Democrats are trying to exploit the last chapters of this crisis to pass the most progressive domestic legislation in a generation,” he said.Democrats hope Biden can sign the bill into law before March 14, when some of the current benefits run out.They, along with many economists, insist the United States needs another strong shot of stimulus in order to avoid a slow, painful economic recovery from the impacts of the pandemic.In the Senate, bills usually require the support of 60 senators. But the coronavirus relief bill is being advanced under a legislative maneuver known as reconciliation that allows passage with a simple majority vote.",Reuters
630,"Top Toshiba shareholder gets further support for proposed investigation
Effissimo Capital Management has gained further backing in its push for a probe into Toshiba Corp, but big stakes built up by investors like BlackRock have raised questions over how much influence it and other activist shareholders will ultimately wield.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-toshiba-shareholders/top-toshiba-shareholder-gets-further-support-for-proposed-investigation-idUSKBN2AX084,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Effissimo Capital Management has gained further backing in its push for a probe into Toshiba Corp, but big stakes built up by investors like BlackRock have raised questions over how much influence it and other activist shareholders will ultimately wield.Glass Lewis became on Friday the second major proxy advisor to recommend shareholders vote in favour of an independent investigation into allegations that investors were pressured ahead of last year’s annual general meeting.Singapore-based Effissimo, which is Toshiba’s top shareholder with a 9.9% stake, made the proposal after investor complaints about the last AGM.Reuters has reported the Harvard University endowment fund had been told by a Japanese government adviser that it could be subject to a regulatory probe if it voted against management at the AGM. The fund abstained from voting as a result and later learnt there was no basis for any probe, sources have said.Toshiba conducted its own investigation into complaints about last year’s AGM and found it was not involved in any effort to pressure the Harvard fund. It did not reach a conclusion as to whether there had been any pressure.The vote about the proposed independent investigation will take place at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting on March 18.Activist investors are estimated to hold about 25% of Toshiba’s shares and their dissatisfaction with management saw Chief Executive Nobuaki Kurumatani only narrowly hang onto his job with 57% of the vote at the last AGM.Toshiba, however, was reinstated in the Topix index on Feb. 25, requiring index-linked funds to purchase its shares - a shift that is expected to dilute the influence of activist shareholders in the longer term.Both BlackRock Inc and Mizuho Financial Group Inc have built stakes of 5% in Toshiba, filings on Friday and late Thursday showed - stakes which sources familiar with the matter said likely reflects the need to have shares on hand for their customers.Toshiba shares jumped 6% on the news.But to vote at the March 18 meeting, shareholders need to have held Toshiba shares as of Feb. 1. It is unclear at what point BlackRock and Mizuho began additional share purchases.BlackRock and Mizuho declined to comment.Toshiba had no immediate comment.Glass Lewis also joined Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) in recommending that a probe look into allegations of vote miscounting at last year’s AGM.Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd has acknowledged it made mistakes in the counting but Effissimo says some irregularities have not been accounted for.Unlike ISS, Glass Lewis also backed a proposal from U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, Toshiba’s second largest shareholder, which wants the board to present a five-year capital policy plan or make certain returns to shareholders.",Reuters

China on Friday set a modest annual economic growth target, at above 6%, and pledged to create more jobs in cities than last year, as the world's second-biggest economy planned a careful course out of a year disrupted by COVID-19.

China’s GDP expanded 2.3% last year, the weakest in 44 years but making it the only major economy to report growth.“As a general target, China’s growth rate has been set at over 6% for this year,” Premier Li Keqiang said in his 2021 work report. “In setting this target, we have taken into account the recovery of economic activity.”But the 2021 target was significantly below the consensus of analysts, who expect growth could beat 8% this year. Chinese shares fell.China’s conservative growth target reflects a public effort to demonstrate a return to economic stability after last year’s COVID-19 upheaval, policy advisers said, while also keeping a lid on appetite for debt and risk.“It’s obvious this year’s growth will be over 6%. The purpose is to tell people that we should focus on higher quality growth,” Yao Jingyuan, an adviser to China’s cabinet, told Reuters.While the low GDP target does not mean the government will rush to tighten policy, with many parts of the economy still struggling, it will give planners more room to push reforms.Premier Li pledged to spur domestic consumption and innovation, as part of a plan to reduce reliance on overseas markets and technology for long-term development.As such, China plans to boost annual research and development spending by more than 7% every year until 2025. [L2N2L304E]“The target should be a bottom line. We should have more room for pushing forward difficult reforms,” said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the economic policy commission at China Association of Policy Science.In 2021, China will aim to create more than 11 million new urban jobs, Li said in his report delivered at the opening of this year’s meeting of parliament, up from last year’s goal of over 9 million and in line with recent years.‘QUITE GRAVE’The government is targeting a 2021 budget deficit of around 3.2% of GDP, less than a goal of above 3.6% last year, though giving room to fund infrastructure and aid small firms.Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said continued fiscal latitude was a more meaningful target than the growth target.“The very low GDP growth target is like there is no target at all because the consensus is 8% and my forecast is 7%,” Pang told Reuters.“I believe that most of the money will be used for technology R&D and continue to provide some buffer for job stability just in case COVID will have a comeback,” she added.The quota on local government special bond issuance was set at 3.65 trillion yuan ($563.65 billion), down from 3.75 trillion yuan last year.China also has no plan to issue special treasury bonds this year, having issued such bonds for the first time in 2020 to support the economy.The outlook for government revenue and expenditure this year is “quite grave” given the modest availability of funds as spending rises, China said in its annual budget report, also released on Friday.The government set its 2021 target for consumer price inflation at around 3%. Consumer prices rose an annual 2.5% last year, undershooting a target of around 3.5%.In a five-year plan released separately on Friday, China omitted any GDP growth target for 2021-2025--in contrast to the 6.5% set for the 2016-2020 plan--but it said it would keep its average annual growth over the next five years in a “reasonable” range.Annual growth in disposable income per capita over the next five years will be “in line with GDP growth”, compared with a 2016-20 goal of over 6.5%, according to the plan.There was also no target for job creation over the next five years, though the government said the urban jobless rate will be kept under 5.5%.($1 = 6.4756 Chinese yuan)",Reuters
632,"Analysis: Wealth managers frustrated over bitcoin, anxious for piece of the action
The rollercoster ride in bitcoin since the start of the year has not dampened wealth manager Jim Paulsen's enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency.

This has left him on the sidelines watching the world’s most popular cyrptocurrency surge more than 900% since its March lows in volatile trading that also saw bitcoin lose more than 20% in the span of a few days.“What I like about bitcoin is... its correlation to stocks and other assets is extraordinarily independent,” said Paulsen, who remains frustrated that he cannot own it for clients.The promise of an asset class that behaves differently than stocks or bonds is leaving portfolio and wealth managers scrambling own cryptocurrencies if they can.Many view bitcoin as a good inflation hedge. Nearly 20% of advisors are contemplating investing in cyryptocurrencies this year due to concerns about inflation, up from 6.3% in 2019, according to a report from Citi.Still, a number of advisors say they are unable to own bitcoin for their clients until they can hold it in an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund that clears legal hurdles common for any investment.Should that happen, institutional money could flow in and push the asset class higher, analysts said.BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, said on Jan. 21 it was adding bitcoin futures as eligible investments for certain funds. Fund experts expect other asset management firms to follow suit.Yet the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not yet recognize cryptocurrencies as a security like a stock or a bond, and has not ruled whether mutual funds can own them directly, said Robert Jenkins, global head of research at Refinitiv Lipper. So it remains unclear whether any mutual funds currently own bitcoin because they are not required to disclose it, he said.In the United States, eight firms have tried without success since 2013 to create a bitcoin ETF, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at New York based CFRA.The SEC did not respond to questions for this article.Funds like the popular ARK Invest ETF line that have positions in bitcoin do it through shares of the Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly traded trust that holds a set number of bitcoin units and often trades at a premium to the value of its underlying portfolio.Securities regulators in Canada approved the world’s first bitcoin ETF on Feb. 12, leading some investors to hope that U.S. regulators will shortly follow.President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the SEC, Gary Gensler, spoke in broad terms about crytocurrencies in a confirmation hearing Tuesday, suggesting that the agency should provide more regulation on how it views the asset class. Some investors have taken his appointment as raising the likelihood that a bitcoin ETF will be approved for the U.S.Gensler “seems more crypto-friendly than previous folks who had oversight,” said Viraj Patel, head of asset allocation at Fiduciary Trust International, who has not yet made investments in the asset class for clients but is waiting for a U.S.-based ETF. “We’re really looking at cryptocurrency through the lens of this could be gold 2.0,” said Patel.Still, Rosenbluth said he was skeptical of a product being approved this year, saying there would be a high bar to clear tied to market manipulation and custody audit.Even in the absence of an ETF, retail interest “remains strong with no signs of abating,” JP Morgan analysts wrote in a Feb 16 research note.Overall, cyptocurrency funds and products that investors can buy direct brought in nearly $5.6 billion in assets in 2020, up more than 600% from the year before, according to asset manager CoinShares. Cryptocurrency funds have gathered $4.2 billion in flows for this year through March 1, Coinshares said.“Not allowing the purchase of cyrpto is something that’s frustrating to many advisors, but it’s such a volatile asset that many investors end up doing it on their own,” said Jimmy Lee, chief executive of the Wealth Consulting Group.",Reuters
633,"Western Australia upgrades Crown Resorts inquiry to Royal Commission
Western Australia upgraded an inquiry into Crown Resorts Ltd to a high-powered Royal Commission on Friday, saying it needed to ensure there were sufficient legal protections to investigate the casino operator.

They typically end with a report that may include recommendations for referrals to law enforcement agencies.The Western Australia Royal Commission would be required to deliver its final report by Nov. 14, Quigley said, making it longer than the Victorian inquiry which runs to August.",Reuters

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought a formal end to eight lingering disputes pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the Nov. 3 presidential election including a Republican challenge to the extension of Pennsylvania's deadline to receive mail-in ballots.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election/u-s-supreme-court-formally-pulls-the-plug-on-election-related-cases-idUSKBN2AM1S1,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought a formal end to eight lingering disputes pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the Nov. 3 presidential election including a Republican challenge to the extension of Pennsylvania’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots.The justices turned away appeals by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and Republican members of the state legislature of a ruling by Pennsylvania’s top court ordering officials to count mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and received up to three days later.Three of the nine-member court’s six conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - dissented from the decision not to hear the Pennsylvania case.Trump, a Republican, lost his re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden, who took office on Jan. 20. Biden defeated Trump by more than 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania and the legal case focused on fewer than 10,000 ballots.The high court, as expected, also rejected two Trump appeals challenging Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin based on claims that the rules for mail-in ballots in the two election battleground states were invalid. The court also turned away separate cases brought by Trump allies in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Arizona - all states won by Biden.It already was clear that the high court had no intention to intervene in the cases because it did not act before Congress on Jan. 6 certified Biden’s victory. That formal certification was interrupted when a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. The court also turned down motions to expedite the election cases.Trump made false claims that the presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and irregularities.The case brought by Pennsylvania Republicans concerned 9,428 ballots out of 6.9 million cast in the state. The Supreme Court previously rejected a Republican request to block the lower court ruling allowing the ballots to be counted.In his dissent, Thomas said the Supreme Court should resolve whether non-legislators, including elections officials and courts, have any power to set election rules. Thomas said it was fortunate that the state high court’s ruling did not involve enough ballots to affect the election’s outcome.“But we may not be so lucky in the future,” Thomas wrote.The election dispute in Pennsylvania, like in several other states, involved changes implemented to facilitate voting during the coronavirus pandemic, a public health crisis that prompted a surge in mail-in ballots as voters sought to avoid crowded polling places.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court sided with the state’s Democratic Party and various Democratic officials and candidates who argued that an Election Day mail-in ballot receipt deadline would violate the state constitution’s guarantee of “free and equal” elections given the pandemic and warnings by the U.S. Postal Service over its ability to deliver ballots in time.The state Republican Party intervened in the case to oppose the deadline extension. It argued that the state court usurped the Republican-controlled legislature’s authority in ordering the extension.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, told the justices in a filing that particularly given Trump’s repeated attempts to overturn the election result based on unfounded claims of voting fraud, “the court should not plunge itself into the political thicket by granting a case that will not affect the outcome of any election.”",Reuters

636,"Analysis: Fed's Powell set table for Biden economy, but will he stay for dessert?",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-analysis/analysis-feds-powell-set-table-for-biden-economy-but-will-he-stay-for-dessert-idUSKBN2AM121,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Over the past year Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has engineered the largest economic rescue in U.S. history, thrown a controversial lifeline to companies hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and steered a sweeping labor-friendly revamp of monetary policy that any presidential administration would welcome.Is it enough to earn the 68-year-old former investment banker four more years as the head of the U.S. central bank?That question will get increased attention during this, the final year of Powell’s term, and the conversation may start as early as this week when the Fed chief delivers his semi-annual update on the economy in two hearings before Congress.The testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will be Powell’s first since President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats took control of the White House and Capitol Hill.While the body of work Powell can show Biden on monetary policy is extensive - so much so that there’d seem little reason to replace him when his term expires next February - he may face scrutiny over the Fed’s moves to relax regulations on financial institutions.Those steps were often opposed by the left flank of the Democratic Party as well as Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a 59-year-old economist who is seen as the most likely person to replace Powell if Biden decides to put out a “Help Wanted” sign.Brainard is prominent in Democratic policy circles and has played a key role in shaping Fed policy since she was appointed to the U.S. central bank in 2014 after serving in the Obama administration’s Treasury Department.Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are among the progressives who opposed Powell’s appointment as Fed chief in 2018, as did then-Senator Kamala Harris, who is now Biden’s vice president. The hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, of which Warren is a member, may provide a gauge of how deep that opposition still runs.“Is there anything else this White House could, if it was inclined to, ask of the Fed? Not much,” Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chair who is now a Princeton University professor, said of a central bank that is locked firmly into a pledge to get the economy back to full employment as fast as possible. That’s also the Biden administration’s top economic priority.“Biden is going to be quite happy with the performance of the Fed chair. The market is going to be quite happy with the performance of the Fed chair. (Treasury Secretary and former Fed chief Janet) Yellen will only have good things to say. But there will be Democrats urging him to replace Powell with a Democrat.”Politics traditionally has not been a concern when it comes to the Fed, an institution expected to stay out of Washington’s partisan battles, and one where U.S. presidents have often crossed party lines to reappoint their predecessors’ picks for the central bank’s top job. Along with guiding U.S. monetary policy, the Fed chief is perhaps the most influential official in global finance.Reappointing Powell would restore a bipartisan approach, as well as continue policies that, step by step, have been elevating issues Biden often cites, including advancing racial equity.A moderate by temperament, Powell over the past two years had the Fed delve deep into how the central bank influences the job market. In the end, policymakers not only decided they could do much more to champion the cause of attaining maximum employment - one of the central bank’s two statutory mandates - but redefined the concept as something that needed to be “broad-based and inclusive.”“Powell is fully committed to the president’s priorities of getting the economy back to full employment as fast as possible, and easing the financial stress on low-income households and disadvantaged groups,” said Moody’s Analytics economist Mark Zandi, who expects Powell to get another four-year term.Enter the politics.Powell, a Republican, past private equity executive, and native of the suburban professional class enclave of Chevy Chase, Maryland, was first appointed to the Fed's Board of Governors in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama. He has spent more time than his predecessors cultivating lawmakers here from both parties  in Congress. Those relationships could mean, for Biden, a potentially pain-free reconfirmation for a key economic policy maker in broad alignment with the president's agenda - and stability where it matters.But Powell was also the man former President Donald Trump promoted to replace Yellen, in a move that not only broke the bipartisan mold, but did so in favor of someone with arguably lesser economic credentials.At the time, Powell had hoped to become the Fed’s vice chair to oversee financial regulation, a role well-aligned with his career as a Wall Street lawyer and investor. His leap to the top job was unexpected, and he would readily acknowledge Yellen’s influence over his own understanding of the position.After a year in which the Fed itself has discussed openly its institutional weaknesses in diversity as well as past blindness to how its policies failed many workers, there may be more than a few calls for Biden to put his mark on the central bank’s leadership.Dennis Kelleher, president of the Better Markets think tank and a member of the Biden transition team on the Fed and regulatory issues, said Powell can be lauded for his handling of the current crisis but should also be held to account for the central bank’s regulatory decisions - terrain where Brainard’s dissenting votes “are a very good road map to where and how far they got the deregulation wrong.”For example, under Powell and Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, the central bank has rolled back restrictions on certain trading activities by banks and given them more advance information about their annual stress tests. A Trump appointee, Quarles’ term expires in the fall, giving Biden yet more scope to reshape the Fed.”When you add up the deregulation by the Federal Reserve under the Trump administration it amounts to a significant weakening of critical financial protection rules, and Chair Powell should be required to answer to that,” Kelleher said. “It is not the case that there are just one or two or three people who can do that job.”",Reuters

A Feb. 24 surge in the company’s shares began roughly around the time Cohen tweeted a picture of a McDonald’s ice cream cone with a frog emoji.The tweet left some GameStop bulls wondering online whether it was a veiled message that Cohen would fix GameStop’s business, like the fast-food chain modernized its ice cream machines.GameStop has become one of the most visible of the so-called meme stocks that are closely followed on sites such as Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum.The stock surged more than 1,600% in January after a wave of buying forced investors betting against the company’s shares to unwind their positions, before paring most of those gains the following month.Cohen’s RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop in January, giving Cohen seats on the company’s board.",Reuters

MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Thursday criticized Ford Motor Co for pursuing battery contracts with SK Innovation after evidence had emerged the South Korean electric vehicle (EV) battery maker misappropriated trade secrets from cross-town rival LG Chem.The ITC last month sided with LG Chem in its trade secrets claims, issuing a limited 10-year exclusion order prohibiting imports into the United States of lithium-ion batteries by SK Innovation (SK). It permitted SK to import components for domestic production of batteries for Ford’s EV F-150 program for four years, and for Volkswagen of America’s MEB electric vehicle line for North America for two years.In a redacted version of its full 96-page opinion Thursday, the ITC questioned why the second largest U.S. automaker had continued to pursue battery contracts with SK Innovation “after SK’s misconduct in this investigation had come to light.”It said Ford had sought business with SK even after a company employee in November 2019 was deposed in the commission’s investigation and at a time when it only had a contract with SK to supply batteries for the EV F-150.“There is no explanation in the record why Ford would choose to ignore or excuse SK’s egregious misconduct,” the ITC added. “The fault here belongs with SK, as well as with those, like Ford, who deliberately chose to continue to cultivate prospective business relationships predicated on SK’s trade secret misappropriation.”The ITC also rejected Ford’s request to extend exemptions to Ford’s unannounced new EVs.“Ford’s basis for extending the exemption is to take advantage of economies of scope by using similar SK batteries with misappropriated technologies across several unnamed vehicles,” it said. “The commission finds the evidence concerning the public interest does not support Ford’s request.”Ford declined to comment on Thursday, referring to its previous statement that the ITC decision supported its efforts to bring its EV Ford F-150 to market in mid-2022.SK Innovation has warned previously that the decision would force it to halt construction of a $2.6 billion battery plant in Georgia if not overturned by President Joe Biden.It said on Friday the finding could destroy thousands of high-tech green energy jobs, frustrate plans to protect the environment and “endanger U.S. national security” by making it more dependent on Chinese companies for batteries.“Thankfully, it is entirely within the discretion of the Biden administration to undo it,” SK said.LG Chem noted the ITC ruling found SK misappropriated LG trade secrets “worth billions of dollars spanning the entire electric vehicle battery business... The release of the ITC’s decision puts to rest any questions of whether SK Innovation did anything wrong — they did, repeatedly, and now they must be held accountable.”The ITC said SK Innovation was at least a decade behind LG Chem citing “the very large volume of stolen trade secret documentation, and the expertise improperly acquired by (SK Innovation) from the former LG Chem employees it hired away.”The ITC also found the “investigation demonstrates not merely SK’s eagerness to destroy documents, but also SK’s callous disregard to ascertain the scope of the destruction after the commencement” of ITC proceedings.SK Innovation shares fell as much as 6.3% in morning trade, hitting their lowest since mid-January, while LG Chem shares rose 3.7% against a 0.8% decline in the broader KOSPI.VW has sought at least a four-year extension like Ford.The ITC opinion said “VW’s preference for less expensive batteries using misappropriated LG trade secrets — in perpetuity, no less — is not a compelling public interest.”VW said Thursday the “ruling will only limit competition, reduce U.S. battery capacity, hurt consumers and cost American jobs. Our team is working with the U.S. Trade Representative to avoid these consequences.”",Reuters
640,"Pushed out by pandemic, women struggle to regain footing in U.S. job market
Katy McAvoy hoped she would have more time for her job search after her 5-year-old daughter started in-person kindergarten in mid-November after months of virtual learning due to the pandemic.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-women-jobs/pushed-out-by-pandemic-women-struggle-to-regain-footing-in-u-s-job-market-idUSKBN2AW19Y,"(Reuters) - Katy McAvoy hoped she would have more time for her job search after her 5-year-old daughter started in-person kindergarten in mid-November after months of virtual learning due to the pandemic.But the school near Grand Rapids, Michigan closed again a week later as COVID-19 infections surged there and across much of the country.The unpredictable schedule made it difficult for McAvoy to find time for interviews and networking or to figure out a feasible work schedule.So even though school opened again in January, McAvoy, who was furloughed from her job with a local arts organization last June and permanently laid off in November, decided to stop searching. “What do you say to an employer in that situation?” said McAvoy, 41. “They’re going to hire someone who doesn’t need a bunch of exceptions.”After being hit disproportionately by pandemic-related job losses last year, women in the United States are struggling to get back to work.A slowdown in the jobs recovery, obstacles to securing child care and concerns about workplace flexibility are making it difficult for women to recoup the jobs they lost - and threaten to undo some of the economic gains women made before the pandemic.The U.S. Labor Department will issue another update Friday when it releases the jobs report for February, but as of January, women accounted for slightly more than half of the 10 million jobs that were lost during the crisis, even though they typically make up a little less than half the work force.The hurdles are pushing women to abandon the workplace at higher rates than men: More than 2.5 million women left the labor force between February 2020 and January of this year, compared to 1.8 million men.Vice President Kamala Harris called the exodus a “national emergency” during a video call in February with Democratic lawmakers and activists. “Our economy cannot fully recover unless women can participate fully,” she said.With labor market gains slowing and employment in some industries where women are overrepresented - including leisure and hospitality - recovering more slowly, some women may need help moving into different lines of work, said C. Nicole Mason, the chief executive of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “Some women are not going to be able to return to jobs that were lost,” said Mason.School closures and the shift to virtual learning also disproportionately affect working moms, research shows.An analysis by researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago found that the share of women who were either employed or looking for work, known as the labor force participation rate, dropped more severely in the spring and fall of 2020 for mothers between the ages of 25 and 54 than it did for people without children. Black women, single mothers and those without college educations saw the biggest impact.“Given the persistence of the effects thus far, it would be somewhat surprising to see much of a reversal until schools and day care facilities normalize their operations,” the Chicago Fed researchers wrote in a letter published in January.President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid bill, which was passed by the House, included funding for schools, subsidies for child care costs and support for the child care industry, which is struggling with higher costs and reduced revenue during the crisis. The bill still needs Senate approval.When Alisha Zucker has job interviews, she tries not to bring up being a parent.Before the pandemic, Zucker, 41, spent more than 10 years working in educational publishing, most recently as an executive editor designing the curriculum that teachers and students use in classrooms. After being laid off in September, Zucker is now freelancing and looking for a full-time job.“I’m worried that I will be judged for having to take care of my kids, or maybe they’ll think that I’m unreliable,” said Zucker, who has seven-year old boy and girl twins and a three-year-old boy. “I try not to mention it, even though I think it’s a huge asset. Moms get stuff done.”Flexibility will be key to helping women who need to oversee their children’s virtual schooling get back to work.For jobs with easily adjustable work schedules, such as positions in management, the ratio of mothers working did not change significantly during the pandemic, according to a research paper published in February by the San Francisco Federal Reserve. But for occupations with stricter schedules, such as those in education, women with children saw a “pronounced decline” in employment compared to women without children.Zucker says she is grateful that her husband, a computer programmer, is still working and they have the help of a nanny. But finding long periods of time to work uninterrupted in their two-bedroom apartment in New York City has been difficult, especially with school alternating frequently between in person and virtual.When Zucker has a meeting or interview, she locks herself in the bedroom, using an ironing board as a desk. She is also productive after her children are asleep.Zucker said she hopes to find an employer that trusts her to complete tasks on her own schedule. “I can get my work done,” she said.McAvoy said that when her daughter was doing remote schooling, she worked with her from 9 a.m. to about 1 p.m., helping with assignments and making sure the 5-year-old was engaged in the virtual lessons. After lunch, that left her about three hours in the afternoon for potential job interviews. But without child care she would need to keep her daughter entertained with the television or a smartphone app.Because her husband works out of the home as an audio engineer producing virtual events, he is not available to help with child care during the day.So when schools shut down again last fall after only a week open, McAvoy was crushed. Now that her daughter is back at school, she is using her time to work on a blog about recipes and cocktails - an outlet she hopes will lead to income.But the possibility of school shutting again always looms. “I feel like I’m failing if I’m just putting my child in front of a TV all day so I can do this,” she said.",Reuters

Payments firm Square Inc agreed on Thursday to buy a majority stake in rapper Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in a deal that could popularize blockchain or other new approaches to storing and buying online media.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tidal-stake-square/squares-297-million-deal-for-jay-zs-music-service-tidal-may-bring-blockchain-to-masses-idUSKBN2AW1N8,"(Reuters) - Payments firm Square Inc agreed on Thursday to buy a majority stake in rapper Jay-Z’s Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in a deal that could popularize blockchain or other new approaches to storing and buying online media.Square Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, who also runs Twitter Inc, said in a statement that the tie-up “comes down to one simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work.”Square and Tidal would work on new listening experiences “to bring fans closer together,” simple integrations for merchandise sales and financial tools for artists, he added in a Twitter post.Such new offerings could take advantage of emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies that Dorsey views highly, said Avivah Litan, a technology analyst at consulting company Gartner.“You need the applications to drive the new economy,” Litan said. “No one’s going to just go get a cryptocurrency wallet if there’s nothing to buy.”Among the obscure blockchain systems that Square and Tidal could help popularize are digital files known as non-fungible tokens (NFT) that serve as digital signatures to certify who owns photos, videos and other online media.The provenance of autographs and memorabilia could be tracked by associated NFT, Litan said, potentially making them even more valuable and significant to artists’ fans.Dorsey has supported so-called decentralization technologies such as blockchain because they enable people to store data and process transactions without relying on big tech companies and other service providers that profit off being a gatekeeper.While companies still could develop related businesses, consumers would have more control over what they view and own online, Dorsey said at a conference last year.Martha Bennett, an analyst at the consulting firm Forrester, said companies and artists already trying to sell music directly to fans through blockchain-based systems have had limited success.Tidal calls itself an artist-owned service backed by Kanye West, Beyoncé, Madonna, Rihanna and Nicki Minaj among others, and is available in more than 56 countries. It has sought to distinguish itself from Spotify and other rivals by committing to providing higher sound quality to listeners and a greater share of revenue to artists. But it has lagged in subscribers.“When you think purely about breaking into the market, if somebody with the brand name of Jay-Z and Beyonce don’t manage to break the stranglehold of the well-established streaming platforms then who else can,” Bennett said.Square did not disclose the percentage of its ownership via the cash and stock deal. Tidal will operate independently and existing artist shareholders will maintain ownership, Square said.It added that Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, would join its board.Jay-Z bought Tidal for roughly $56 million in 2015 from Norwegian entrepreneurs.",Reuters
643,"Global semiconductor shortage spurs run on vintage chipmaking tools
Minnesota-based Polar Semiconductor makes chips for automakers and is booked beyond capacity. But expanding production lines to help solve a chip shortage that is shutting down car factories around the world is not feasible - in part due to the scarcity of older-style chipmaking machinery.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-tools/global-semiconductor-shortage-spurs-run-on-vintage-chipmaking-tools-idUSKBN2AW18P,"(Reuters) - Minnesota-based Polar Semiconductor makes chips for automakers and is booked beyond capacity. But expanding production lines to help solve a chip shortage that is shutting down car factories around the world is not feasible - in part due to the scarcity of older-style chipmaking machinery.Chip factories like Polar use these tools to make chips on 200-millimeter silicon wafers, which were state-of-the-art two decades ago. Now, advanced chips are made using much larger wafers, but there is still a lot of demand for simpler, older chips.The demand has been supercharged by a combination of the COVID-19-driven boom in computer gear and unexpected strength in auto sales that resulted in shortages. General Motors Co on Wednesday extended production cuts at three North American plants and added a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Fiat Chrysler owner Stellantis warned the pain could linger far into the year. Shortages forced Ford Motor Co to slash shifts for production of its F-150 pickup truck, a longtime profit driver.Automakers use a range of chips in cars. Some, such as those in infotainment systems, are made in the same cutting-edge chip factories that make smartphone chips. But other chips in braking and engine systems are made using older, proven technologies that meet automakers’ durability and reliability requirements.But the machines to make those older chips can take six to nine months to find, said Surya Iyer, vice president of operations and quality at Polar.“There’s no way I can expand capacity beyond just stretching my limits,” Iyer said. “A real capacity increase would take nine to 12 months, minimum.”Resellers of chipmaking gear saying they cannot find used equipment, leading some buyers to stalk old factories in the United States, Japan and Europe, waiting for them to close in hopes of snapping up the gear inside.“Demand is hot for used equipment, but we don’t have enough of them to cope with demand,” said Bruce Kim, chief executive of South Korea’s SurplusGLOBAL, one of the largest dealers of used chipmaking gear.He said used equipment prices have gone up by as much as 20% over the past six months, while the number of refurbished 200mm tools fell to 1,000, down from between 7,000 to 8,000 a decade ago.Ohio-based Rite Track, in normal times, buys up old chipmaking equipment, upgrades it and sells it to chip factories. But Chief Executive Tim Hayden said the recent squeeze has spurred the company to spend more time sending technicians out to upgrade tools that are already installed on factory floors in order to squeeze more chips out of them.“You just can’t go out on the open market and buy a used 200-millimeter tool - they’re just not readily available,” Hayden said. “So people are getting a little bit more creative.”Demand for old tools is so robust that buyers are looking at every kind of factory. Spin Memory in Fremont, California, is designing a new kind of memory chip and maintains a small “pilot production line,” mostly to provide samples to potential customers, said Chief Executive Tom Sparkman. Even though Spin Memory’s tools use 20-year-old technology, Sparkman gets offers to buy them almost every day.“We haven’t taken the plunge to get rid of it yet, but some days it’s tempting,” he said.Toolmakers such as Applied Materials Inc and Lam Research Corp, meanwhile, are building booming businesses by refurbishing or recreating some of their greatest hits from the 1990s and earlier.“It’s really exploding,” said Mike Rosa, head of strategic and technical marketing for a group at Applied Materials, the world’s biggest chip-equipment vendor.David Haynes, a managing director at Lam Research, said demand for 200-millimeter tools was once mostly from China as it worked to build up its domestic chipmaking industry. Now, he said, customers from around the world are looking to buy or upgrade older tools.Still, investment in older technology lags relative to the spending on more advanced production lines, or “nodes” as they are known in the industry.“Most of the capital expenditure has been going into advanced nodes,” said Tyson Tuttle, chief executive of Silicon Laboratories Inc, which designs automotive chips to be made on older technology. Chipmakers “have always relied on the fact that the digital guys move out of the older nodes, and that frees up capacity for all the support chips. The problem is, the digital guys aren’t moving out as fast. The mainstream nodes are all just jammed.”",Reuters
644,"U.S. 10-year Treasuries borrowing rate in repo market goes negative, indicating stress
The cost of borrowing U.S. 10-year Treasuries in the overnight repurchase, or repo market, went deeply negative on Thursday, analysts said, as investors sought to short the notes, causing market stress.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-repos/u-s-10-year-treasuries-borrowing-rate-in-repo-market-goes-negative-indicating-stress-idUSKBN2AW2LV,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost of borrowing U.S. 10-year Treasuries in the overnight repurchase, or repo market, went deeply negative on Thursday, analysts said, as investors sought to short the notes, causing market stress.Negative rates in the repo market, which is important to the financial system, with trillions of dollars in short-term loans traded daily, partly reflect uncertainty about how long the U.S. Federal Reserve will keep its easy monetary policy.“There is more market stress right now because the market is very volatile,” said Scott Skyrm, executive vice president at broker-dealer Curvature Securities.The negative cost-to-borrow came as investors were shorting the notes in a bet that U.S. Treasury yields would continue to rise, on expectations of increased issuance to finance the U.S. stimulus package and on optimism on prospects of a recovery as the country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.That has boosted short positions on the benchmark U.S. Treasury note which last yielded 1.578%.The 10-year cost to borrow repo rate, which is typically positive, has been negative since Monday and hit as low as -4.25% on Thursday, analysts said. It was last at -0.50% as the Federal stepped in on Thursday to sell U.S. 10-year Treasuries in the market. The last time U.S. 10-year repo rates went negative before this week was June 2020 and before that in March of the same year, Skyrm said.The general collateral rate, however, remained above zero on Thursday at 0.05%, after dipping negative last week at -0.05 basis points.The repo market sees Wall Street’s financial institutions borrow from money market funds and other investors and pledge their Treasuries and other securities they own as collateral. Lenders in repo markets typically include money market funds, insurance companies, corporations, municipalities, central banks and commercial banks that have excess cash to invest.Negative repo rates typically occur when a particular collateral security becomes in demand - in this case analysts pointed to the 10-year Treasury - or there is a reduced supply in the repo market.In order to borrow these securities, buyers have to tempt potential sellers with cheap cash or a repo rate that is less than the general collateral repo rate.On the other hand, dealers and depository institutions borrow cash against long positions in securities to finance their net inventory and balance sheet position.“There’s general pressure on rates at the short end, the same themes that have been in place for a while,” said Tom Simons, money market economist at Jefferies.“Supply is falling – we’re having bill redemptions every couple of days here on the order of $25-$30 billion.”Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities, said dealer positions in off-the-run, or older securities, have grown sharply with the selloff in Treasuries that pushed yields higher. Dealers have attempted to hedge this risk by selling on-the-run or newer securities.“This has driven the cost of borrowing on-the-run Treasuries sharply lower and past the fail rate which is the penalty rate market participants pay if they cannot deliver a security,” he added.That so-called fail rate is -3%, Goldberg said.Some investors also turned to the Fed to obtain collateral on Thursday, with its reverse repo operation seeing $2.1 billion in demand, up from half a billion on Wednesday. Demand in the facility increased last week as Treasury volatility increased, peaking at $11.2 billion on Friday.Skyrm said the Fed loaned $8.7 billion of its $10.9 billion holdings of U.S. 10-year notes on Thursday, easing the debt squeeze.Analysts also said dealers are also preparing for next week’s U.S. Treasury auction with the $38 billion sale of reopened U.S. 10-year notes, especially in the wake of last week’s poor auction of 7-year notes.",Reuters
645,"Texas electric industry financial crisis to grow as more costs surface
The Texas electricity market faces ""insurmountable distress"" as more gas and service bills come due, power industry officials said on Thursday at a hearing into financial fallout from the state's February blackout.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-texas-power-crisis/texas-electric-industry-financial-crisis-to-grow-as-more-costs-surface-idUSKBN2AW2TZ,"(Reuters) - The Texas electricity market faces “insurmountable distress” as more gas and service bills come due, power industry officials said on Thursday at a hearing into financial fallout from the state’s February blackout.High prices for emergency fuel and power saddled the companies that sell, transmit and generate electricity in the state with about $47 billion in storm-related costs. Those costs have led to one bankruptcy and put two retail providers out of business in the state.Consumers facing bills for broken water pipes and food losses will see higher prices as costs get passed down through rate increases or fewer choices in providers, officials said. Future spending on weather defenses and grid linkages could add billions of dollars to the recovery. San Antonio’s city-owned utility expects about $1 billion in extra costs.“The market is facing a financial crisis and it’s a very severe financial crisis,” Catherine Webking, executive director of an industry lobby group told state lawmakers at a hearing in Austin on Thursday. “You’ll see more and more financial distress that is insurmountable,” as bills for natural gas and financial collateral come due in coming weeks, she testified.Vistra Corp., one of the largest utilities in Texas, forecast that buying natural gas at high prices triggered by the storm and selling power at fixed-rate prices will cut its profit by between $900 million and $1.3 billion, Vistra senior vice president Bill Quinn testified.Vistra’s power plants ran between 20% and 30% below capacity because of a lack of natural gas, Quinn said. “Getting gas to them was a challenge,” he said, noting all four of the utility’s gas providers could not meet their fuel commitments.On Wednesday, grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) disclosed 12 energy companies and two municipal utilities were overdue on $2.21 billion for power and services during February.Part of the deficit was covered by tapping internal grid accounts, but the rest eventually will be passed along to all grid users, straining those that have covered their initial bills, an official said.ERCOT has little means to cover the charges, said Kenan Ogelman, the grid’s vice president for commercial operations. It collects money from suppliers and pays generators, typically in four days. Texas may have to consider providing a financial backstop during future emergencies, he said in response to a question.“This event has demonstrated some consideration for a grid instrument,” Ogelman said. Multi-billion dollar service charges have led to collateral calls on top of the fuel bills. The short period to pay both has led to “cascading concerns,” he said.The decision to hold power rates high to keep power plants running even after the emergency passed was management judgment, he said. “In hindsight, it would look like that wasn’t needed. In real-time it looked like it was needed,” Ogelman said.ERCOT normally uses a bid system to set prices but officials decided to set a $9,000 per megawatt hour charge that was about 450 times the price before the storm. It held at that $9,000 level for about 90 hours, leading to 10s of billions of dollars in charges over five days.The state Public Utility Commission (PUC) on Friday is expected to vote on a proposal to claw back some charges for standby power and other services that were not provided. It could save grid users about $1.5 billion, Carrie Bivens, the state’s independent market adviser told the PUC in a letter on Thursday. She previously estimated the storm would push up state-wide power costs by $47 billion.",Reuters

U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Friday he opposes President Joe Biden's nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget, imperiling her chances of getting the job and introducing a new obstacle for the Democrats' agenda.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-omb/u-s-democrat-opposes-biden-budget-pick-tanden-risking-confirmation-and-complicating-agenda-idUSKBN2AJ2I6,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Friday he opposes President Joe Biden’s nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget, imperiling her chances of getting the job and introducing a new obstacle for the Democrats’ agenda.Biden told reporters he did not intend to pull the nomination. “I think we’re gonna find the votes to get her confirmed,” Biden said.Tanden has been criticized by Republicans - and some Democrats - over past harsh comments on social media, such as calling Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell “Moscow Mitch” and saying “vampires have more heart than (Senator) Ted Cruz.”Many Democrats scoffed at such concerns, noting near-unanimous Republican support for former President Donald Trump, who was accused of inciting a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol partly via inflammatory comments on Twitter and was known for blasting opponents - particularly women - as “nasty” or criminals who should be locked up.Manchin cited Tanden’s “public statements and tweets” in his statement. “I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” he said.His statement drew immediate condemnation, with some critics noting that the moderate Democrat - who represents the strongly Republican state of West Virginia - had backed some of Trump’s controversial nominees, including Richard Grenell to be ambassador to Germany.Democrats had questioned Grenell’s appointment because of his past statements insulting to women politicians on the internet and during cable television appearances.Manchin’s opposition underscored the influence that the moderate Democrat has over the ability of Biden’s Democrats to achieve the party’s policy goals, given their narrow control of the House and Senate.His statement came as congressional Democrats look to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill by the end of next week. Facing stiff Republican opposition, that measure could also hinge on Manchin.If every Senate Democrat had supported Tanden, she could have been confirmed without Republican votes since Democrats control 50 seats in the chamber and Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie.However, Manchin’s opposition means Tanden must be supported by a least one Republican.Tanden, who is Indian-American, would be the first woman of color to serve as director of the OMB, which serves as gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget.Questioned at her confirmation hearings about her tweets, Tanden apologized and said she regretted their tone.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised Tanden as “an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent Budget Director.” She said the administration would keep working toward her confirmation by engaging with both parties.If Tanden is not confirmed, it would be a setback in a presidential transition that was already delayed by Trump’s refusal - backed by many of his fellow Republicans - to recognize Biden’s victory in the November election even after repeated court decisions showed there had been no widespread fraud.So far, the handful of Biden nominees to have come before the Senate, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have been confirmed by comfortable margins with bipartisan support.Biden could also install Tanden as director of OMB by making her a recess appointment, a temporary measure that could her allow to run the office for nearly two years.",Reuters
648,Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump in presidential debut on world stage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-meeting-biden/biden-draws-sharp-contrast-with-trump-in-presidential-debut-on-world-stage-idUSKBN2AJ11Y,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday drew a sharp contrast with the foreign policy of his much-derided predecessor, Donald Trump, and urged democracies to work together to challenge abuses by autocratic states such as China and Russia.In his first big appearance as president on the global stage, an online “virtual visit” to Europe, Biden sought to re-establish the United States as a multilateral team player after four years of divisive “America First” policies under Trump.Speaking to the Munich Security Conference, the Democratic president distanced himself from the more transactional foreign policy of Republican Trump, who angered allies by breaking off global accords and threatening to end defense assistance unless they toed his line.“I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined - determined - to re-engage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership,” he said.Several years ago as a private citizen at the Munich Security Conference, Biden reassured participants rattled by the Trump presidency, telling them: “We will be back.” On Friday, he told the virtual online audience: “America is back.”Biden’s focus on collaboration echoed his message during a private videoconference earlier on Friday with the leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, a senior administration official said.Biden plans to join G7 members for an in-person summit hosted by Britain in June. His spokeswoman said he would not ask Russia to join the group, as had been proposed by Trump.U.S. partnerships had survived because they were “rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values,” Biden said. “They’re not transactional. They’re not extractive. They’re built on a vision of the future where every voice matters.”He said U.S. allies must stand firm against the challenges posed by China, Iran and Russia.“The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance,” he said. “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin seeks to weaken the European project and our NATO alliance. He wants to undermine our transatlantic unity and our resolve,” Biden said.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any such action.Biden stressed what he called America’s “unshakeable” commitment to the 30-member NATO alliance, another switch from Trump, who called NATO outdated and even suggested at one point that Washington could withdraw from the alliance.Biden also arrived bearing gifts - a $4 billion pledge of support for global coronavirus vaccination efforts, the re-entry of the United States into the Paris climate accord and the prospect of a nearly $2 trillion spending measure that could bolster both the U.S. and global economies.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined other leaders in cheering Biden’s remarks.“America is unreservedly back as the leader of the free world and that is a fantastic thing,” he told the conference.Biden said the world was at an inflection point, but he was convinced that democracies, not autocracies, offered the best path forward for the world.He said major market economies and democracies needed to work together to tackle challenges posed by great-power competitors like Russia and China, and global issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to climate change and cybersecurity.He took particular aim at China, the world’s second largest economy, and its failure to abide by international standards, arguing that democracies must shape the rules to govern the advance of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.“We have to push back against the Chinese government’s economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system,” he said.Chinese companies, he said, should be held to the same standards that applied to U.S. and European companies.“We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression,” he said.The Biden White House is reviewing China policy across all fronts, including China’s military buildup and trade policies, its actions in Hong Kong, treatment of minority Uighurs in Xinjiang and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the challenge posed by Iran’s nuclear program, Biden said the United States looked forward to re-engaging in diplomacy amid efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.The G7 countries, which control a little under half of the world economy, sought at their meeting to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic towards rebuilding their economies with free trade and countering China’s “non-market oriented” policies.",Reuters

650,"Huawei CFO's argument in U.S. extradition case one for politicians, Canada prosecutor says
Canadian prosecutors told a court on Thursday that it was not a judge's role to decide whether national security and geopolitical concerns can be used to strike down a U.S. request to extradite Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-canada/huawei-cfos-argument-in-u-s-extradition-case-one-for-politicians-canada-prosecutor-says-idUSKBN2AW2S3,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canadian prosecutors told a court on Thursday that it was not a judge’s role to decide whether national security and geopolitical concerns can be used to strike down a U.S. request to extradite Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Meng, 49, was arrested in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant accused of misleading HSBC about Huawei’s business dealings in Iran, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions. She has said she is innocent and is fighting her extradition case from under house arrest in Vancouver.Prosecutors argued on Thursday that if Meng had become a bargaining chip in a trade war between the United States and China, as her lawyers say, then Canada’s minister of justice was the right person to decide that, not a judge.Canada’s extradition process dictates that a judge will first decide whether an extradition claim is legal, before the country’s justice minister makes a final decision on whether to extradite that person.Lawyers for the Huawei chief financial officer have asked for her case to be thrown out. They point to statements made by former U.S. President Donald Trump in December 2018, when he said he would intervene in the case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater said a British Columbia Supreme Court judge would not be able to determine whether Huawei was indeed a national security threat to the United States, as defence lawyer Richard Peck suggested on Wednesday.“Peck can’t prove that’s false, I can’t prove that’s true,” Frater said. “The only thing you can do is presume good faith.”Frater previously called Trump’s comments “vague” and listed statements by other U.S. officials who spoke against interference.“Everyone in this courtroom knows that the elephant in the room in this case has always been the geopolitical winds that swirl around it,” Frater said on Thursday, adding that the defence tried to bring the elephant into court.He urged the judge to focus on facts and law, and “leave the politics to the politicians.”Defence attorney Eric Gottardi acknowledged that Trump may have been vague about the manner and timing of his alleged threat, but said that the president was not vague about his intention to intervene.Gottardi said that more appropriate comments made by other U.S. officials were not as influential as they were all subordinate to the president.“He has the most authority,” Gottardi said.Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing broke down in the wake of Meng’s arrest. Days later, China detained two Canadians on espionage charges, which Canada viewed as retaliation.Hearings were expected to last five days this week but both sides completed their arguments early. Meng will return to court on March 15. Her case is set to wrap up in May.",Reuters

General Motors Co said on Thursday it is considering building a second battery factory in the United States with South Korean joint-venture partner LG Chem Ltd.

Its shares were up 0.8% at $53.07 at midday.GM and LG Chem are in advanced talks with Tennessee officials to build the plant, which is expected to be located near GM’s Spring Hill assembly plant, two people briefed on the matter said. It would be similar in scope to its $2.3 billion joint-venture battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which is under construction, the sources said.GM said in October it would invest $2 billion in Spring Hill to build electric vehicles, including the Cadillac Lyriq.The Detroit automaker said last year it was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, up from $20 billion planned before COVID-19.One source said GM expects to need additional battery plants - beyond the one set for Tennessee - to meet aggressive EV targets through the end of the decade. GM unveiled a bold aspiration in January to halt sales of all light-duty gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2035.Thursday’s announcement came a day after the disclosure that the U.S. Transportation Department will analyze the impact of an electric vehicle battery trade ruling against SK Innovation Co Ltd on President Joe Biden’s green transportation goals in an ongoing trade fight with LG Chem.LG Chem’s battery unit, LG Energy Solution, said in a statement it was in talks to make further investments with GM, but could not disclose the specifics.“LG Energy Solution is also planning additional capacity expansion for other global OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) located in the U.S.,” it said.GM and LG Chem’s vehicle battery-cell joint-venture plant in Ohio will be one of the world’s largest battery facilities.The plant, being built near GM’s closed assembly plant in Lordstown, will accelerate the automaker’s plan to introduce 30 new electric vehicles (EVs) globally by 2025.GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has said the company wants to exceed its prior target of annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025.Most battery manufacturing is currently concentrated in Asia and Europe, while Tesla Inc largely controls most U.S. battery production.",Reuters

A surge in blank-cheque investment vehicle fundraising and frantic pandemic-related trading in 2020 boosted investment banks' income by a record 28% from the year before, a report showed on Friday.

That meant the company’s chip revenue fell short of expectations despite strong smartphone sales from Apple.“While we had anticipated some challenges in the supply chain for Broadcom in the January quarter, its semiconductor business performance did underperform its large-cap peer group in spite of the stronger-than-seasonal wireless business.”On a conference call with investors, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said the company has seen customers putting in orders well in advance as the company’s lead times have extended to as long as eight months. But he said Broadcom believes it can deliver those orders on time.“This is not a panic mode. This is a very structured and reasonable process, which we believe, at the end of it all, still shows a real underlying demand,” Tan said.Broadcom forecast second-quarter revenue of about $6.5 billion, compared with analysts’ estimates of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.For the fiscal first quarter, Broadcom’s infrastructure software business had sales of $1.74 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.64 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The strong software revenue helped overall sales rise to $6.66 billion in the fiscal first quarter from $5.86 billion a year earlier. Overall first-quarter sales beat analyst expectations of $6.62 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Excluding items, the company earned $6.61 per share in the fiscal first quarter, beating analysts’ estimate of $6.56 per share.A ramp-up in 5G technology adoption is expected to boost demand for higher-priced chips used in phones and is likely to benefit semiconductor firms such as Broadcom.The company, which also makes chips for data centers and servers, also stands to benefit from an extended remote working trend as people wait for vaccines to roll out.",Reuters

Pomerantz started on Feb. 2 as special assistant district attorney, said Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance.Pomerantz’s hiring is part of a flurry of recent activity in Vance’s investigation, including the issuance in recent days of roughly a dozen new subpoenas, according to the sources. One of those went to Ladder Capital Finance LLC, a major creditor used by Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, to finance the former president’s commercial real estate holdings, the sources said.Vance’s office has also conducted interviews with Ladder’s staff, one source familiar with the matter said. Ladder did not reply to requests for comment.The district attorney’s office has said little publicly about the probe, but noted in court filings that it was focused on “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct” at the Trump Organization, including alleged falsification of records, and insurance and tax fraud. It is the only known criminal inquiry into Trump’s business practices.Separately, New York state Attorney General Letitia James is leading a civil probe into whether Trump’s company falsely reported property values to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits.Ladder issued the loans on several of Trump’s big commercial holdings, including a $160 million mortgage on the Trump Building, a skyscraper in Manhattan’s financial district.It was unclear what was covered in Cohen’s interview on Thursday with Pomerantz - his fifth with Vance’s office. But it signals intense interest in Cohen’s intimate knowledge of the financial affairs of the Trump Organization.Cohen declined to comment. A representative for Trump and a lawyer for the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Frost, Vance’s spokesman, declined to comment on areas of the inquiry beyond Pomerantz’s appointment.In court filings, the Trump Organization has denied that the company inflated assets. Trump, a Republican, has described the New York investigations as politically motivated. Vance and James are both Democrats.To look for anomalies among property deals, Vance’s office has retained forensic accounting specialists from Washington-based FTI Consulting Inc, a person familiar with the investigation said. An FTI spokesman declined to comment.Cohen, who describes himself as Trump’s longtime, do-anything fixer, is in home confinement serving a three-year sentence on charges related to payoffs he made during the 2016 presidential race to buy the silence of two women who alleged they had affairs with Trump.Vance opened the investigation in 2018 to examine the alleged hush-money payments. The probe has since expanded to include Trump’s conduct as a private business owner and whether the Trump Organization engaged in criminal tax evasion among other charges.Pomerantz, 69, was chief of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York from 1997 to 1999 and oversaw a successful racketeering case against former Gambino crime family boss John “Junior” Gotti.As a private attorney, Pomerantz has regularly represented major companies and officials in state and federal prosecutions, including cases brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. He has handled matters involving charges of corporate misconduct, financial fraud, tax crimes and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a federal law used to prosecute organized crime and ongoing criminal activities.Pomerantz, who has taken a leave of absence from his law firm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his involvement in the district attorney’s investigation.Cohen, a potential high-profile witness for Vance, pleaded guilty in 2018 to charges in the hush-money case, as well as allegations of lying to Congress about negotiations concerning a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow, a project that never materialized.Trump and Republicans in Congress have sought to undermine Cohen’s credibility by underscoring how he lied under oath. At his sentencing hearing, Cohen said he took “full responsibility” for his actions, but said the payments were made “in coordination” and “at the direction” of Trump in an effort to influence the election’s outcome.He also said Trump implicitly directed him to lie about the Moscow project.Trump accused Cohen of lying to reduce his prison time.“I think Cohen may be more valuable than people are giving him credit for,” said Daniel Alonso, Vance’s top deputy from 2010 to 2014 and now in private practice.“He obviously has committed perjury.

In hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” the 50-year-old Republican told reporters as he returned to Houston.Cruz said he had planned to stay through the weekend, but had second thoughts “almost the moment I sat down on the plane.”In text messages obtained by American Bridge, a Democratic political group, Cruz’s wife Heidi asked neighbors whether they wanted to accompany the family to Cancun.“Anyone can or want to leave for the week?” she wrote, noting that rooms at the city’s Ritz Carlton cost “$309 plus tax.”With millions of Texans grappling with the fallout from a ferocious winter storm, Cruz, viewed as a presidential hopeful in 2024, faced condemnation after photos on social media showed him in an airport line, in a passenger lounge, aboard an airliner and leaving Cancun International Airport in Mexico.Some critics slammed his comments blaming his daughters, aged 10 and 12, for his decision to visit the resort, where the weather was a balmy 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius) on Thursday evening. The Texas Democratic Party called on him to resign.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki, speaking before Cruz was spotted at Cancun airport, said tongue-in-cheek: “I don’t have any updates on the exact location of Senator Ted Cruz, nor does anyone at the White House.”Millions of Texans remained paralyzed by power and water outages after a winter storm and freezing temperatures that hampered efforts to restore full power.Some 2.7 million Texas households were without heat on Wednesday and leaders warned of a domino effect on infrastructure as the lack of power cut off water supplies, strained the ability of hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients and isolated vulnerable communities cut off by frozen roads.“We need to be here, we need to be in the battle, we need to be helping Texans,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told MSNBC when asked about Cruz.Cruz, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, won re-election to the Senate in 2018 by eking out a victory over Democrat Beto O’Rourke by less than 3 percentage points. He is not due to run again until 2024.In December, Cruz criticized Austin, Texas, mayor Stephen Adler on Twitter for taking a trip to Mexico in December while telling others not to travel during the pandemic.",Reuters
662,Harris taps growing political power of women lawmakers to promote U.S. COVID-19 relief,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-vice-president-women/harris-taps-growing-political-power-of-women-lawmakers-to-promote-u-s-covid-19-relief-idUSKBN2AI2Q4,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met with female Democratic lawmakers and activists on Thursday to boost support for the White House’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, highlighting the growing political power of women in Congress.The virtual meeting, which a White House source said was likely the first of many that Harris will hold specifically with women in power, focused on how women have been affected by job losses, small business closures and a lack of childcare as well as how Biden's plan will address these issues. Nearly 400,000 childcare jobs have been lost since the outset of the pandemic, Harris said. (COVID-19 graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)The COVID-19 pandemic has had an outsized impact on women, who lost jobs at a higher rate than men and have struggled to return to the workforce because of the need to care for children unable to attend school.Specific carveouts in the COVID-19 relief bill are designed to address problems faced by women, including an investment of $40 billion in childcare, paid family leave for 100 million additional workers and an investment of $130 billion to help re-open K-12 schools safely.“For me this is personal.... The longer we wait to act, the harder it will be to bring these women back into the work force,” Harris told the group calling the situation where 2.5 million women have left the workforce a “national emergency.”That compares with 1.8 million men who have left the work force during the same period, according to Labor Department data.“In one year...the pandemic has put decades of the progress we have collectively made for women workers at risk,” she said.Harris said the package would “lift up nearly half of the children who are living in poverty in our country,” a claim backed by analysis by Columbia University.Attendees included House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Representative Barbara Lee and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.Harris has already been deeply involved in policy and diplomacy in the early weeks of President Joe Biden’s administration. Earlier she met with Black Chambers of Commerce and Black mayors at a meeting convened by the African American Mayors Association to talk about COVID-19 relief, and this week held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron.Harris’ meeting on Thursday occurred as Congress has more female members than ever before, with 27% of all seats, more than double the number in 2001. The vast majority of women lawmakers are Democrats, and a growing percentage of women have voted for Democrats in recent elections. Black women rallied behind Biden during critical turns in his 2020 presidential campaign.Murray said women are facing challenges with remote learning for children, so they must get them back into schools safely. “Women are leaving the work force because of this,” she said.The meeting also included Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable; Jen Earle, National Association of Women Business Owners; Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry and Tina Tchen, CEO of the anti-sexual harassment group Time’s UP.“Our economy cannot fully recover unless women can participate fully,” Harris said.",Reuters
663,"Fed's Powell pledges patience, says easy policy appropriate
U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday repeated his pledge to keep credit loose and flowing until Americans are back to work, rebutting investors who have openly doubted he can stick to that promise once the pandemic passes and the economy surges on its own.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell/feds-powell-pledges-patience-says-easy-policy-appropriate-idUSKBN2AW1YM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday repeated his pledge to keep credit loose and flowing until Americans are back to work, rebutting investors who have openly doubted he can stick to that promise once the pandemic passes and the economy surges on its own.With vaccines rolling out and the government fiscal taps open “there is good reason to think we will make more progress soon” toward the Fed’s goals of maximum employment and 2% sustained inflation, Powell told a Wall Street Journal forum.But “even if that happens it will take substantial time...We want labor markets consistent with our assessment of maximum employment. That means all of the things,” Powell said in reference to hopes for not only a low unemployment rate but wage and job gains that flow to minorities and others often left out of the first stages of an economic rebound.“I want to be clear about this,” Powell said in anchoring the Fed’s promise to keep its near zero interest rates and monthly bondbuying intact. Even if prices jump as anticipated this spring, “I expect that we will be patient,” and not change monetary policies that need to remain supportive until the economy is “very far along the road to recovery,” Powell said.His comments, likely the last before a press conference on March 17 following the Fed’s next policy meeting, set aside concern that a recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields might spell trouble for the Fed as investors push up borrowing costs the central bank wants to keep low for firms and families looking to finance major purchases and investments.While Powell said the increase was “notable and caught my attention,” he did not consider it a “disorderly” move, or one that pushed long-term rates so high the Fed might have to intervene in markets more forcefully to bring them down, such as by increasing its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases.“Our current policy stance is appropriate,” he said.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose another 5 basis points as Powell was speaking and signaled no immediate move was imminent from the Fed to cap the increase. Stocks fell.“The market is kind of setting up its own narrative,” of a Fed poised to move to hold down bond yields, said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income analysis at Action Economics in San Francisco. “He didn’t push back as strongly against the move that the markets were expecting.”Some analysts thought Powell in his remarks might nod to the Fed’s ability to more aggressively intervene and increase its bondbuying if long-term yields keep rising.But Powell and other Fed policymakers have made it clear that rather than viewing the run-up in bond yields - which has taken the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to levels not seen since before the pandemic - as a sign of potentially damaging inflation expectations, they see it pointing to confidence in a recovery that has not had much effect on the broader financial conditions the Fed is monitoring.“We don’t want to see a persistent tightening in broader financial conditions, that’s really the test,” Powell said, and so far that broader context remains healthy.It is a potential moment of inflection for the U.S. economy. Fifty-million people have been at least partially vaccinated against the coronavirus, the rollout is accelerating, and economic growth is expected to follow. Families are sitting on perhaps $1.5 trillion in extra savings they may be eager to spend once it is safe.Add to that a $1.9 trillion federal spending bill nearing approval in Congress, and economic forecasters expect potentially record-setting U.S. growth this year.In even the very recent past, that set of circumstances might have led policymakers to conclude inflation was sure to follow, and move to stay ahead of it by reducing the formidable amount of support currently provided to households and firms.But the Fed now sees inflation as a minimal risk, and has put more weight on achieving and maintaining maximum employment, the second of the two goals set for it by Congress.“We are committed to staying on the playing field until the job is done…there is still a lot of pain out there,” Powell said.",Reuters

I think the market would like to see the Fed perhaps come out and say maybe they would begin buying more longer duration and buying less shorter duration rather than the mix they’re doing at the present time. So there may be some disappointments there. You would think with the Fed meeting less than two weeks away that if in fact the Fed was going to make a policy change like that this would have been the perfect trial balloon to sort of message that to the markets.”KATHY BOSTJANCIC, CHIEF U.S. FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, NEW YORK“He definitely reaffirmed they’re going to be very slow to raise rates. We’re far, far away from objectives they have. I’m wondering perhaps that he downplayed the risk of inflation too much.”“Maybe the markets are testing. Maybe the markets wanted a firmer guidance. But this is the best he can do. ““Maybe the other thing is there are no plans to lengthen the maturity of the QE asset purchases. If there was some discussion or even mention of that perhaps that would have helped as well to keep rates from moving higher.”KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS, SAN FRANCISCO“The markets wanted to hear something different, the market is kind of setting up its own narrative. He didn’t push back as strongly against the move that the markets were expecting, and he inserted a new word, ‘disorderly.’ We didn’t hear that last week so that caught the market off guard and that is part of the problem as opposed to him saying anything hawkish or whatever.”“The market maybe was overly, optimistic isn’t the right word, but maybe wanting something more than Powell was going to give. He really can’t side one way or another, especially on market rates in saying that is an incorrect or not appropriate move. He did say the Fed monitors all kinds of rates.”",Reuters

Another directs the government to establish a public-private partnership to form consortia of firms to produce “measurably secure microelectronics.”The semiconductor industry has also been pushing for an investment tax credit for spending on semiconductor tools, which can cost billions of dollars for new factories and typically far outstrip the cost of buildings.The effort comes as U.S. automakers have slowed production on a global shortage of semiconductor chips, in high demand due to a consumer-driven boom in demand for cell phones and computers during the coronavirus pandemic.",Reuters
669,"Exclusive: Amid shortage, U.S. suppliers to Chinese chip giant SMIC struggle to get export licenses
The U.S. government has been slow to approve licenses for American companies like Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc to sell chipmaking equipment to China semiconductor giant SMIC, sources said, as the impact of a global chip shortage spreads.

Certain licenses have been granted, including for small numbers of expensive equipment in recent days.As policy shifts under President Joe Biden, who took over from Donald Trump in January, U.S. government agencies led by new appointees still have not completely decided what should be sold to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which produces chips for Qualcomm Inc and other American companies.The Trump administration placed SMIC on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s entity list over concerns of SMIC aiding China’s military.The listing, which requires U.S. suppliers to obtain a license before shipping goods to SMIC, is unusual because it says most products should be granted on a case-by-case basis. However, equipment that can be used to make only the most advanced, 10-nanometer and smaller chips is likely to be denied licenses.The administration is supposed to make decisions on license applications within a month, but follow-up questions stop the clock.“Lam Research is still in the application process and has not yet received a response,” a Fremont, California, company spokeswoman said on Wednesday.Applied Materials’ chief financial officer said in a Feb. 18 earnings call its forecast did not assume licenses would come through. A spokesman for the Santa Clara, California-based company declined further comment on the licenses this week.SMIC did not respond to requests for comment, but the company has said it provides services solely for civilian and commercial end users and that it has no ties to the Chinese military.Decisions on licenses have been held up as officials ask follow-up questions about applications in part to determine whether the parts or components could be diverted for use in producing items 10 nm or smaller, sources said.Washington trade lawyer Giovanna Cinelli said many license applications have resulted in “a lot of back and forth, which has elongated the period of review.”In a statement, a Commerce Department official dismissed the possibility that curbs on SMIC could contribute to the chip shortage, noting that the shortfall was tied to older technologies while SMIC restrictions relate to leading-edge technology. The statement did not address the potential impact of delays in licenses for older technology.SMIC, the largest foundry in mainland China, is an important player in the global semiconductor supply chain, which is under pressure as pandemic lockdowns drive up demand for electronics such as laptops and phones. Last month, it said it could not meet customer demands for certain technologies and its plants have been running “fully loaded” for several quarters.SMIC’s technological capabilities lag far behind cutting-edge foundries like industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, according to industry sources.Companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research, two key suppliers of production equipment, submitted numerous license applications to sell to the company. The bulk have not yet been acted on, industry sources said.A spokeswoman for Entegris Inc, an advanced materials supplier, said the Massachusetts-based company had submitted 10 applications to sell to SMIC and received its first license in the past week.Other companies that ship to SMIC include California’s KLA Corp and Massachusetts-based Axcelis Technologies Inc . A KLA spokeswoman declined to comment on any licenses and, while Axcelis’ CEO spoke of “uncertainty” related to its licenses on Feb. 11, a company spokeswoman declined to provide an update.Cymer, a San Diego company that makes deep ultraviolet light sources, is also among suppliers that need licenses to send parts to SMIC. A spokeswoman for ASML, the Dutch chip equipment maker that owns Cymer, declined to comment on the licenses, saying she could not discuss customer-specific information.Qualcomm, which uses the Chinese foundry to produce chips with decades-old technology, put in applications for tools SMIC needs to produce the chips, just in case equipment makers do not get their licenses for the tools, an industry source said. But they have not come through yet, the source added.In September, SEMI, a worldwide industry group, said in a draft letter seen by Reuters that SMIC accounts for as much as $5 billion in annual U.S. sales.",Reuters

The United States on Thursday agreed to a four-month suspension of retaliatory tariffs imposed on British goods such as Scotch whisky over a long-running aircraft subsidy row, with both sides pledging to use the time to resolve the dispute.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-usa-trade-whisky/u-s-uk-suspend-tariffs-in-bid-to-settle-aircraft-row-idUSKBN2AW1DZ,"LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday agreed to a four-month suspension of retaliatory tariffs imposed on British goods such as Scotch whisky over a long-running aircraft subsidy row, with both sides pledging to use the time to resolve the dispute.The U.S. administration under former President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Scotch whisky and other European Union food, wine and spirits, which the industry says have put its future at risk.The multi-billion dollar tit-for-tat tariff battle involving the United States, the European Union and Britain relates to a long-running row over state subsidies for planemakers Airbus and Boeing. Britain is party to the dispute as a former member of the EU and maker of key Airbus components.“The United Kingdom and the United States are undertaking a four-month tariff suspension to ease the burden on industry and take a bold, joint step towards resolving the longest running disputes at the World Trade Organization,” a joint statement said.“This will allow time to focus on negotiating a balanced settlement to the disputes, and begin seriously addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from non-market economies, such as China.”White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the decision would give both sides time to work out a solution.“It was meant to de-escalate the issue and create space for a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes,” she told a White House briefing.The tariff truce is separate from broader U.S.-UK talks on a post-Brexit trade agreement, but sends a positive signal about those discussions. Psaki declined to say if the U.S.-UK tariff deal foreshadowed a similar truce with Brussels.Britain and the United States were hoping to reach a trade deal before the expiration of fast-track trade promotion authority granted to the U.S. federal government by Congress in July. To hit that deadline, U.S. trade officials would have to notify Congress about a likely trade deal sometime in April.‘LOSE-LOSE’ TARIFFSAirbus spokesman Clay McConnell welcomed the suspension of what he called “lose-lose tariffs” and said the company supports all efforts to reach an agreement.U.S. planemaker Boeing said: “A negotiated settlement will allow the industry to move forward with a genuinely global level playing field for aviation.”Ivan Menezes, CEO of Diageo, the maker of Johnnie Walker and Talisker whisky, said a permanent solution would help safeguard thousands of jobs across Scotland and the rest of Britain.The agreement to lift tariffs is temporary and applies only to UK goods. U.S. tariffs will continue to apply to EU goods, according to a U.S. administration official.A British official described it as a “real win” which justified a British decision to diverge from EU policy after Brexit and ditch tariffs in hopes of reaching an agreement with the Trump administration before it left office.At the time, the EU questioned whether Britain had the legal right to keep those tariffs in place after leaving the bloc.“I am delighted to say that our American allies – under their new President and his hard-working staff at the U.S. Trade Representative - have embraced our move to seek a fair settlement,” she said.U.S. President Joe Biden’s top trade nominee, Katherine Tai, is headed to confirmation by the full Senate next week.She told the Senate Finance Committee last month that Washington had completed four rounds of negotiations with Britain since announcing the start of talks. She said she would make it a priority to resolve the aircraft subsidy dispute.Tai, asked if she would prioritise an agreement with Britain, told the committee in written responses to questions released this week that Britain was “an important trading partner and ally”.The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States welcomed Thursday’s decision but said it was disappointed that British tariffs on U.S. whiskey relating to a separate dispute over steel were still being applied.",Reuters

MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bonds-fed/investors-seeking-action-from-powell-on-yields-disappointed-idUSKBN2AW0EF,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors hoping for action from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to address recent turmoil in the Treasury market were left disappointed.Powell told a Wall Street Journal forum on Thursday that the Fed remained committed to keeping monetary conditions loose until more Americans are back to work. His comments, likely the last before a press conference on March 17 following the Fed’s next policy meeting, brushed off concerns that a recent move up in U.S. Treasury yields might spell trouble for the Fed as investors push up borrowing costs the central bank wants to keep low.Yields on Treasury debt rose after Powell signaled the central bank would make no immediate move to cap the recent increase in yields. The benchmark 10-year yield was last at 1.552%, up 8.2 basis points on the day.“Overall I think the Powell speech was a disappointment for the markets. While I didn’t think he said anything wrong, the market was looking for more, looking for more liquidity and they’re not going to get it,” said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities.“We’re going to see higher rates because of it.”While Powell said the increase was “notable and caught my attention,” he did not consider it a “disorderly” move, or one that pushed long-term rates so high the Fed might have to intervene in markets more forcefully to bring them down, such as by reweighting its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases, a policy tool known as Operation Twist.“Maybe the markets wanted firmer guidance,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. “But this is the best he can do.”Operation Twist, in which the central bank shifts bond purchases to the long end of the yield curve, was used in the early 1960s, when the Fed sold shorter-dated debt to buy longer-dated debt to help lift the United States out of a recession. It was also used in 2011 when the Fed, which had already anchored shorter-dated debt by holding interest rates at zero, used asset purchases to lower long-term rates.But there are obstacles to Fed intervention.“The absolute level of real yields is still quite low,” said Erin Browne, portfolio manager at Pimco. “Yes, there was a mini sell-off. But from the Fed’s perspective, when you look at financial conditions ... they were basically unchanged for most of last week.”Though rising yields can increase the cost of borrowing for companies and individuals, the recent trend reflects an improving economic outlook, possible evidence the Fed’s policy is working. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a one-year high of 1.614% last week.Powell’s comments on Thursday largely echoed the message from Fed Governor Lael Brainard on Tuesday, who, noting the rise in yields, said she would be concerned if she saw disorderly conditions or persistent tightening in financial conditions.“We think Powell is playing more of a long game. Markets need to see the Fed’s resolve. Powell realizes the best he can do it just keep reiterating that resolve,” said Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory.More upwards pressure on yields is likely to come from the U.S. Treasury’s issuing approximately $4 trillion in government debt in 2021, according to ING Bank. The Fed’s monthly purchases currently total $120 billion.“If the Fed doesn’t do something, then it’s only a matter of time, because the supply just keeps coming,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at broker-dealer Incapital.Still, high demand from foreign investors due to the relative attractiveness of U.S. debt could eventually cap the rise.“I think once you get to 1.75% or 2% level, there is going to be pretty chunky demand. So that will keep the back end contained,” said Pimco’s Browne.",Reuters

Too many Americans were left waiting weeks for important deliveries of mail and packages,” DeJoy said last week, apologizing to customers.Last week, USPS reported $318 million of income for the quarter ended Dec. 31, delivering a record 1.1 billion holiday season packages, while first-class mail revenue decreased by $177 million.USPS reported net losses totaling $86.7 billion from 2007 through 2020.

675,Texas ranchers scramble to keep animals alive in unusual cold,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-weather-cattle/texas-ranchers-scramble-to-keep-animals-alive-in-unusual-cold-idUSKBN2AI1K3,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Texas ranchers worked overtime to haul water and hay to cattle to keep them alive during a freak winter storm, but some cows have already succumbed to unusual icy temperatures that also killed chickens, idled meat plants and threatened crops.The deaths of baby cows in the top U.S. cattle state and struggles to care for surviving livestock are the latest challenges for ranchers who over the past year have dealt with COVID-19 cutting demand for meat at restaurants and shuttering slaughterhouses.In Texas, home to more than 13 million cattle, ranchers said they are spending long, cold hours breaking up ice in water tanks and on frozen ponds so animals have something to drink. Icy conditions have turned diesel fuel into a useless gel in tractors. Ranchers said they are using gasoline-powered pickup trucks to transport hay that cattle can eat and use for warm bedding.Kaylin Isbell, a rancher in Florence, Texas, said a few cows and sheep had died after birth. Babies are particularly vulnerable to the shock of the cold when they leave their mothers’ warm wombs covered in fluid. Isbell said her mother-in-law took newly born sheep into a spare bedroom in her home to keep them warm.The cold will also kill oats Isbell planted for young cattle to graze on, she said. As a result, Isbell said she will need to sell the animals earlier than expected, reducing her profit margins.Ranchers nationwide were already facing higher feed costs as corn and soybean prices soared to multi-year highs.“We just keep going,” Isbell said. “That’s all you can do.”Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told Reuters that baby chicks are freezing to death because there is not enough natural gas to heat hatcheries. He said dairy operations are dumping $8 million worth of milk down the drains daily because milk processing plants are without power. Grain mills across the state cannot manufacture animal feed without power either, Miller said.“We’ve got an animal welfare issue going on,” he said.Major meat processors like Cargill Inc and Tyson Foods Inc said they suspended operations at some plants.In Whitesboro, Texas, fifth-generation rancher Austin Miles said he is filling a red 300-gallon tank with water from a hose at his parents’ home two to three times a day and shuttling it to cattle to drink. The pond they would normally drink from froze, he said.“This is extreme for us,” Miles said. “Our infrastructure was just not quite set up for these prolonged cold periods.”The storm has killed at least 21 people across four states, and temperatures are forecast to remain 20 to 35 degrees below average across parts of the central and southern United States for days.Cattle could suffer from respiratory problems once the deep freeze gives way to warmer temperatures, said Missy Bonds, assistant general manager of her family’s ranch in Saginaw, Texas.“Mother Nature needs a Xanax,” she said.",Reuters

The agency has also launched an effort to update guidance for public companies on how they share information with investors on climate risk and made the topic a priority for 2021 examinations.[nL2N2L11UL]The team’s “broad array of experience and expertise will allow us to better police the market, pursue misconduct and protect investors,” Kelly L. Gibson, acting deputy director of SEC’s enforcement division and head of the task force, said in a statement.Rooting out disclosure-related fraud is considered “bread and butter” work for the SEC, but climate-related disclosures have not been a central focus.The SEC has brought cases against automakers Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., now part of Stellantis NV, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG related to what they shared with investors about diesel emissions. In 2016, the regulator launched a review of Exxon Mobil Corp’s disclosures on climate and reserves, which was closed without action.“Climate risks and sustainability are critical issues for the investing public and our capital markets,” SEC Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement.ESG funds have attracted a higher percentage of inflows than other equity funds since 2013, according to an August 2020 Barclays report. But the SEC has largely steered away from specific directives to firms on ESG issues despite the growing investor interest, until recently.The recent moves underscore that the agency is “taking an ‘all of SEC approach’ to climate and ESG risks,” Satyam Khanna, SEC senior policy adviser for climate and ESG, told Reuters.",Reuters

678,"U.S. weekly jobless claims rise moderately as labor market stabilizes
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, likely boosted by brutal winter storms in the densely populated South in mid-February, though the labor market outlook is improving amid declining new COVID-19 cases.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-weekly-jobless-claims-rise-moderately-as-labor-market-stabilizes-idUSKBN2AW1PV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, likely boosted by brutal winter storms in the densely populated South in mid-February, though the labor market outlook is improving amid declining new COVID-19 cases.That was confirmed by other data on Thursday showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based companies plummeted 57% in February. The labor market has lagged an acceleration in overall economic activity, driven by nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic aid provided by the U.S. government in late December.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also struck an optimistic note on the labor market on Thursday, telling a Wall Street Journal forum that there is “good reason to expect job creation to pick up in the coming months.” Powell, however, said there is still a lot of ground to cover for the labor market to get back to a state of full employment.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 745,000 for the week ended Feb. 27, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 750,000 applications in the latest week.Unadjusted claims rose 31,519 to 748,078 last week, boosted by filings in Texas and New York, as well as in Ohio, which has been plagued by fraudulent applications.Stormy weather in the South left large parts of Texas without power or water for days. The deep freeze shut oil production and refineries in Texas, the biggest producer of natural gas and oil in the United States.Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.2 million people filed claims last week.But the sun is slowly starting to peek through the clouds shrouding the labor market. In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S. companies announced 34,531 job cuts in February. That was the smallest number since December 2019 and was down from 79,552 January.“The jobs picture is beginning to firm up again after a rough winter,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.A drop in daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations helped to lift consumer spending in January. Though the pace of decline in infections has stalled, economists believe the labor market will accelerate in the spring and through summer, noting that vaccinations were increasing daily.A boost to hiring is also expected from President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion recovery plan, which is under consideration by Congress.Still, the road to recovery remains long and difficult.Though weekly jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March 2020 when the pandemic hit the United States a little more than a year ago, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.In a well-functioning labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 124,000 to 4.295 million during the week ended Feb 20. But that was mainly due to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.About 4.465 million people were on the government-funded extended benefits program during the week ended Feb. 13. At least 18 million people were on unemployment benefits under all programs in mid-February.“This underscores just how far the nation is from a genuine labor market recovery,” said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation.Government-funded unemployment benefits will expire in mid-March if Congress does not pass the Biden administration’s relief package, affecting nearly 12 million people.Last week’s claims data has no bearing on February’s employment report as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed establishments and households. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government will likely report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 182,000 jobs in February after rising by only 49,000 in January.Hopes for a pick-up in hiring last month were supported by a survey last week showing consumers’ perceptions of the labor market improved in February after deteriorating in January and December. In addition, a measure of manufacturing employment increased to a two-year high in February.But those expectations were tempered by reports on Wednesday showing private employers hired fewer-than-expected workers in February. Employment growth in the services industry retreated last month, with businesses reporting they were “unable to fill vacant positions with qualified applicants.”The year-long COVID-19 pandemic is keeping some workers at home, fearful of accepting or returning to jobs that could expose them to the virus. Millions of women have left the labor force to look after children as many schools remain closed.The Fed’s “Beige Book” report on Wednesday noted “continued difficulties attracting and retaining qualified workers” reported by many of the U.S. central bank’s contacts last month, with labor shortages “most acute among low-skill occupations and skilled trade positions.” The Fed’s contacts cited the coronavirus, childcare, and unemployment benefits as factors behind the labor supply problem.",Reuters

A BaFin spokesman was not immediately able to comment.BaFin’s move was another blow to Bremen-based Greensill Bank’s owner, Greensill Capital, which said on Tuesday it is in talks to sell large parts of its business after the loss of backing from two Swiss asset managers which underpinned key parts of its supply chain financing model.Founded by Lex Greensill, a former Citigroup and Morgan Stanley banker and adviser to the British government, Greensill is the largest non-bank provider of supply chain finance.It says its technology-driven approach provided $143 billion of financing in 2019 across 10 million customers and suppliers.Greensill helps companies spread out the time they have to pay their bills. The loans, which typically have maturities of up to 90 days, are securitized and sold to investors, allowing Greensill to make new loans.BaFin said on Wednesday that an audit found that Greensill Bank could not provide evidence of receivables on its balance sheet purchased from mining tycoon Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance.GFG did not respond on Wednesday to a request for comment on BaFin’s findings.BaFin’s oversight of banks and financial markets in Europe’s largest economy has come under intense political and media scrutiny after it failed to act on allegations of accounting fraud at payments company Wirecard before its collapse.Its president Felix Hufeld is leaving as a result of BaFin’s handling of the Wirecard scandal.“Once again, BaFin appears to have reacted too late to tips,” said Danyal Bayaz, a member of the German parliament.BaFin said in a statement that it “acted decisively” in 2020 on Greensill Bank.The bank auditor review revealed a concentration of risk “but no indications of fraud or other criminal acts,” BaFin said.BaFin said that in the first half of last year it initiated a forensic audit, and took various enforcement actions including the installation of a special monitor.",Reuters

Even if it does nothing, it could become more attractive if the EU tightens curbs on off-exchange trading,” Puaar said.The announcement comes a day after a government-backed review recommended loosening listing rules to attract more company flotations to London.",Reuters

They instead issued vouchers to customers as hundreds of thousands of flights were grounded.European auditors began investigating on Wednesday to assess whether the European Commission, the EU executive, had protected the rights of air travellers or those who booked flights during the crisis.They will also assess whether EU states took passenger rights into account when granting emergency state aid to the travel and transport industry.“Our audit will check that the rights of millions of air travellers in the EU were not collateral damage in the fight to save struggling airlines,” said Annemie Turtelboom at the European Court of Auditors, who is leading the audit.However, industry body Airlines for Europe, which represents major air carriers, said on Thursday that current regulation should be changed. In April last year, 12 EU governments urged the Commission to suspend rules forcing cash-drained airlines to offer full refunds for cancelled flights instead of vouchers for future travel because of the pandemic.“It is also in everyone’s interest to make the regulation crisis-proof going forward. This ought to include deferred reimbursement of travellers when a crisis systematically disrupts air travel,” Airlines for Europe said in a statement.The Commission said on Monday it was investigating airline practices regarding flight cancellations and refunds, following questions by the European Bureau of Consumers’ Unions.“We expect airlines to properly inform consumers of their rights when a flight needs to be cancelled and to ensure that all passengers who want a refund can receive it,” EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said in a statement.",Reuters

The Biden administration on Wednesday said it would scrap a Trump-era proposal to weaken environmental protections for millions of acres of California desert to ease development of wind and solar energy projects.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-desert/biden-scraps-trump-plan-to-weaken-environmental-rules-to-build-renewables-in-california-idUSKBN2AH2SH,"(Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday said it would scrap a Trump-era proposal to weaken environmental protections for millions of acres of California desert to ease development of wind and solar energy projects.The move is President Joe Biden’s latest effort to roll back his predecessor’s four-year legacy of energy and environmental deregulation. Former President Donald Trump’s administration made a last-minute push to accelerate energy development on public lands, including by amending the so-called Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan just days before leaving office.In the coming days, Biden’s Department of Interior will revoke the public comment period on those plan amendments, a spokesman for the agency said in an emailed statement.Biden supports building more renewable energy installations on public lands, but his administration said the original DRECP balanced wind and solar development with conservation and outdoor recreation.“The Trump administration’s proposal in its final days to re-open the plan is unnecessary and at odds with balanced land management,” Laura Daniel Davis, Interior’s principal deputy secretary for land and minerals management, said in a statement.The DRECP was hatched jointly with the state of California during the presidency of Barack Obama and set aside areas for renewable energy development. Last month, Trump’s Interior said the changes were needed for California to meet its goal to phase out the use of fossil fuels.Some wind and solar developers opposed the Obama-era strategy because they said it left millions of acres off-limits to their projects.This month, the California Wind Energy Association sent a letter to Interior saying that the DRECP amendments proposed by the previous administration “may be consistent with the Administration’s climate policy goals and urge that it be considered.”An Interior official would not comment on the letter.",Reuters

Any federal reparations program could cost trillions of dollars, they estimate.Supporters say such payments would act as acknowledgement of the value of the forced, unpaid labor that supported the economy of Southern U.S. states until the Civil War ended slavery in 1865, the broken promise of land grants after the war and the burden of the century and a half of legal and de facto segregation that followed.",Reuters

Those losses are 8 times more than the roughly 3% decline in the benchmark S&P 500 over the same time. Despite that slide, the fund remains up 122% over the last 12 months.Wood shot to prominence over the last year with her outsized bets on companies such as Tesla and Square that surged during the pandemic, attracting $14.84 billion in inflows over the past 12 months, according to Lipper data. Over the last month, however, technology stocks have faltered as investors have priced in concerns about higher inflation as the pace of vaccinations increase and hopes that the broad economy will put the coronavirus pandemic behind it.Ark Invest did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of Tesla Inc, which account for roughly 10% of the ARK fund, are down 26% over the last month, while shares of Roku Inc are down 13%. Shares of Teldadoc Health Inc, another of the fund’s top holdings, are down slightly more than 25% over the same time.The rapid decline in performance could lead to large outflows from the fund as investors start to chase other managers that appear to have a hotter hand, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.“Investors that arrived in 2021 after seeing triple-digit returns in 2020 are likely to be disappointed and be less likely to stick around as short-term losses pile up,” he said.Investors pulled $465.3 million from the ARK Innovation fund on Feb 23, which was the fund’s largest outflow on record, according to Morningstar.",Reuters

On Feb. 25, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 3.5%, its biggest daily decline in four months. Both indexes churned in January but remain up year to date.Wood, who founded the firm in 2014, has become one of the faces of the U.S. stock market rally during the coronavirus pandemic. The ARK Innovation fund is up 136% over the last 12 months. The fund fell 6.1% on Wednesday and is up less than 1% for the year to date.Tesla Inc, which accounts for roughly 10% of the Ark Innovation fund’s portfolio, remains attractive given its lead in autonomous driving, she said. Shares of the company are up nearly 345% over the last 12 months despite dropping nearly 20% over the last four weeks.“Our conviction on its autonomous strategy has increased,” she said.At the same time, companies that rallied during the pandemic such as Zoom Video Communications Inc and television streaming platform Roku Inc remain attractive given their expected growth rates over the next five years, she said.Shares of Zoom are “probably undervalued”, while Roku and Amazon.com Inc “will take the lion’s share of the connected TV market,” Wood said.Along with technology stocks, Wood said she expects the price of bitcoin will keep rising as more U.S. companies diversify cash holdings and add the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets. Tesla Inc, for instance, said on Feb. 8 it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, while Square said on Feb. 23 it added another $170 million to its bitcoin position in the fourth quarter.Should other U.S. companies follow suit, the price of bitcoin could increase by between $40,000 and $400,000, Wood said.The cryptocurrency rose 7.5% to $51,030 in Wednesday afternoon trading.",Reuters

It also prompted Texas and Louisiana to declare emergencies and direct gas supplies to the states’ power generators.Australia’s Macquarie was one of the largest winners in the cold snap, benefiting from record U.S. natural gas prices. It could collect a $317 million profit from the weather-related gas binge, analysts said.Macquarie had rejected Exxon’s own declaration of a natural disaster, the lawsuit said, but the Australian company later issued its own force majeure declaration over gas it had agreed to provide Exxon in Texas.",Reuters

Albemarle Corp, the world's top lithium producer, has accused a Chilean regulator of ""unjust"" discrimination for refusing to make public a key report on the impact of mining on the Atacama salt flat, according to court filings.

A government watchdog upheld the decision.Both Albemarle and SQM - the only two lithium miners on the salt flat - contributed data to the report. But while SQM’s contract with the government allows it to review and comment on the study, Albemarle’s agreement does not.Albemarle blasted that discrepancy in previously unreported arguments made before a Santiago appeals court in February, saying it resulted in “arbitrary, unjust, illegal, and above all, unconstitutional discrimination.” The company is appealing the watchdog’s decision and demanding the report be made public immediately.The spat underscores rising tensions between Albemarle and regulators in the Andean nation over operations in the high-altitude Atacama flat, home to one-quarter of the world’s current supply of lithium.Albemarle has for months also feuded with Corfo over royalty payments, and with another Chilean regulator over data used to determine its production quota.The Atacama report and the true state of the flat’s environmental health has long been an obsession of lithium industry watchers because of the area’s huge importance in satisfying soaring global demand for the white metal, a vital component in the batteries that power electric vehicles.Corfo told Reuters in a written statement that it had sent a final draft of the environmental study - meant to guide government regulation and oversight of the flat - to SQM for review on Feb. 16.Corfo’s contract with SQM requires it offer the company the opportunity to comment, but the agency is not required to implement the company’s suggested changes.The regulator said it would make the final draft public following SQM’s review “provided that any eventual affected third parties did not oppose its release.”SQM did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the case. The Chilean miner has previously argued in filings that releasing the study would put it at a competitive disadvantage, and says it has adhered to the terms of its contract with Corfo.Albemarle told Reuters in a statement that it wants the study made public immediately.“This report... should be a contribution towards ensuring the sustainability of the Salar de Atacama,” the company said.Lawmakers, academics, environmentalists, local communities, German carmaker Volkswagen and Chilean courts have all emphasized the importance of an environmental study to help dispel lingering questions on the impact of lithium mining in Chile.",Reuters

We can’t sacrifice affordability and reliability.”Fowke said wind power can play a very big role in the energy mix, noting “this year wind will be largest source of power on our grid and it’s the cheapest form of energy we have on our system.”Xcel has a goal to reduce carbon emissions by 80% compared with 2005 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.“To get to 80% is not an easy thing,” Fowke said, noting the company will continue to move away from coal, preserve its existing nuclear fleet and have about 65%-70% of energy from renewables by 2030.To reach the last 20%, however, Fowke said “I want to get to 100% carbon free and I think 2050 is the right timeframe, we need new technologies” like next-generation nuclear, more battery storage and carbon capture and storage.Duke CEO Lynn Good said on the same CERAWeek panel that “We share a common goal of reducing carbon emissions but we need to do it in a reliable way.”“Natural gas plays an import role in balancing the system,” Good said, noting “gas will continue playing a role into the future.”She said 50% of generation in the Carolinas comes from carbon-free sources like nuclear and solar. North Carolina was third in the nation with installed solar.Like Xcel, Duke is striving to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Separately, Good said Duke sees opportunities to reduce its real estate costs as more people work from home during the coronavirus pandemic.",Reuters

Trafigura would have a 19% stake, less than the 25% planned in the initial sale deal with Vale.The parties also called for reinforced environmental standards and set a target for the mining complex to be carbon neutral by 2040.Vale and Trafigura welcomed the political agreement.“Our task now is to complete any and all outstanding items to allow the transaction to formally conclude,” Vale said in an emailed statement.The company, which has tried to sell the New Caledonian assets for years, has said around 3,000 direct and indirect jobs depend on the restart of its mining complex.“We’re looking forward to operations resuming and for final completion of the transaction as soon as possible,” a Trafigura spokesperson said.Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The electric vehicle maker would act as an industrial partner to help with product and sustainability standards as well as taking some supply for its battery production, according to the political agreement.Demand for nickel, mainly used in making stainless steel, is expected to be boosted by demand for electric vehicle batteries.New Caledonia is the world’s fourth-largest nickel producer.

But Japan’s No.2 automaker is stepping up its game in self-driving technology as global competitors aim for fully autonomous vehicles.There are different levels of automation, from levels 0 to 5, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers and most automakers. hereLevel 3, also known as conditional driving automation, involves automated features which allow drivers to engage in activities behind the wheel, such as watching movies or using smartphones - but under limited conditions - while their car navigates expressway traffic.Besides Honda, several automakers including Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz have said they are ready to deploy Level 3 systems for highway driving.Levels 0 to 2 involve driver support features such as automated braking systems and lane departure warnings that need to be supervised by a driver. Liability for vehicle behaviour rests with the car owner rather than the manufacturer.Most global automakers that develop autonomous driving technology such as General Motors Co , Volvo and Toyota Motor Corp, currently offer vehicles equipped with a level 2 automation system. This means vehicles can accelerate, brake and steer without driver input, but drivers are required to remain engaged at all times.A level 5 vehicle, on the other hand, is fully autonomous and can navigate roads without any human attention in all conditions.Honda’s level 3 “Traffic Jam Pilot” system uses data from 3D high-definition maps and a global navigation satellite system for vehicle control, as well as a dozen of external sensors to detect the car’s surroundings.The system can alert the driver to respond when handing over the control, for example via vibration on the driver’s seatbelt.And if the driver is unresponsive, the system will assist with an emergency stop by decelerating and stopping the vehicle while alerting surrounding cars with hazard lights and the horn.Honda simulated around 10 million patterns of possible real-world situations, and conducted a massive number of demonstration tests on highways to create safe-driving technology, said Hitoshi Aoki, the Legend’s development manager.($1 = 107.3300 yen)",Reuters

Ossoff and Warnock won in a political earthquake that resulted in Democrats seizing control of the Senate from the Republicans, who had held the chamber since 2015.Their unexpected twin victories came after President Joe Biden narrowly carried Georgia, a seismic change in a state that also elected hard-right Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had espoused the QAnon conspiracy theory.“Georgia is not a blue state,” Perdue wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. “It is imperative that Republicans regain the majority in the U.S. Senate in 2022.”The victories by Biden, Ossoff and Warnock followed a near-win of Georgia’s governorship by voting rights activist and former state legislator Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost to Republican Brian Kemp in 2018.The near victory gave Abrams a national profile. She has not yet said if she will run for governor again in 2022, but Kemp allies have launched a “Stop Stacey” group in anticipation.While Ossoff was elected to a full six-year term, Warnock was elected to serve the remainder of former Republican Senator Johnny Isakson’s term and will need to face the voters for another election in 2022.",Reuters

Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it would spend more than $30 million to offset 13 million metric tons of carbon emissions over 10 months last year as part of its pledge to help combat climate change.

Replacement planes will be 25% more fuel-efficient, the U.S. airline said.In February 2020, Delta announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next decade in initiatives like offsets, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon sequestration that would limit the impact of global air travel on the environment, the first airline to make a commitment of that scale.That followed moves in Europe by easyJet to offset emissions on all its flights and by British Airways and Air France to do the same on their domestic flights.Delta has agreed to purchase a future supply of 70 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel per year.The amount the U.S. carrier plans to pay for offsets from March 1 to Dec. 31 would equate to less than 0.35% of its revenue during the period, based on Reuters calculations using Delta’s financial results from April 1 to Dec. 31.Delta said the carbon tonnage offset was equal to the carbon sequestered by 17 million acres of U.S. forests in one year, enough to cover the state of West Virginia.The Biden administration is pressuring U.S. airlines to do more to reduce emissions.The chief executives of major U.S. carriers met with White House officials last week to discuss tackling aviation pollution and urge U.S. support for greener aviation fuel.United Airlines has committed to a multimillion-dollar investment in carbon capture, a technology designed to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as part of a plan to be 100% green by 2050.Delta said it also believed carbon capture had significant potential.Delta owns its own oil refinery, making it unique among its peers. The company posted a $102 million refining segment loss in the fourth quarter and a $441 million loss on third party fuel sales.The refinery, located in Trainer, Pennsylvania, emitted about 1.45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent gas in 2019, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.That year, the net quantity of greenhouse gasses of the petroleum products the refinery produced totaled roughly 26 million metric tons, according to the EPA.",Reuters

German business groups expressed dismay on Thursday after Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed a gradual easing of coronavirus curbs but added an ""emergency brake"" to reimpose restrictions if case numbers get out of control.

Some economists also worried about long-term damage to the economy and people’s opportunities in life.“The results of the coronavirus summit are a disaster for the retail sector,” said Stefan Genth, chief executive of the HDE retail association.Under a five-stage plan, up to five people from two households will be allowed to meet from March 8, with children under 14 exempt. Some shops, including book stores and garden centres, can reopen.Other retailers can only reopen in regions where case numbers are below 50 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. If the incidence rises above 50, ‘click and meet’ restrictions kick in, whereby customers book a slot to go to the store.On Thursday, Germany’s seven-day case average rose to 64.7 from 64 on Wednesday. New infections increased by 11,912 to 2,471,942 and the death toll rose by 359 to 71,240.“The stable incidence of 50 prescribed for opening shops is not in sight,” the HDE said, adding that retailers were likely to lose another 10 billion euros ($12.1 billion) in sales by the end of March compared to 2019.Commerzbank economist Joerg Kraemer and Holger Schmieding at Berenberg Bank both expect gross domestic product (GDP) to fall by 1.8% on the quarter in the January to March period.Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo economic institute, worried about school closures. These could have “massive, measurable effects on lifetime incomes”, he said, calling for catch-up classes over the summer holidays.The powerful BDI industry association urged the government to speed up efforts to expand vaccinations and rapid testing.The HDE was sceptical about the possibility of shopping by appointment, noting that personnel and operating costs would probably be higher than the turnover.Hans Peter Wollseifer, president of the association representing skilled trades, also called for faster progress on vaccination and mass testing for COVID-19.“In order to prevent the death of businesses on a broad front, economic life must be made possible again as quickly as possible,” Wollseifer said. “The decisions taken now do not do justice to this.”He called for other criteria to be taken more into account instead of just focusing on the level of infections, such as the situation in intensive care units in hospitals as well as progress in testing and vaccination.($1 = 0.8295 euros)",Reuters
705,"UK's historic business tax hike will face push-back, think tanks say
British finance minister Rishi Sunak will have to fight to implement the sharp rise in corporation tax that is a key plank of his plans to tackle the coronavirus hit to the public finances, leading think tanks said on Thursday.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-budget/uks-historic-business-tax-hike-will-face-push-back-think-tanks-say-idUSKBN2AW124,"LONDON (Reuters) - British finance minister Rishi Sunak will have to fight to implement the sharp rise in corporation tax that is a key plank of his plans to tackle the coronavirus hit to the public finances, leading think tanks said on Thursday.Britain’s borrowing is due to reach a post-World War Two high of 17% of economic output in the financial year which ends this month, equivalent to 355 billion pounds.The deficit should drop back down to 3% of gross domestic product by the mid-2020s, according to forecasts underpinning the budget plan that Sunak announced on Wednesday.Central to the plan is a hike in corporation tax to 25% in 2023 from 19% now to raise an extra 17 billion pounds, the first rise in the tax since 1974.But policy analysts said Sunak would face heavy lobbying to backtrack from within his Conservative Party and from businesses during the two years before the tax rise will take effect.“I will be amazed if in two years the CBI (Confederation of British Industry) is not saying it is absolutely bonkers that we are raising corporation tax to 25%, whereas 23% I think maybe they would have got away with,” Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said.The CBI has warned that the corporation tax rise would hit investment. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, another think tank, said that would mean the tax would probably raise less than hoped.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not always heeded the concerns of business groups. He largely ignored their worries in Brexit talks which resulted in a limited trade agreement with the European Union.As a sweetener, Sunak has offered businesses a generous, two-year rebate on corporation tax to companies which invest more, hoping to speed up recovery from the COVID pandemic which cost Britain 10% of GDP last year.The estimated 24 billion-pound cost of the rebate could prove higher as the IFS warned it was open to abuse if businesses stretched the definition of eligible investment.The other main tax revenue generator is a freeze on income tax thresholds to raise 8 billion pounds a year by 2025.Sunak also faces a challenge to deliver his target of 17 billion pounds of annual spending cuts by the middle of the decade at a time when demands for spending on health and other services are likely to rise.IFS director Paul Johnson said if Sunak managed to implement his plan, he would meet one definition of a balanced budget - borrowing only to invest - by 2025-26, but at a huge cost.“The sad truth is that that would be a balance built on the highest sustained tax burden in UK history and yet further cuts in unprotected public service spending,” Johnson said.Another risk for Sunak comes from Britain’s vulnerability to any jump in borrowing costs.On its own, a 1 percentage point rise in short and long-term interest rates would cost the government an extra 21 billion pounds a year, Britain’s budget forecasters have estimated.Normally, bond yields would rise if growth was improving, meaning more tax revenues to offset the higher interest bill.“The risk that should be keeping Mr Sunak awake at night is that interest rates go up but he doesn’t get the associated rise in revenues,” IFS Deputy Director Carl Emmerson said.",Reuters

Revenue fell 71% to 2.59 billion euros.Its shares were down 2.3% at 12.49 euros as of 1230 GMT in Frankfurt, after gaining nearly 15% since the start of the year on recovery hopes.Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said that despite “tangible progress” on cost-cutting at its airline subsidiaries, “Lufthansa mainline is still stuck at step one” with short-term crisis union agreements.“More needs to happen - and faster,” Roeska said.Lufthansa cut its global workforce by 20% to 110,000 in 2020 and is seeking to eliminate another 10,000 German jobs or equivalent wage costs.The group, which received a government-backed 9 billion euro bailout last June, said it will operate at 40-50% of pre-crisis capacity this year, lowering its earlier 40-60% ambition.Summer travel will nonetheless pick up swiftly whenever restrictions are eased, Spohr said, and Lufthansa stands ready to restore 70% of its schedule “in the short term”.The group’s full-year net loss of 6.73 billion euros was on 13.59 billion euros in revenue, down 63%. The company predicted a narrower 2021 EBIT loss than last year’s 5.45 billion euros.Analysts had expected losses of 6.63 billion euros for 2020 and 1.24 billion euros for the last three months, according to Lufthansa’s consensus polling.The airline group has outlined plans to cut its fleet to 650 planes in 2023 and phase out ageing Boeing 747-400s and Airbus 340-600s. A slower recovery means more grounded planes may never return to service before retirement.Operating cash burn was reduced to 300 million euros per month in the fourth quarter and is expected to remain stable at that level in the first three months of 2021, the company said.Like many airline peers, Lufthansa posted record 2020 cargo profits as mass aircraft groundings squeezed capacity and sent freight prices soaring. Divisional adjusted EBIT jumped to 772 million euros from 1 million, dwarfed by passenger losses.Net debt increased to 9.9 billion euros as of Dec. 31 from 6.7 billion a year earlier, while total liquidity stood at 10.6 billion euros including 5.7 billion euros in unused aid.“We have sufficient liquidity to withstand a market environment that remains difficult,” Chief Financial Officer Remco Steenbergen said.($1 = 0.8305 euros)",Reuters

A spokeswoman for the IFT also declined to comment.While the ruling does not change the status quo for America Movil, it is a setback for the giant’s ongoing battle to shake off the restrictions imposed by the reform, industry experts said.“It’s a significant defeat for America Movil and Carlos Slim ... all the restrictions stay in place,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.It could also pave the way for the IFT to impose more restrictions aimed at trimming back its power and making it easier for rivals to enter the market.“It might free up the IFT to be more forceful in insisting that America Movil act to reduce its market share below 50% by further sharing infrastructure or making other concessions to rivals,” said Andrew Paxman, a business historian at Mexico’s Economic Research and Teaching Center (CIDE).",Reuters

The tally fell short of the two-thirds needed to secure conviction.North Carolina Republican Chairman Michael Whatley condemned Burr for voting against the former president, as a “shocking and disappointing” abdication of his duty to voters.Burr, who said last week there was “compelling” evidence that President Trump was guilty of inciting an insurrection, said after the committee vote that it was a “sad day” for North Carolina Republicans.“My party’s leadership has chosen loyalty to one man over the core principles of the Republican Party and the founders of our great nation,” he said.Louisiana’s Republican Party voted on Saturday to censure Senator Bill Cassidy for voting to convict Trump. The party’s leader in Pennsylvania, Lawrence Tabas, has publicly criticized Senator Pat Toomey for voting to convict.The other four Republicans who voted to convict were Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse.The Republican Party faces internal conflict since Trump left office on Jan. 20, with many officials remaining publicly loyal to Trump and his devoted base of voters, while others including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have publicly criticized the former president.McConnell said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Monday there was no question Trump “bears moral responsibility.

Biden will deliver remarks at a virtual gathering of the Munich security forum here on Feb. 19.After years of Trump’s public ridiculing of NATO allies such as Germany who failed to reach defense spending targets, Biden’s Pentagon will, without abandoning those targets, focus on progress made toward bolstering NATO’s collective defense, officials said.“Trust is something that can’t be built overnight, is something that takes time. It takes more than words. It takes action,” said a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s objectives for the NATO meeting.To underscore Biden's views on NATO, the White House even took the rare step of releasing a video youtu.be/o9E1S3UPRFY on Jan. 27 of the U.S. president's first conversation with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in which he used the word ""sacred"" to describe the U.S. commitment to collective defense.Still, Biden could face an uphill battle in Europe, which saw Washington upend its commitments under Trump, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.Trump’s portrayal of NATO as an organization in crisis, dragged down by laggard members, has left many European allies feeling worn down.“There’s an exhaustion in European security circles from Trump and his unpredictability,” said a European NATO diplomat.“We’ve just spent four years not talking to each other and the world is very different from four years ago. Biden needs to do a big repair job in Europe.”Portugal’s Defence Minister Joao Gomes Cravinho, underscoring wariness about the United States, told the European Parliament on Jan. 28 that the Trump years were an “ideological experiment” that had “devastating effects in terms of the credibility of the United States and its strength internationally.”The deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in which pro-Trump followers tried to keep him in power, has also done severe damage to America’s global image as a beacon of democracy, political analysts said.One of Biden’s biggest challenges will be convincing allies there won’t be a return to another Trump era, or something akin to it, perhaps four or eight years down the line.“That’s a legitimate fear and a legitimate concern,” said Rachel Rizzo, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security focusing on European security and NATO.She added it will be a “slow process” to prove the United States can be a reliable ally.French President Emmanuel Macron has gone so far as to say Europe needs its own sovereign defense strategy, independent of the United States here. Still, eastern European allies such as Poland – fearful of Russia - say European defense plans should only complement NATO, not replace it.The NATO defense ministerial is expected to broach a range of issues, including efforts to end the two-decade-old war in Afghanistan.The ministerial is also expected to include discussion of the so-called “2 percent target” which requires NATO members spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024.Germany, Italy and Spain will all miss the 2024 target, according to initial projections released by NATO in October. Germany has pledged to reach the NATO spending target by 2031, and its failure angered Trump, who ordered a pullout of some 12,000 troops from Germany, declaring: “We don’t want to be the suckers any more.”Asked about the target, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said he expected Austin to emphasize that many allies were meeting the target and others were “striving to get there.”“I think you’ll see a supportive message from the secretary about how relevant NATO is,” said Kirby, a retired Navy admiral.Another U.S. official said that even with economic stress on budgets because of COVID-19, the expectation was still for allies to hit 2 percent of their GDP, with Washington likely to make the argument that the health crisis should not be allowed to turn into a security crisis.“But you’ll hear a substantially different tone and a lot more emphasis on different capabilities,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.“It won’t be instrumentalized as a political weapon to beat up allies.”",Reuters

The White House is adding transportation and manufacturing specialists to its senior ranks as President Joe Biden prepares to lobby for a U.S. infrastructure bill that was a centerpiece of his campaign.

Biden vowed to field a historically diverse team and has faced pressure from within his own ranks to live up to that promise in his administration’s early days.The new additions also come as the White House has been laying the groundwork for its second major spending bill, which it plans to unveil if it can shepherd Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill through congress this month. The Senate could vote on the bill as soon as this week.Meanwhile, on consumer protection issues, Biden has regularly turned to personnel like English whose views are aligned with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has advocated strict enforcement of the financial industry through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republican lawmakers largely regard the agency as too powerful and unaccountable.As a presidential candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion building climate-resilient homes, wiring cities for broadband internet, encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing electric vehicle charging stations, among other projects.He said the spending, paid for with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, would create millions of jobs for an economy reeling from the novel coronavirus pandemic while also shoring up the country’s resilience to climate change.Reynolds has studied topics including growing the domestic manufacturing base. Silverberg led the development of an $8 billion transit upgrade program at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.Biden and his transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, are expected to meet on Thursday afternoon with a bipartisan group of House of Representatives legislators on infrastructure.The White House has not specified how closely its legislative proposal will hew to the “Build Back Better” agenda Biden proposed as a candidate. Key decisions about the plan’s final cost and contents have not been finalized by his team, according to several people familiar with the plans.Infrastructure spending has backing in both parties. But Biden’s tax and spending plans have also drawn bipartisan push back. Former President Donald Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a major infrastructure bill during his term, which ended in January.",Reuters

It did not elaborate.Foxconn said it saw revenue for cloud products that include servers and revenue for computing products such as laptops to rise about 10% in the first quarter, respectively.Foxconn’s chairman said last month that he expects his company and its clients will face only “limited impact” from a chip shortage that has rattled the global automotive and semiconductor industries.Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has previously said it expects revenue to grow about 10% in 2021.Over the past year or so it has announced several deals on the production of electric vehicles with automakers including U.S. electric-car maker Fisker Inc, China’s Byton and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group and Stellantis NV’s Fiat Chrysler unit.Shares in Foxconn have risen more than 20% so far this year.Tech-powerhouse Taiwan’s economy is booming due to the pandemic because of global demand for tablets, computers and smartphones.Taiwan’s January export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, surged 49.3% from a year earlier to $52.72 billion.Taiwan’s government last month revised up its outlook for 2021, predicting the economy will grow at its fastest pace in seven years, seeing gross domestic product (GDP) expanding 4.64% on the jump in exports driven by tech demand.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) the world’s largest contract chip maker, in January posted its best-ever quarterly profit and lifted revenue and capital spending estimates to record levels as it forecast “multiple years of growth opportunities”.",Reuters

It has been closely watched as it has set a precedent in how car and battery makers split the bill when problems arise.Hyundai said on Thursday it was revising down fourth-quarter operating profit by 300 billion won ($265 million) or nearly a fifth to 1.3 trillion won, while LG Chem slashed its operating profit by more than 80% to 119 billion won.The latest recall for the Kona EV follows a recall late last year for a software upgrade after a spate of fires. One of the recalled Kona EVs caught fire in January, however, and South Korean authorities launched a probe into whether the first recall had been adequate.The new recall applies to nearly 76,000 Kona EVs built between 2018 and 2020, including about 25,000 sold in South Korea.

We value opinions and feedback from all of our stakeholders and are open to constructive engagement on this matter,” it added.The Norwegian sovereign fund, formally called the Government Pension Fund Global and set up in 1996 to save petroleum revenues for future generations, owns about 1.5% of all globally listed shares.Holding stakes in around 9,100 companies worldwide, it has set the pace on a host of issues in the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) field, and its decisions are often followed by other investors.The bank separately said it would allow the wealth fund to invest again in Poland’s Atal, which had been excluded since 2017 for risk of human rights violations through its use of North Korean workers at Polish construction sites.“As a result of a resolution in the United Nations Security Council, all North Korean workers have now been sent out of Poland.

We therefore have a good foundation for active ownership on the issues to which this matter relates,” the central bank said.The fund held a 1.3% stake in the German firm at the end of 2020 valued at $147.1 million.Thyssenkrupp in a statement said there was no specific reason triggering the talks.“Thyssenkrupp is in regular and constructive dialogue with its investors.

The board would begin an immediate search for a new CEO.Magness worked at ERCOT for more than a decade and became its CEO and president in 2016 after working as its general counsel, the Texas Tribune newspaper reported.Brad Jones, former head of New York’s power grid, is the leading candidate to replace Magness as ERCOT’s CEO, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the board’s thinking.Magness was grilled for hours last week for leaving power prices at up to 450 times the usual rate after the threat to the state’s grid had ended.Seven of ERCOT’s 15 directors have resigned in the last week and the head of the state’s Public Utility Commission, which supervised ERCOT, resigned on Monday.The winter storm caused widespread blackouts across Texas, a state unaccustomed to extreme cold, knocking out power to more than 4 million people at its peak.",Reuters

Short interest is at 2.69% of its share capital and 4.2 days of average daily trading volume.“The company might find it difficult to attract new investors to the Hong Kong offer unless they offer HK shares at a significant discount to the market price due to bad press coverage,” said LightStream Research analyst Oshadhi Kumarasiri, who publishes on Smartkarma platform.“But at the end of the day, if it’s offered at a substantial discount to the market price, it won’t be that hard to find subscribers.”Top Glove was in talks with Citi, UBS and China International Capital Corp (CICC) to manage the listing, Reuters reported in October.Citi and UBS opted not to sponsor the deal late last year due to heightened concerns about Top Glove’s rubber farming processes and the reputational risk of working with a U.S. sanctioned company, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.U.S. Customs in July sanctioned imports from some Top Glove subsidiaries, whose sales make up 12.5% of the firm’s sales, after finding evidence of forced labour practices.UBS and Top Glove could also not agree on fees, another person said.Citi and UBS declined comment. CICC did not respond to a request for comment.Top Glove - which will join a small list of companies with three listings, after its primary in Kuala Lumpur and secondary in Singapore - in an email to Reuters said decisions between the banks and the company were made on commercial basis.“We have cooperated with the (U.S. Customs) in its ongoing investigation and have taken extensive rectification actions to improve our labour practices and enhance our internal control measures,” it also said in the email.Top Glove plans to complete the Hong Kong listing process by the second quarter of this year as it seeks to expand its investor base to Hong Kong and mainland Chinese shareholders.Its draft prospectus showed CICC as sole sponsor, though firms typically appoint more banks closer to launch. The U.S. sanction, however, makes it unlikely international investment banks will work on the Top Glove deal, the people said.Earnings are still way above pre-pandemic levels but markets are already pricing in lower growth. Analysts have cut estimates for Top Glove’s net income by 7.3% on average over the past 30 days for the year ending August, and trimmed revenue by 5%, Refinitiv data showed.“It’s better to go for a listing now than later because there’ll likely be more uncertainties going forward, such as possibly lower average selling prices for gloves,” said a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst tracking the company.“No one is sure how fast or how much prices can come down yet, so if Top Glove is able to chalk up good profit and sales now, it’s a good time to do it now.”",Reuters
725,"Biden to bring in asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under Trump program
The U.S. government next week will begin to gradually process thousands of asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under a controversial program put in place by former President Donald Trump, officials said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-immigration-asylum/biden-to-bring-in-asylum-seekers-forced-to-wait-in-mexico-under-trump-program-idUSKBN2AC113,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government next week will begin to gradually process thousands of asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under a controversial program put in place by former President Donald Trump, officials said.The moves are part of a plan by the administration of President Joe Biden to end the program, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), an effort complicated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and concerns over illegal immigration.The Trump administration launched the program in 2019 as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on the ability to seek asylum in the United States, which Trump officials depicted as rife with fraud and meritless claims.The initiative forced more than 65,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers back across the border to wait for their U.S. court hearings, although far fewer are believed to still be waiting in Mexico.The Biden administration will begin by working to process about 25,000 migrants with active claims in the program, officials said on Thursday. The new guidelines will require migrants to register online or via phone, be tested for the coronavirus in Mexico and then come to a U.S. port of entry on a specific day.The news was welcomed with relief in a sprawling migrant camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, just across the border from Brownsville, Texas.“I’ve been reading all the articles,” said Salvadoran asylum seeker Sandra Andrade, who has been waiting in Mexico for over a year to resolve her U.S. court case. “Honestly, I have no words for how I’m feeling right now!”Biden vowed on the campaign trail to roll back restrictive Trump-era immigration policies, including MPP, which is informally known as “remain in Mexico.” His administration suspended new entries into the program when he took office on Jan. 20, but did not immediately put forward a plan to bring the people enrolled in it into the United States. Some have been waiting for as long as two years.Republicans embracing Trump’s hardline immigration views have criticized the ending of MPP and could use it as fuel for political attacks if illegal border crossings increase on Biden’s watch.Top Biden officials have stressed in recent weeks that migrants should not attempt to enter the United States, saying they need time to build up the capacity to process more asylum seekers.“Individuals who are not eligible under this initial phase should wait for further instructions and not travel to the border,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement accompanying the MPP announcement. “Due to the current pandemic, restrictions at the border remain in place and will be enforced.”Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador echoed that message on Friday, saying migrants should not think “the gates of the northern border are open” or believe human smugglers who say as much.During a call with reporters on Thursday evening, three Biden administration officials described the plans to process MPP enrollees, with the first phase beginning on Feb. 19.The officials, all of whom requested anonymity, only outlined procedures for people with active cases in U.S. immigration courts. Those with non-active cases, many of whom may have returned to their home countries, “will have other opportunities,” one of the officials said.Under the plan, migrants will need to register with international organizations over the internet or by phone and await instructions. One of the organizations will also handle coronavirus testing in Mexico, another official said.Biden officials declined to identify the organizations on Thursday. However, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said the refugee agency would work with both the U.S. and Mexican governments to ensure migrants in the program could safely enter the United States.The migrants’ claims will initially be heard at three ports of entry along the border, with organizations working to identify those in line the longest and those deemed particularly vulnerable.At two of the ports, the Biden administration expects to process 300 people per day at each port. The effort will expand to additional ports over time.“We will start small,” said one of the officials.The Biden officials declined to name the ports where the administration planned to begin processing, citing concerns that people would rush to those locations.Migrants entering the United States through the program will not be placed in detention centers, but could be subject to an alternative form of monitoring, including ankle bracelets.The United States developed the strategy in close coordination with Mexican authorities, the official said.Even while Biden moves to end one Trump program, he faces growing pressure from advocates to end another known as Title 42.

726,Virginia man with ties to anti-government 'Oath Keepers' pleads not guilty in Capitol riots case,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-capitol-riots/virginia-man-with-ties-to-anti-government-oath-keepers-pleads-not-guilty-in-capitol-riots-case-idUSKBN2AC2N5,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Virginia man whom prosecutors accuse of plotting for months in advance with fellow associates of the anti-government “Oath Keepers” militia to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday.Thomas Caldwell, a retired U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander who has held a security clearance and once worked for the FBI, was indicted last month along with Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl on charges of conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding, destroying government property and entering a restricted building.A federal judge on Friday also denied a renewed bid by Caldwell to be released from jail pending trial, after prosecutors said he had tried to destroy evidence against him, and argued he poses a danger to the community.“The nature and circumstances of the offenses could not be more serious,” U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C. said. The evidence suggests that Caldwell “engaged in planning and communications with others ... to plan a potential military-like incursion on the Capitol,” Mehta said.Followers of then president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol to disrupt the certification by lawmakers of Joe Biden’s election victory after months of Trump making unsubstantiated claims the vote was fraudulent. The riots led to five deaths, including a police officer. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on a charge of inciting an insurrection and is being tried in the Senate.In court on Friday, Caldwell grew agitated as Mehta discussed his ruling and read aloud snippets of texts and other evidence prosecutors had gathered against him, and interrupted the proceeding to object that things were taken out of context.“Anything you say on this record could be used against you,” Mehta reminded him.In court filings this week, prosecutors said the FBI had found a document entitled “Death List” during a search of Caldwell’s home with the hand-written name of an election official in another state.Prosecutors declined to identify the name of the election official in open court on Friday, except to say the official had received some publicity because of the 2020 presidential election and is not from Caldwell’s home state of Virginia.The Justice Department has said it has evidence of extensive planning by Caldwell, Watkins and Crowl ahead of the Jan. 6 riots, including a plot to stage an armed “quick reaction force” outside of Washington that would be ready to swoop in and fight “hand to hand” if ordered by Trump.The judge also said he found it “astonishing” that Caldwell allegedly exchanged messages with an associate of another militia group called the “Three Percenters” to discuss the idea of transporting weapons across the Potomac River.Caldwell’s attorney denied his client is a member of the Oath Keepers or that he ever actually entered the U.S. Capitol building itself, citing physical ailments that would have prevented him from doing so.Prosecutors on Friday acknowledged they don’t have evidence Caldwell is a “dues-paying” member, but said he nevertheless has strong ties to the group.",Reuters

He is the first to acknowledge this is not the standard of behavior set out by the President.”Ducklo, McCammond and Palmeri did not respond to emails seeking comment. An Axios spokeswoman said McCammond disclosed the relationship to her editors in November and was reassigned from a beat covering the White House.The suspension comes after Democratic President Joe Biden, who took office last month, vowed to take a hard line on any incivility among members of his administration.“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot ... no ifs, ands or buts,” Biden told political appointees during a virtual swearing-in ceremony. “Everybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity.”Psaki told reporters during a briefing on Friday that Biden was not involved in the decision to suspend Ducklo and stressed that the White House took the matter seriously.Ducklo’s behavior was “completely unacceptable. He knows that,” Psaki said. “We’ve had conversations with him. ... This will never happen again.”",Reuters

Even as the pandemic recedes thanks to vaccination, insurers see more health business coming their way, not least because public hospitals will have a huge backlog of treatments and operations that were postponed because of the pandemic.“There is nothing to suggest that the current growth situation won’t continue, at least in the coming years,” ASF said.",Reuters

Singapore has close ties with Myanmar and is one of its biggest investors.In the circular, the MAS urged financial institutions to keep timely tabs on the fast developing situation in Myanmar, including unilateral sanctions imposed by other jurisdictions.It said the situation in Myanmar could give rise to money laundering, terrorism financing and other financial crimes.“Given the developments in Myanmar, FIs are reminded to take appropriate measures to manage any risks arising from their business activities and customer relationships, including reputational, legal and operational risks,” the MAS said.The MAS said that financial institutions should file any suspicious transaction reports and inform it promptly, adding that such reports should be labelled “Myanmar 2021”.In response to a Reuters query, the MAS confirmed that it had issued a circular on Feb 25 relating to the developments in Myanmar.The circular was issued two days after the central bank said in a media release that its regular surveillance of the banking system had not found significant funds from Myanmar companies and individuals in banks in Singapore.Singapore police uses suspicious transaction reports and other financial information and analyses them to detect money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crimes, according to an advisory on its website.",Reuters

Texas' power grid operator on Wednesday cited 12 energy companies and two municipal utilities for failure to pay their bills for power and services during February's deadly blackout that has led to the ouster of the operator's chief executive.

High prices for emergency fuel and power saddled the companies that sell, transmit and generate electricity in the state with about $47 billion in costs, an official estimated.Texas consumers will see higher prices as the storm-related charges and unpaid fees are passed along to remaining providers.An ERCOT spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Magness is still listed as CEO on the ERCOT website. He took on the role in 2016.ERCOT officials are scheduled to go before a Texas senate committee on Thursday that is delving into the grid failure and resulting financial crisis facing the state’s power industry.As part of its duties, ERCOT acts as a clearinghouse, collecting for power and paying the companies that provide the electrons. Defaulting companies can have their customers taken and their outstanding debts are reallocated to all grid users.The largest of ERCOT’s 14 debtors, Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc, filed for bankruptcy on Monday listing $1.8 billion owed to ERCOT. A Brazos spokesman did not reply to requests for comment.The second-largest ERCOT debtor, Entrust Energy Inc, on Wednesday became the second electric provider cut from the grid in five days. It owed nearly $234,000. Entrust did not reply to a request for comment after normal business hours.The first company dropped from the grid, Griddy Energy LLC, had its customers moved to other providers after failing to pay an undisclosed amount.Vinnie Campo, the general manager of renewable power marketer Bulb US, said this week that he supports a proposal before the state’s Public Utility Commission to roll back some $2 billion in service fees.Bulb was cited on Tuesday as being $30,800 short on grid payments. However, a company spokeswoman said that amount was paid. Wednesday’s list of debtors showed Bulb was $5.1 million in arrears on its ERCOT bills.“Our primary focus through the storm and going forward is protecting customers from price increases and bill shock,” said Campo. “The market is in need of fixing and fast,” he said, criticizing storm price increases as a “windfall” for generators.ERCOT’s disclosure of those firms behind on their bills “is perfectly fair game,” said Patrick Woodson, chief executive of retail power marketer ATG Clean Energy, whose company is not on the list.“I hope they will apply the same standards to identifying the market participants who made massive profits during this disaster,” he said.",Reuters

They further argued that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland had also waded into the debate, proving politicization of Meng’s case.Meng, 49, was arrested on a U.S. warrant for bank fraud at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 and has since been living under house arrest while fighting extradition. She faces charges of bank fraud in the United States over misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to violate U.S. sanctions. She has said she is innocent.Ten days after Meng's arrest, then-President Trump told Reuters in an interview that he would intervene in the case if it would help get a better trade deal with China. here“With that utterance Ms. Meng became a bargaining chip in this economic contest between these two superpowers,” defence lawyer Richard Peck said. “Our contention is that his words amount to an abuse of process.”Canadian prosecutors have said Trump’s statements are no longer relevant since he has left office and the trade deal has already been signed.Defence lawyer Isabel Schurman said that position was untenable.“There has been no change in circumstance,” Schurman told the court, calling it “irrelevant” that the person who holds the office of U.S. president has changed.Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing broke down in the wake of Meng’s 2018 arrest. Days later, China detained two Canadians on espionage charges, which Canada viewed as retaliation.Biden said last month, in reference to the case and ensuing diplomatic conflict, “human beings are not bargaining chips.”Peck said the comment did not adequately repudiate the remarks of the previous president.“It’s too late,” he said. “The harm has been done and has existed for two years.”Defence lawyer Mona Duckett cited comments by Freeland that the United States should not “seek to politicize the extradition process,” following Trump’s comments, to support the claim of political interference in the case.Duckett also pointed to Trudeau’s December 2019 comment that the United States should not sign a final trade agreement with China without resolving the dispute over the two Canadians detained by China after Meng’s arrest.Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater said the quotes referenced by the defence were out of context and that the defence had ignored the presumption of good faith and inferred the worst.“That is not a fair way to look at this case,” he said.Earlier on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, said Canada should move quickly to release Meng to help restore relations between the two countries. “That will help to put our relationship back on the normal track,” Cong said in a virtual news conference on Twitter, repeating that China’s arrest of Canadians was not linked to the Meng case.Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday that at the time, Chinese officials made it clear that the arrest of the two Canadians was in response to Meng.“Nothing the ambassador can say now will dissuade me from understanding that is indeed the case,” he said.Meng’s case is scheduled to finish hearings in May.",Reuters

Look, I hope everybody’s realized by now, these masks make a difference.”Biden said the increasing availability of vaccinations was making a difference in containing the pandemic, but it was critical to remain vigilant about wearing masks, washing hands and social distancing.“The last thing, the last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that, ‘In the meantime, everything’s fine, take off your mask, forget it.’ It still matters,” Biden said before a brainstorming meeting with Republican and Democratic lawmakers to address cancer.Asked about Biden’s remarks, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves told Fox News Channel: “We no longer have a healthcare crisis in our state ... I wish the president would focus on trusting Americans rather than trying to insult Americans.”Biden said more than 511,000 people had died of the disease in the United States, and it would take time until everyone eligible was vaccinated.Cases of COVID-19 in the United States remain upwards of 50,000 daily even after the U.S. government has distributed more than 100 million vaccine doses and put shots into over 50 million arms, according to federal data.“It is critical, critical, critical, critical, that they follow the science: Wash your hands, Hot water, Do it frequently. Wear a mask and stay socially distanced. I know you know that. I wish the heck some of our elected officials would.”Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued the most sweeping rollback of coronavirus restrictions of any U.S. state on Tuesday, lifting a mask mandate and saying most businesses may open at full capacity next week.Reeves also lifted state-imposed mask mandates across Mississippi on Tuesday and removed COVID-19 related restrictions on business operations.White House senior adviser Andy Slavitt told reporters earlier the federal government is planning to spend $100 million to help the partnership between Merck & Co and rival Johnson & Johnson announced on Tuesday accelerate vaccine production.The infusion will help J&J ramp up production of its one-shot vaccine, Slavitt said.J&J was contracted to deliver 200 million doses to the federal government by the end of May and roughly a billion doses globally by end-2021.“Over time we believe Merck will be able to double the capacity of Johnson & Johnson,” Slavitt said.Biden said on Tuesday the United States will have enough vaccine supply to inoculate all adults by May.J&J, Pfizer Inc, and Moderna Inc are contracted to deliver 700 million doses by mid-year between them.",Reuters

This is about as busy as you‘ll get for weather across the country,” Chenard said on Friday.Bitter cold was already gripping the Plains on Friday, just a day after winter weather battered the United Statesfrom coast to coast, including freezing rain as far south as Fort Worth, Texas, where six people died in a multi-vehicle pileup.Temperatures as low as minus 45 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 43 Celsius) gripped Montana and Minnesota as cities such as Bismarck, North Dakota, shivered at minus 26 F (minus 32 C).“North Dakota is all fun and games until you have to be working in negative 40 degree weather,” @BricFlare wrote in a Twitter post.The Plains states will see significant snowfalls of 6 or more inches and freezing rain from Sunday into Monday, the weather service’s Chenard said, with the threat of freezing rain as far south as Houston and Louisiana.In the U.S. Northwest, snow and freezing rain blasting Portland, Oregon, and Seattle on Friday was expected to linger into Saturday.By Saturday night, freezing rain was expected in areas around the nation’s capital, including Virginia and Maryland, Chenard said.A wintry mix was expected to pelt the Northeast, where accumulations were expected to be minimal, although any slickness on roadways heightens travel risks.“It shouldn’t account for too much, but if it’s freezing rain, that can cause issues even if it’s light,” Chenard said.",Reuters
739,Delay in U.S. census data could muddle 2022 congressional elections,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-census/delay-in-u-s-census-data-could-muddle-2022-congressional-elections-idUSKBN2AC2G1,"(Reuters) - U.S. census data used once a decade to redraw legislative districts will not be made available until September, officials said on Friday, a delay that could make it difficult for states to finish new maps in time for the 2022 congressional elections.In announcing a new release date of Sept. 30, the Census Bureau cited lingering delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the bureau to shut down many of its data collection operations last spring as lockdowns swept the country.The bureau had previously set a target of July, which was already months later than the data is typically provided to states.Every 10 years, states employ the fresh census data to draw the lines for members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as thousands of state legislative offices.Some good-government groups have expressed concern that the compressed timeline could make it easier for lawmakers to engage in gerrymandering, the process by which maps are deliberately skewed to benefit one political party over another.If new maps are drawn late in 2021, that would leave little time for legal challenges to work their way through the courts before filing deadlines for elections. In Illinois and Texas, two states where one party holds unilateral power to redraw legislative boundaries, candidates must file before year’s end to run for office in 2022.“You’re starting to bump redistricting up against the election cycle,” said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. “There’s less time to challenge maps. That puts a lot of pressure on civil rights groups.”The only two states that have legislative elections in 2021, Virginia and New Jersey, will be forced to use existing maps as a result of the postponement.“This was a census like no other,” Kathleen Styles, a Census Bureau official, said on a call with reporters on Friday. “COVID-19 was definitely the driving factor in our schedule here.”The state-level population figures that determine whether states will gain or lose U.S. House seats will be available in April, but the more specific data needed to draw maps will be delayed.Democrats hold a slim 10-seat majority in the House, and some analysts have said that a combination of reapportionment and gerrymandering could be enough to swing the majority. Texas and Florida, two states that are controlled by Republicans and have seen aggressive gerrymanders in previous cycles, are expected to gain three seats and two seats, respectively.A Brennan Center analysis issued on Thursday found that Republicans would have sole control over the drawing of 181 congressional seats, compared with only 49 for Democrats.The delay also may force states to pass legislation extending redistricting deadlines or turn to the courts to seek extensions. Half of U.S. states have either a constitutional or statutory deadline calling for new maps in 2021, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",Reuters

It will carry a private UK food brand it’s calling “by Amazon” and will let consumers skip the checkout line when they shop.The opening is a sign of the Seattle-based company’s ambition to sell food globally and its belief that physical stores are a key way to capture consumers’ high spend on groceries, a category it has yet to dominate.It so far has worked toward that goal in the United States by acquiring the Whole Foods Market chain in 2017 and testing shoppers’ interests with an array of other formats: about two dozen cashierless convenience stores called Amazon Go, two Seattle-area Amazon Go Grocery stores that are about four times the size, and 10 Amazon Fresh supermarkets in California and Illinois.As in the Go stores, customers will scan a smartphone app to open the UK store’s entry gates. Ceiling cameras and shelf weight censors determine what shoppers add to their carts or put back, and their on-file credit cards are billed after they exit.The location, much smaller than a supermarket, will sell prepared meals, some groceries, and Amazon devices, as well as offer a counter for picking up and returning online orders.",Reuters
742,"Senate Democrats delay introduction of Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid bill
The U.S. Senate delayed the start of debate on President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill until at least Thursday after reaching a deal to phase out $1,400 payments to higher-income Americans in a compromise with moderate Democratic senators.

Before the bill hits the chamber floor, Democrats are negotiating limits to a measure Republicans have attacked as wasteful.The Senate will reconvene at noon (1700 GMT) on Thursday, said Senator Dick Durbin, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat. The House of Representatives canceled its Thursday session after the Capitol Police warned of a possible attack on the building by a militia group.Senate officials did not respond to questions about whether their security plans would change.Senate Democrats said the coronavirus stimulus proposal, which would block Americans earning $80,000 per year or more and couples earning $160,000 or more from receiving the $1,400 payments, was a good solution.The income cutoff had been higher - $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for couples filing jointly - in the version of the legislation passed by the Democratic-led House.Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat, told reporters: “I’m very pleased with the discussions and dialogues and some changes that have been agreed upon.” But he said he did not know the fate of another change he sought, to scale back enhanced unemployment benefits to $300 a week from $400.The compromise would mean about 9 million fewer households would get direct payments than did so in the last round of stimulus.The 100-seat Senate, where control is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, will at some point consider a motion to begin 20 hours of debate on the sweeping legislation. That vote could be an early indicator of how much Republican opposition the package faces.The bill would pay for vaccines and medical supplies, boost jobless assistance and send a new round of emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments. Democrats aim to get it to Biden to sign into law before March 14, when some current benefits expire.“The plan that we are going to vote on this week is going to provide real, robust relief for all of us,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have denounced the bill. On Wednesday, McConnell called it a “vast catalog of liberal spending” and a partisan “smorgasbord of borrowed money” packed with “crazy provisions” unrelated to the pandemic, which has killed more than 517,000 Americans and left millions more jobless.But a new Morning Consult/Politico poll showed strong bipartisan support for the measure despite the Republican attacks. It said 77% of all voters and 59% of Republicans backed the plan.Republicans said they would take steps to drag out work on the legislation. Senator Ron Johnson said he would insist that the entire bill, hundreds of pages long, be read to the Senate at the start of the debate, instead of the usual practice of just reading the title. That alone could take 10 hours, he said.In an interview with Wisconsin’s 1130 WISN News/Talk radio, Johnson also said he intended to keep offering amendments to the bill.Democrats have been seeking to sort out a welter of competing ideas as they seek to advance the bill.A minimum-wage increase sought by Biden was ruled out last week. The Senate parliamentarian said it could not be included in the package while the Democrats are using a special procedure that allows them to pass the bill with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the chamber.Democrats have shown no interest in dropping another partisan sticking point: $350 billion in aid for state and local governments, which face rising costs and uncertain tax revenues because of the pandemic.Once the Senate votes on the bill, the House would then have to sign off on the changes before Biden can sign it into law.",Reuters

Activist investors are pushing it to lessen its reliance on fossil fuels.“The priority right now is to rebuild the balance sheet,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on a media call following a virtual analysts day that emphasized the company’s commitment to lower spending and reducing debt, which has ballooned to $67.6 billion from $37.8 billion two years earlier.That said, some analysts criticized Exxon’s spending plans, saying the company’s focus is likely to shift more to oil than gas, unlike rivals Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell. It is also taking a measured approach to spending in its low-carbon group as other global oil giants aggressively move towards renewable projects.Woods reaffirmed plans to keep annual project spending at or below $19 billion in 2021 and between $20 billion and $25 billion through 2025. Production will remain largely flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day.Previously, Woods had planned to hike spending to as much as $35 billion per year to build production, but has reversed course after costly misfires on U.S. shale and Canadian oil sands.Shares rose 0.8% to $56.52. The stock is up more than a third this year, but over the longer term trails broader averages.Oil and gas production spending will focus on Guyana, Brazil and U.S. shale oil. The company expects its 400,000 barrels of daily output in west Texas and New Mexico to rise to about 700,000 by 2025, “based on market conditions,” said Senior Vice President Neil Chapman. Two years ago, it forecast 1 million barrels per day in the Permian as early as 2024.Overall output is likely “to steadily shift from gas to liquids, which is at odds with most peers,” said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets.Exxon vowed to increase its investments in carbon capture and storage as part of a new low-carbon business. Such efforts will account for about 3% of new spending, Exxon said, up from 1% previously.“It is still far from the double-digit levels of companies such as Shell and Total,” said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James.Exxon expects $2 billion of a proposed $3 billion in savings from workforce reductions and efficiencies, said Andrew Swiger, chief financial officer. It has said it could cut around 14,000 employees and contractors, or 15% of its global workforce, by the end of the year.Engine No. 1, an activist firm that is trying to place four new directors on Exxon’s board, was critical of the company’s efforts.“ExxonMobil today presented a vision of the future that we believe risks continued long-term value destruction, including a lack of serious diversification efforts and the hope that carbon capture will enable the company to avoid long-term evolution,” the firm said in a press release.On Monday, Exxon named activist investor Jeffrey Ubben and former Comcast executive Michael Angelakis to its board as it attempts to assuage investor concerns.“Maybe the best news about the board additions is that the ‘our way or the highway’ position that Exxon has taken for many years may be changing,” said Mark Stoeckle, senior portfolio manager at Adams Funds.",Reuters

U.S. President Joe Biden pushed for the first major legislative achievement of his term on Friday, turning to a bipartisan group of local officials for help on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden/biden-presses-for-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-plan-with-governors-mayors-idUSKBN2AC10D,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden pushed for the first major legislative achievement of his term on Friday, turning to a bipartisan group of local officials for help on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.Biden invited a set of mayors and governors to the Oval Office and described what he said was a need to give those officials more help supporting millions of unemployed workers and reopening schools.“We need to help the states economically in terms of unemployment,” Biden said during a small part of the meeting that was open to reporters. “The federal government has a major role to play here.”The White House summit came as public health officials in the administration readied new guidelines for reopening schools and as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said “the time to go big is now” as she pushed for more stimulus globally during the first meeting of the Group of Seven wealthy economies since the new U.S. administration took office.The Democratic president’s proposed spending package, coming on top of $4 trillion enacted by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, would have important consequences for a global economy that is slowly and unevenly recovering after last year suffering its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.More than 400 mayors wrote to leaders in Congress earlier this month to urge them to pass Biden’s relief package, but Republicans are backing a plan with a much smaller price tag.Taking part in the Oval Office meeting were Republican and Democratic elected officials whose states and cities have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Many have seen tax revenues fall and costs soar as they race to vaccinate their citizens.The group includes four governors, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, and five mayors, including Jeff Williams of Arlington, Texas, a Republican.Williams, who met with Yellen virtually last week, said his city urgently needs the federal aid earmarked for state and local governments in Biden’s rescue plan. He said cities were crushed when Congress removed similar aid from a previous relief bill that passed in December.“We’ve been crippled.

752,"If Senate does not convict Trump, 'he can do this again,' Democrats warn",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/if-senate-does-not-convict-trump-he-can-do-this-again-democrats-warn-idUSKBN2AB15F,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic prosecutors making the case that Donald Trump incited a deadly insurrection by encouraging his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol warned the Senate on Thursday that if it fails to convict the former president, “he can do this again.”The first three days of Trump’s impeachment trial focused on his fiery words to supporters in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, when he falsely claimed that his election defeat by Democrat Joe Biden was the result of fraud and that the crowd needed to “fight” and “stop the steal.”The Democrats appear highly unlikely to secure a conviction and bar Trump from ever again holding public office given that only six Republicans voted with Democrats in the 100-seat chamber to proceed with the trial.“If he gets back into office and it happens again, we’ll have no one to blame but ourselves,” lead impeachment manager Representative Jamie Raskin told the Senate on Thursday, wrapping up the prosecution arguments.Fellow Democratic Representative Ted Lieu told the senators he worries about what would happen if Trump runs in 2024 and loses.“I’m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I’m afraid he’s going to run again and lose, because he can do this again,” Lieu said.The Democratic prosecutors provided example after example of Trump’s actions prior to the rampage to illustrate what he intended when he told supporters to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell” as Congress convened to certify Biden’s election victory.“Jan. 6 was not some unexpected radical break from his normal law-abiding and peaceful disposition. ... This was his essential M.O.,” Raskin said, using shorthand for modus operandi.“He knew that egged on by his tweets, his lies and his promise of a ‘wild’ time in Washington to guarantee his grip on power, his most extreme followers would show up bright and early, ready to attack, ready to engage in violence, ready to ‘fight like hell’ for their hero,” he said.The Democratic-led House on Jan. 13 charged Trump with inciting an insurrection. His term ended on Jan. 20.A two-thirds majority in the Senate would be needed to convict, which means at least 17 Republican senators would have to defy Trump, who remains popular with most Republican voters and has shown interest in running for president again in 2024.Dozens of former Republican officials who said they are frustrated with their party’s unwillingness to stand up to Trump are in talks to form a center-right breakaway party, four people involved in the discussions told Reuters.The nine House impeachment managers have argued that Trump planted the seeds for the riot by encouraging violence and making false claims about widespread electoral fraud long before Jan. 6, and must be held accountable for what happened.Five people including a police officer died in the riot. Two more police officers involved in the response died by suicide in the days afterward.Although the prosecutors’ arguments were generally praised by both parties, some Republican senators said they were still not convinced.During a break in the proceedings on Thursday, Senator James Lankford told reporters that the managers failed to connect the dots between Trump and the rioters.Senator James Inhofe said: “It’s just redundant, the same thing over and over again. ... To me, the more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it.”Trump adviser Jason Miller said on Twitter that the defense would wrap up its case on Friday, and some Republican senators said they expected the proceedings to end on Saturday.Looking ahead to Trump’s defense, the House managers disagreed that his incendiary language is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects free speech.“The First Amendment does not create some superpower immunity from impeachment for a president who attacks the Constitution in word and deed while rejecting the outcome of an election,” Raskin said.The House managers spent much of Wednesday recounting the events that led to the riot and highlighting the threat to lawmakers and to Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president, including searing security footage.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden watched some of the video on Thursday morning, adding: “Anyone who watched that video ... found it harrowing and deeply disturbing. That’s certainly how the president felt.”In a separate court case, federal prosecutors said on Thursday that anti-government “Oath Keepers” militia members devised elaborate plans to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6 and plotted to have an armed “quick reaction force” staged outside the city ready “to fight hand to hand” if ordered by Trump.Trump is the first U.S. president to be impeached twice and the first to face trial after leaving office. His first impeachment trial, which stemmed from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, ended in an acquittal a year ago in what was then a Republican-controlled Senate.On Thursday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer left open the possibility that Congress might seek a different way to punish Trump if the Senate acquits him. That includes potentially invoking the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which gives Congress the power to bar public officials from holding office if they engaged in insurrection or rebellion.",Reuters
753,Prominent anti-Trump Republicans reject third party,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-third-party-insight/prominent-anti-trump-republicans-reject-third-party-idUSKBN2AC053,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former Republican officials considering a new center-right political party to counter former President Donald Trump’s influence would face steep challenges in shaking up a U.S. political system that has favored two-party rule throughout its history.Reuters exclusively reported on Wednesday that more than 120 Republicans - including former elected officials, along with former administrators under Trump and former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush - met virtually on Feb. 5 to discuss forming a third party or a new center-right faction.Two of the most prominent anti-Trump Republicans in Congress - Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois - rejected the idea of a breakaway party in statements to Reuters on Thursday. Other Republican critics of Trump expressed similar skepticism - arguing a third party would accomplish little beyond splitting the votes of conservatives and helping Democrats get elected.The resistance to a third party among some of Trump’s toughest Republican critics underscores the extreme difficulty of such a political revolt. Such an effort would require walking away from the Republican Party’s massive political infrastructure - staff, money, connections and data on donors and voters - that would take years if not decades to build from scratch.An upstart party would also have little chance of succeeding without a charismatic leader who could capture the loyalties of millions of disaffected voters, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a senior advisor to the Republican primary campaign of Marco Rubio, a Senator from Florida, in 2016.“If somebody was going to start a third party that was going to gain some traction, it would be Trump” and not his opponents, said Conant.Kinzinger joined the Feb. 5 video conference of the anti-Trump group and spoke for about five minutes, a spokeswoman told Reuters. But the congressman wants to “reform the party from within,” she said. He has recently formed a new political action committee to support Republican primary challengers running against pro-Trump House Republicans such as Matt Gaetz, of Florida, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia.A spokesman for Cheney told Reuters in a statement that she opposes “any effort to split the party,” saying it would only make it easier for Democrats to enact policies that conservatives oppose.Both Cheney and Kinzinger were among just 10 House Republicans, a small minority, who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.A more likely outcome of an anti-Trump movement would be for centrist Republicans to try to purge Trumpism from within its own ranks, said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida who recently quit the party in protest of Trump and declared himself an independent.A party of center-right conservatives could never create a broad enough coalition to win national elections, Jolly said. And Trump has effectively undercut his more moderate opponents among Republican voters, he said, by ridiculing them as “Never Trumpers” and “RINOs” (Republicans in Name Only).“It’s just impossible to escape the ‘never Trump’ label,” he said.Others argue it would be much harder to wrest power over the Republican Party from Trump.“Let’s not kid ourselves; we are not going to change this party,” said Jim Glassman, a former undersecretary of state under George W. Bush.Glassman gave a five-minute presentation on the Feb. 5 call advocating for a new party. Any effort to reclaim the party would be “a soul-deadening slog,” he told participants.He told Reuters on Thursday that he sees the Republican Party as now thoroughly in thrall to Trump - and beyond repair.“I thought, if Trump lost by 7 million votes, there may have been a chance to do that,” he said in an interview. “But events since the election have made clear that’s not going to happen.”Asked on Wednesday about the discussions for a third party, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said: “These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.”Glassman believes there are enough Republican donors who are disgusted with Trump and willing to finance a new party. He believes a new conservative party could also attract maybe one fifth of Republican voters who disapprove of Trump, along with some independents and Democrats. Further, he said, running third-party candidates in House and Senate races would force the Trumpist candidates to tack to the center in general elections and temper the shrill partisanship of those races.Many people at the Feb. 5 virtual gathering agreed with Glassman. In a poll of participants, about 40% of those in attendance supported creating an entirely new party, according to one source with direct knowledge of the discussions. About 20% favored creating a faction within the party, and an equal number supported creating a faction outside the party, though it remained unclear exactly how such an independent faction would operate.While they disagreed on strategy, participants in the meeting said, attendees united on the need to organize and advocate for a return to “principled conservatism” that prizes the rule of law and adherence to the Constitution, ideals they believe Trump has violated.Among the group at the Feb. 5 meeting was Elizabeth Neumann, former deputy chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump. She’s enraged at Republican lawmakers’ continued support for Trump in the wake of his stolen-election claims, which she had repeatedly warned - before the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots - could lead to violence. Now she wants to politically target the lawmakers who voted, in the hours after the deadly insurrection, to overturn the presidential election result - and she’s open to any strategy that might work.“I hear arguments that we should break off and form a new party, or we should stay inside the party. There will come a time when this crystallizes,” Neumann told Reuters on Thursday. “At the moment, I’m more focused on the individual people and holding them accountable.”Historically, third parties have generally failed in U.S. elections, particularly at the presidential level, often serving more as spoilers than true contenders.Theodore Roosevelt, a charismatic war hero, had served two previous terms as president but lost in 1912 when he ran as a Progressive - or “Bull Moose” - Party candidate, finishing second, with more votes than the Republican candidate, in a three-way race ultimately won by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. That was the last time any third-party candidate won more votes than either of the two major party presidential candidates.More recently, the most successful third-party candidate was Texas billionaire Ross Perot, whose self-financed Reform Party campaign in 1992 earned him 19% of the vote in a race won by Democrat Bill Clinton, who unseated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush.In other cases, supporters of losing presidential nominees have blamed third-party candidates for siphoning off voters. In 2016, some backers of Democrat Hillary Clinton were frustrated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose percentage of the vote was greater than Clinton’s margin of defeat in key states.Republican Senator Rand Paul, asked about the prospects for a new party, told Reuters: “That’d be a good way to allow the Democrats to always win.”Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn laughed when asked by Reuters about a possible third party.“More power to ‘em,” he said.Cornyn, however, predicted shared opposition to President Biden’s agenda will hold Republicans together. He said he hopes life in the Republican Party will return to something more normal in Trump’s absence.“It’s made us all a little crazy,” Cornyn said.",Reuters

755,"U.S. economy got off to modest start in 2021, Fed says
The U.S. economic recovery continued at a modest pace over the first weeks of this year, with businesses optimistic about the months to come and demand for housing ""robust,"" but the job market showing only slow improvement, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-beige/u-s-economy-got-off-to-modest-start-in-2021-fed-says-idUSKBN2AV2J3,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economic recovery continued at a modest pace over the first weeks of this year, with businesses optimistic about the months to come and demand for housing “robust,” but the job market showing only slow improvement, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.“Economic activity expanded modestly from January to mid-February for most” of the Fed’s 12 regional districts, the U.S. central bank said in its latest “Beige Book” compendium of anecdotes about the economy. “Most businesses remain optimistic regarding the next 6-12 months as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely distributed.”The Fed, however, reported that the labor market, which remains about 10 million jobs short of where it was before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, was not gaining as much traction as had been hoped.“Most Districts reported that employment levels rose over the reporting period, albeit slowly,” the Fed said, an outcome disappointing to officials who have hoped their efforts to support the recovery would pay off in faster job creation.There were reports of labor shortages among some businesses due to the pandemic and related issues like child care, rising prices in some sectors as commodity and other input costs increased, and some wage pressures to fill open jobs.In the Philadelphia Fed’s district, some contacts noted the debate in Washington over whether to impose a $15 minimum wage, and while several “worry about a potential minimum wage increase, one contact said that wages were rising because of demand for labor – ‘the $15.00 minimum is already here.’ Another pointed to job ads offering $23 an hour for warehouse jobs.”But for the parts of the economy hardest hit by the pandemic, including the leisure and hospitality sectors, there was little sign of improvement so far. Hotel buildings and other commercial real estate investments tied to those industries “deteriorated somewhat,” the Fed said in its report.The report represented “a slight upgrade” to the one issued in January, with a few more Fed districts reporting at least modest economic growth, said Krishna Guha, vice-chairman at ISI Evercore. Moreover, “there are few signs of imminent price acceleration” that might challenge the Fed’s commitment to maintaining low interest rates.The Fed is due to hold its next policy meeting in two weeks, amid an increasing sense that the risks from the pandemic will subside, and the economy start to register strong growth.The boost in the economic outlook, driven by the expanding U.S. COVID-19 vaccination program and the potential for a $1.9 trillion federal spending package, has led to market speculation the Fed may be forced to scale back its support for the economy sooner than expected.Fed officials in recent days have rebutted that idea by noting the long list of problems still on the table, from high joblessness to weak inflation, that would need to ease before it considers any change in monetary policy.The latest Beige Book report gave voice to what recent economic data has shown: an economy whose breakout potential is so far just that, an aspiration that has not yet proved itself as the virus and recovery continue a tug of war.In the Boston Fed district, those in the restaurant industry, “were optimistic for the first time since the pandemic began,” but at the same time faced the fact that with the virus still not controlled, “conventions that were supposed to take place in the Boston area during the summer of 2021 were postponed.”About 15% of the U.S. population has been vaccinated with at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Yet COVID-19 cases are being added at rate of around 50,000 daily, a decline from the winter surge but proof the virus is still in circulation.At a time when forecasters anticipate economic growth perhaps rivaling the record rates seen immediately after World War Two, officials across the Fed’s districts stuck to words like “modest” and “slight” to describe the pace of the current rebound.The brightest spot perhaps was residential real estate, where a number of districts reported continued strength, with factors such as the rise of remote work prompting people to relocate.“Contacts from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Maine saw high numbers of out-of-state buyers, especially for homes in vacation communities,” the Boston Fed reported. A Massachusetts contact said low interest rates and flexible work arrangements had “likely provided a boost” to demand for vacation homes.Housing prices in many districts rose sharply as buyers competed for a limited supply of homes. In the Richmond district, some realtors reported that houses “frequently sell within an hour, often sight-unseen.”",Reuters
756,"Minneapolis Fed casts broader net to gauge state of U.S. economy
The Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank's section of a key U.S. central bank report on Wednesday for the first time flagged insights on the state of the U.S. economy from the perspectives of workers and of minority- and women-owned businesses.

It is a compendium of data and anecdotes gathered by each of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks on current economic conditions, based on surveys of and interviews with key business contacts.In Wednesday’s Beige Book, the Minneapolis Fed added two new subsections - titled “Worker Experience” and “Minority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprises” - to the usual sections it and other banks typically include on employment and wages, inflation, and economic activity across key sectors like manufacturing, services and farming.Businesses said job postings were picking up and there were not enough workers, especially for lower-paying jobs, the report showed.Talking to workers, Mahon said, the Minneapolis Fed heard a lot about what keeps people from going back to work, including family care responsibilities, remote learning or fear of infection. The report also highlighted the challenges many workers in the district face on the job or in their hunt for employment, including a rise in employers demanding 12-hour shifts and transportation hurdles for low-income workers.The added color is important, Mahon said: “If you are only talking to businesses then you are only getting one side of the story.”Last October Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari had flagged the coming change, noting that businesses are overrepresented in the Beige Book data and promising to fix that, at least in his section of the report.The bank’s new section on minority- and women-owned businesses highlighted that many business contacts in that category “noted hesitancy among immigrant business owners to apply for assistance out of concern for jeopardizing the immigration status of themselves or family members.”Mahon said he didn’t know if other Fed banks are planning to follow suit with their own Beige Book changes, but said he thought they were “broadly supportive” of the work.“As a system we are committed to making sure that economic growth is inclusive and that we are understanding how broadly shared our economic growth or the path of the economy is,” he said.",Reuters

Indigenous people from Brazil and Colombia sued retailer Casino in a French court on Wednesday over the selling of beef linked to land grabbing and deforestation in the Amazon, campaigners involved in the lawsuit said.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-casino-amazon-lawsuit/indigenous-amazonians-sue-retailer-casino-over-rainforest-destruction-idUSKBN2AV1UY,"PARIS (Reuters) - Indigenous people from Brazil and Colombia sued retailer Casino in a French court on Wednesday over the selling of beef linked to land grabbing and deforestation in the Amazon, campaigners involved in the lawsuit said.It is the first time a French supermarket chain has been taken to court over deforestation and the loss of land and livelihood under a 2017 law in France that demands its companies avoid human rights and environmental violations in their supply chains.Casino, which controls Brazil’s largest food retailer, Grupo Pao de Acucar (GPA) and through that also Colombian retailer Almacenes Exito, said it actively fought against deforestation by cattle ranchers in Brazil and Colombia.The lawsuit alleges Casino regularly bought beef from three slaughterhouses owned by a major Brazilian meatpacker.Those slaughterhouses sourced cattle from nearly 600 suppliers responsible for at least 50,000 hectares (123,550 acres) -- an area five times the size of Paris -- of deforestation between 2008 and 2020, according to the lawsuit.“The demand for beef by Casino and Pão de Açúcar brings deforestation and land grabbing and violence,” Luis Eloy Terena of COIAB, a body coordinating indigenous groups in the Brazilian Amazon, said in a statement.Casino said GPA applied a rigorous policy of controlling the origin of beef delivered by its suppliers, adding Brazilian beef was not sold in its French stores.GPA told Reuters that since 2016 it had established criteria that its suppliers must comply with. They included “zero Amazon deforestation, no slave-like labour conditions, no child labour and no invasions of indigenous land or conservation areas.” Ranchers must hold land ownership documents, it added.Brazil is Casino’s second largest market after France.“Sustainable ranching is one of the focal points of the company’s sustainability strategy,” Almacenes Exito’s parent company Grupo Exito said in response to questions, calling itself a pioneer in implementation of the practice in Colombian retail.Grupo Exito added that it monitors all of the more than 91,400 acres (36,990 hectares) of land used by its suppliers, built its sustainability plans in partnership with conservation NGOs and has signed zero-deforestation commitments.The Amazon plays a vital role in regulating the Earth’s climate by absorbing carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases responsible for global warming.An area of the Amazon rainforest the size of Israel was felled last year, campaign groups say, and cattle ranching is a leading driver of habitat loss, as population growth and the expanding middle classes of developing nations fuel the consumption of meat and dairy.Sebastian Mabile, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said Casino and its subsidiary had failed in their obligations to scrutinise their supply chains.“We want them to pay approximately 3 million euros to the organisations that represent indigenous peoples and ensure that their activities do not entail deforestation,” Mabile told a news conference.Companies are under growing pressure from national legislation and campaigners to protect the Amazon.French bank BNP Paribas in February pledged to only finance companies producing beef or soybeans in Latin America that adopt a strategy of zero deforestation by 2025.In January, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and Dutch lender ING announced they were to stop financing the trade in crude oil from Ecuador. Indigenous leaders said the banks’ money made them complicit in the destruction of rainforest by Ecuador’s oil industry.Plaintiffs to the lawsuit include French and U.S. campaign groups.",Reuters

The heavily-shorted stock had surged more than 70% on Tuesday in a move that analysts said was likely sparked by bearish investors unwinding bets against the stock as its share price surged.However, the stock’s gains appear to have drawn more investors betting against Rocket’s shares.The value of Rocket shares shorted stood at $2.04 billion as of Tuesday’s close, accounting for 45.15% of the float, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.That’s just a tick down from Monday, when 45.83% shares of the float were shorted.“We are seeing existing shorts who have incurred large mark-to-market losses getting squeezed out of their trades, but there are new shorts looking to get in at these elevated prices,” Dusaniwsky said.Rocket short-sellers were down $491 million overall in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, having cut the loss by more than half with Tuesday’s share price decline as of afternoon trading, S3 data showed.Rocket’s Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner lauded the company’s fundamentals on Wednesday during Morgan Stanley’s Technology, Media & Telecom conference, saying he was bullish on where the company was headed.Shares in mortgage lender UWM Holdings Corp, which went public through a $16-billion deal with a blank-check firm, were up over 10% on Wednesday, after rising as much as 36% earlier in the session.The outsized move in its share price puts Rocket among the stocks that have experienced wild gyrations after becoming a focus of investors on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets. GameStop, perhaps the best known of the so-called meme stocks, saw its shares rise 1600% in January before paring much of those gains the following month.Rocket’s management has taken short-sellers of the stock head-on by recently announcing a $1.11 per share special dividend.Investor appetite toward mortgage vendors this month is a stark contrast to their recent outlook on the sector. A slew of canceled initial public offerings in recent months pointed to fears that the U.S. housing market may have reached a peak.",Reuters

Refining capacity use fell to just 56% of overall capacity, the lowest on record, as the U.S. Gulf Coast’s refining capacity use plunged to 40.9%, the lowest ever.Brent crude rose $1.37, or 2.2%, to settle at $64.07 a barrel.

That margin suggested Democrats face an uphill climb in trying to convict the man who still remains popular with Republican voters.Oklahoma Senator James Lankford on Wednesday appeared emotional at his desk after Eric Swalwell, one of the House impeachment managers, finished his presentation. Another senator, Steve Daines, put his hand on Lankford’s arm in what appeared to be a gesture of comfort.But speaking to reporters later, Lankford struggled to connect the visceral images to any culpability for Trump, who in a fiery speech before the attack on the Capitol urged his supporters to “fight” his election defeat.“He’s had 100 rallies and we’ve never seen that before. So that’s the tough one to be able to link together,” Lankford said.Separately, Florida Senator Rick Scott said he was “disgusted” by the behavior of the rioters.But asked whether Trump bore responsibility, he said, “You know, I’ve watched what he said. He’s never said that somebody should break in. He actually said that people should do this peacefully ... Look, this is a complete waste of time.”Kansas Senator Jerry Moran called the videos “heart-wrenching.” But asked if he saw a link between the footage and Trump’s words, he said: “I’ll wait ‘til the conclusion of the trial.”Indiana Senator Mike Braun called the footage “riveting.”“But I don’t know that that’s going to make a difference for any one senator just having it on a loop again,” he said.Trump’s lawyer, Bruce Castor, agreed the House impeachment managers’ footage was emotional, but he seemed unworried about his client’s chances.“I believe it would have an emotional impact on any jury but ... and we haven’t played ours,” said Castor.",Reuters

768,"U.S. private payrolls rise modestly, worker shortages emerging
U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in February amid job losses in manufacturing and construction, suggesting the labor market was struggling to regain speed despite the nation's improving public health picture.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-private-payrolls-rise-modestly-worker-shortages-emerging-idUSKBN2AV1KF,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in February amid job losses in manufacturing and construction, suggesting the labor market was struggling to regain speed despite the nation’s improving public health picture.Part of the labor market’s problems appear to be rooted in a shortage of workers. Other data on Wednesday showed job growth in the services industry retreated last month, with businesses reporting they were “unable to fill vacant positions with qualified applicants” and “need more resources to meet demand.”That was also corroborated by the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book report, which noted “continued difficulties attracting and retaining qualified workers” by many of the U.S. central bank’s contacts last month, with labor shortages “most acute among low-skill occupations and skilled trade positions.”The year-long COVID-19 pandemic is keeping some workers at home, fearful of accepting or returning to jobs that could expose them to the coronavirus. The data was published ahead of the government’s closely watched employment report on Friday, and could temper expectations for an acceleration in job growth in February. The ADP’s private payrolls report, however, has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count in the government’s more comprehensive employment report.“This is a disappointment given that the drop-off in coronavirus case numbers and the resulting lifting of containment measures should be giving the economy a bigger shot in the arm,” said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.Private payrolls rose by 117,000 jobs last month after increasing 195,000 in January, the ADP National Employment Report showed. The report is jointly developed with Moody’s Analytics. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls increasing by 177,000 jobs in February.Construction employment fell by 3,000 jobs and manufacturing payrolls decreased 14,000. Hiring in the services sector increased by 131,000 jobs, with the leisure and hospitality industry adding 26,000 positions. Harsh weather in some parts of the country was also likely a factor holding back gains.Graphic: ADP -Still, the labor market has been slow to regain traction even as some restrictions on services businesses have been rolled back amid a drop in new COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. Though the rate of decline in coronavirus cases has stalled, economists still believe the labor market will accelerate in the spring and through summer.In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its measure of services sector employment fell to a reading of 52.7 in February from 55.2 in January.The lack of significant improvement in the labor market is also despite nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government in late December, which boosted consumer spending and positioned the economy for faster growth in the first quarter.Gross domestic product growth estimates for the first quarter have been raised to as high as a 10% annualized rate from as low as a 2.3% pace. The upgrades also reflect President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion recovery plan, under consideration by Congress. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter.“Historically, employment lags GDP by a quarter or so,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “Everything from that (GDP) front looks good, we are expecting substantial job growth in the not-too-distant future.”Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government will likely report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 180,000 jobs in February after rising only 49,000 in January.Hopes for a pick-up in hiring last month were supported by a survey last week showing consumers’ perceptions of the labor market improved in February after deteriorating in January and December. In addition, a measure of manufacturing employment hit a two-year high in February.The retrenchment in services employment last month contributed to the ISM’s broader non-manufacturing activity index declining to a nine-month low of 55.3 in February from 58.7 in January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.Brutal winter storms lashed Texas and parts of the populous South region in mid-February.The lack of qualified workers at suppliers and manufacturers is creating bottlenecks in the supply chain, sticking businesses with higher production costs. The survey’s measure of prices paid by services industries jumped to 71.8, the highest since September 2008, from 64.2 in January.It mirrored findings of the ISM’s manufacturing survey this week and a surge in consumers’ near-term inflation expectations.Graphic: ISM PMI - tmsnrt.rs/3bcGFr7Inflation is expected to accelerate in part as last year’s pandemic-driven weak readings drop out of the calculation. Economists are divided on whether the jump in price pressures will stick beyond the so-called base effects.U.S. Treasury yields have risen, with investors betting that the Fed’s ultra-easy monetary policy stance and White House’s proposed massive stimulus will ignite inflation.Many services businesses complained about supply delays and raw material shortages caused by the dearth of workers. Wholesalers reported an “ongoing influx of price increases due to raw-material shortages.” Retailers said “price increases are occurring with more frequency,” while accommodation and food services noted suppliers were proposing “price increases that are above and beyond normal expectations.”",Reuters

Newly-formed Stellantis, a combination of Peugeot-maker PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), wants to use its clout to take on rivals racing to produce more electric vehicles, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Wednesday.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stellantis-results/no-dinosaur-carmaker-stellantis-steps-up-electric-ambitions-idUSKBN2AV0UE,"MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Newly-formed Stellantis, a combination of Peugeot-maker PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), wants to use its clout to take on rivals racing to produce more electric vehicles, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Wednesday.Stellantis is now the world’s fourth largest carmaker, with 14 brands including Opel, Jeep, Ram and Maserati, and like its peers, it is grappling with a shortage of semiconductors and investments in electric vehicles.Low global car inventories and cost cuts should help boost profit margins this year, though the carmaker is also looking beyond savings, Tavares said.“This is not a crisis merger,” he told an analyst conference, after Stellantis forecast higher profitability for 2021 and PSA and Fiat which merged in January reported better-than-expected results for 2020.“This is a merger that is going to open new opportunities for a company that is sound, with talented people ... who do not want to be cornered in a legacy or a dinosaur position.”Stellantis aims to deliver over 5 billion euros a year in savings through the merger, as well as bulking up to face industry challenges.Automakers are racing to develop electric vehicles to meet tighter CO2 emissions targets in Europe and this week Volvo joined a growing number of carmakers aiming for a fully-electric line-up by 2030.Stellantis plans to have fully-electric or hybrid versions of all of its vehicles available in Europe by 2025, broadly in line with plans at top rivals such as Volkswagen and Renault-Nissan, although Stellantis has further to go to meet that goal.The group said 2021 results should be helped by three new high-margin Jeep vehicles in North America and a strong pricing environment there. The U.S. market has driven profits for years at FCA and starts off as the strongest part of Stellantis.The carmaker is targeting an adjusted operating profit margin of 5.5%-7.5% this year.That compares with a 5.3% aggregated margin last year: 4.3% at FCA and 7.1% at PSA excluding a controlling stake in parts maker Faurecia, which is set to be spun-off from Stellantis shortly.Tavares said he did not consider the guidance to be cautious. It assumes no more significant lockdowns caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, but the executive warned of other headwinds including the rising price of raw materials.The industry is being squeezed by a COVID-19-related global shortage of semiconductors, used for everything from maximising engine fuel economy to driver-assistance features.Tavares said the problems might not be fully resolved by the second half of 2021, as some auto rivals have flagged, describing supplies as the “big unknown” for revenues in 2021.The group is now working through reorganising some of its factory set-ups, though it has pledged to close no plants, and finalising new management teams.Priorities for 2021 will also include defining a strategy for China, Tavares said, where some Stellantis brands have struggled more than rivals.Tavares, who previously ran PSA, achieved an improvement in margins at the French carmaker by cutting costs, simplifying its vehicle line-up and delivering synergies on its purchase of Opel/Vauxhall, a strategy investors hope he can replicate.Combined adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) amounted to 7.1 billion euros ($8.6 billion) at the group last year. At the end of 2020, combined liquidity stood at 57.4 billion euros and free cash flow at 3.3 billion euros.Stellantis is planning a capital markets day for late 2021 or early 2022. The group’s shares closed flat on Wednesday.($1 = 0.8277 euros)",Reuters
775,"GM extends production cuts due to chip shortage, Stellantis warns of lingering pain
The global semiconductor chip shortage led General Motors Co on Wednesday to extend production cuts at three North American plants and add a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Stellantis to warn the pain could linger far into the year.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-semiconductors-exclusive/gm-extends-production-cuts-due-to-chip-shortage-stellantis-warns-of-lingering-pain-idUSKBN2AV1QS,"DETROIT/LONDON (Reuters) - The global semiconductor chip shortage led General Motors Co on Wednesday to extend production cuts at three North American plants and add a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Stellantis to warn the pain could linger far into the year.The extended cuts do not change GM’s forecast last month that the shortage could shave up to $2 billion from this year’s earnings. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson subsequently said chip supplies should return to normal rates by the second half of the year and he was confident the profit hit would not worsen.However, Stellantis on Wednesday did not give an estimate for the financial hit it expects this year from the shortage and said the issue could last into the second half of 2021.The chip shortage, which has hit automakers globally, stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tight chip supplies. They also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies.GM did not disclose the impact on volumes or say which supplier or parts were affected by the chip shortage, but the U.S. automaker said it intends to recover as much of the lost output as possible.“GM continues to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including full-size trucks and SUVs,” GM spokesman David Barnas said. “We contemplated this downtime when we discussed our outlook for 2021.”GM said it would extend downtime at plants in Fairfax, Kansas, and Ingersoll, Ontario, to at least mid-April, and in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, through the end of March. In addition, it will idle its Gravatai plant in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in April and May.The Detroit automaker had previously extended production cuts at three North American plants into mid-March and said vehicles at two other plants would only be partially built. Following Wednesday’s cuts, forecasting firm AutoForecast Solutions estimated GM could lose more than 216,000 units globally due to the shortage.While reporting quarterly results on Wednesday, Stellantis said the chip shortage could weigh on 2021 earnings and Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer told analysts on a conference call the financial impact was a “big unknown.”Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the automaker was working hard to find alternative chip supplies, but he was “not so sure” the issue would be resolved by the second half of 2021.Ford Motor Co said last month the lack of chips could cut company production by up to 20% in the first quarter and hurt profits by as much as $2.5 billion. It had previously cut production of its top-selling F-150 pickup truck.Some automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co, avoided deeper cuts by stockpiling chips ahead of the shortage.Industry officials and politicians have pushed U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration to take a more active role in dealing with the chip shortage.Last week, Biden said he would seek $37 billion in funding to supercharge chip manufacturing in the United States. An executive order also launched a review of supply chains for such critical products as semiconductor chips, electric vehicle batteries and rare earth minerals.Complicating matters was a severe winter storm in Texas last month that killed at least 21 people and led to the shutdown of several chip plants.

SK said the carve-out periods “do not provide a solution.”LG Chem did not immediately comment.",Reuters

President Joe Biden promised he would never politicize the U.S. military as he made his first visit to the Pentagon as commander-in-chief on Wednesday, seeking to draw a contrast with the Trump-era in a far-reaching speech that emphasized diversity in the armed forces.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-defense/in-pentagon-debut-biden-promises-break-from-trump-era-politicization-of-military-idUSKBN2AA2X2,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden promised he would never politicize the U.S. military as he made his first visit to the Pentagon as commander-in-chief on Wednesday, seeking to draw a contrast with the Trump-era in a far-reaching speech that emphasized diversity in the armed forces.Biden, whose late son, Beau, was a soldier who deployed to Iraq, bristled at former President Donald Trump’s approach to the military during the presidential campaign, including a report that Trump once privately called American soldiers killed during World War One “losers” and “suckers.”Critics say Trump openly flouted norms of behavior in open pursuit of political support among U.S. troops, who are meant to be loyal to the U.S. Constitution - not any party or political movement.“I will never ever dishonor you, I will never disrespect you, I will never politicize the work you do,” Biden said from the Pentagon briefing room.He added: “This is personal for me. The Biden family is a military family.”Pentagon leadership is under pressure to show progress in combating white nationalism and other extremism in the ranks, after current and former military service members were found to have participated in the pro-Trump siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.On Tuesday, the U.S. Navy’s top admiral condemned two racist incidents involving hate symbols on warships, which sources said included a noose that was left on a Black sailor’s bed.Biden made history by naming retired Army general Lloyd Austin the first Black U.S. defense secretary. In his Pentagon address on Wednesday, Biden stressed other groundbreaking achievements by Black soldiers, from pilots who fought in World War Two to soldiers who fought in the Civil War.“Right now, more than 40 percent of our active duty forces are people of color. Now it’s long past time that the full diversity and full strength of our forces are reflected at every level of this department,” Biden said.Still, discrimination persists in the U.S. military.Reuters was first to report last month that nearly a third of Black U.S. military service members indicated that they experienced racial discrimination, harassment or both during a 12-month period, according to a Defense Department survey that was withheld during much of the Trump administration.During his first days in office, Biden signed an executive order that overturned a ban Trump on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.Biden noted that Austin, upon taking over as defense secretary, ordered a review of sexual assault cases.“This administration ... is dedicated to ensuring that every single person is treated with dignity and respect,” Biden said.Biden’s visit, which included a tour of a Pentagon exhibition honoring Black service members, sharply contrasted with Trump’s Pentagon debut in 2017. Trump used the opportunity to sign an executive order prohibiting refugees from Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.Still, it left many questions unanswered about Biden’s approach to the Pentagon as speculation mounts about potential cuts to defense spending, the two-decade-old war in Afghanistan, future U.S. deployments to the Middle East and Asia and tensions with Iran.Biden announced plans for a Pentagon review of strategy toward China but there was no sign for now of any shift in the U.S. approach.Biden was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first Black American and the first Asian American to hold the second highest U.S. office.Harris paid tribute to barrier-breaking Black servicemembers.“They didn’t just join to make history.

Trump’s administration had sided with the states challenging Obamacare. A ruling is due by the end of June.Biden’s administration notified the court of the government’s new position in a letter filed by Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler.The case represents the latest Republican legal attack on Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. Republicans failed numerous times to repeal it in Congress, and Trump’s administration took steps to hobble the law.Biden, who was Obama’s vice president when the law was enacted, has promised to protect and build on Obamacare, which has enabled millions of Americans to obtain health insurance by expanding public healthcare programs and creating marketplaces for private insurance. Republicans have called it a government overreach.The position reversal at the Supreme Court was expected considering Biden’s public statements on Obamacare, and Kneedler said there is no need for further legal briefing before the court decides the case. The law had been defended in the case by Democratic-led states and the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.At the heart of the case is whether a provision of the law called the “individual mandate” that required Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a financial penalty was lawful. The Republican challengers had argued that the mandate was unconstitutional and that, as a result, the entire law should be struck down.Kneedler told the court that the government “no longer adheres to the conclusions in the previously filed brief” submitted by Trump’s administration. The Biden administration believes that the individual mandate was constitutional and, even if it was not, the rest of the law should remain in place, Kneedler added.During the argument in November, it appeared unlikely the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, would strike down the entire law.",Reuters

But the company did not issue an earnings outlook, saying it intended to sacrifice profitability to win market share.The company reported a net loss of 151 million euros for 2020, widening from 103.1 million euros in 2019.Last year Takeaway also agreed to buy U.S. peer Grubhub in a $7.3 billion deal that would make it the largest food delivery company outside China.It reiterated on Wednesday that deal is set to close in the first half of 2021, pending approval from Grubhub shareholders.Shares in Takeaway rose 2.6% to 82.16 by 0825 GMT, but below the nearly 100 euros they traded for in June when it announced the all-share offer for Grubhub.Takeaway said it had rejected a 2.3 billion euro offer for its 33% stake in iFood of Brazil, which is majority owned by tech giant Prosus.

Additional footage came from an Alabama jail, hospital rooms, a police interview area and a community gym.Kottmann declined to identify other members of the group. The hackers sought to draw attention to the pervasive monitoring of people after having found login information for Verkada’s administrative tools publicly online this week, Kottmann said.Verkada acknowledged an intrusion, saying it had disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent unauthorized access.“Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this issue, and we have notified law enforcement” and customers, the company said.Kottmann said Verkada cut off the hackers’ access hours before Bloomberg first reported the breach on Tuesday.The hacking group, if it had chosen, could have used its control of the camera gear to access other parts of company networks at Tesla and software makers Cloudflare Inc and Okta Inc, according to Kottmann.Cloudflare said its security measures are designed to block a small leak from becoming a wider intrusion, and that no customer data were affected.Okta said it was continuing to investigate but that its service was not affected.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.A list of Verkada user accounts provided by the hacking group and seen by Reuters includes thousands of organizations, including gym chain Bay Club and transportation technology startup Virgin Hyperloop.Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the list or screenshots distributed by Kottmann, but they included detailed data and matched other materials from Verkada.Madison County Jail in Alabama, Bay Club and Virgin Hyperloop did not respond to requests for comment.Verkada says on its website it has over 5,200 customers, including cities, colleges and hotels. Its cameras have proved popular because they pair with software to search for specific people or items. Users can access feeds remotely through the cloud.In a 2018 interview with Reuters, Chief Executive Filip Kaliszan said Verkada had deliberately made it easy for many users at an organization to watch live video feeds and securely share them, such as with emergency responders.Verkada has raised $139 million in venture capital, with the latest financing announced a year ago valuing the Silicon Valley startup at $1.6 billion.Verkada drew scrutiny last year after Vice reported that some employees had used company cameras and its facial recognition technology to take and share photos of female colleagues.

Four thousand kilometres from Moscow near the shores of the Angara River, a Russian firm operating a vast data centre run on cheap local hydroelectric power is reaping the rewards of bitcoin's surging prices and plans to double its power output this year.
MAR 09 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cryptocurrencies-bitriver/remote-siberian-data-center-reaps-rewards-of-bitcoin-rally-idUSKBN2B11RJ,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Four thousand kilometres from Moscow near the shores of the Angara River, a Russian firm operating a vast data centre run on cheap local hydroelectric power is reaping the rewards of bitcoin’s surging prices and plans to double its power output this year.BitRiver hosts equipment at its flagship 100-megawatt data centre in the city of Bratsk, along with other smaller sites, for foreign miners of the cryptocurrency from the United States, Europe and Japan who want to harness the region’s cheap energy.The company could already be responsible for as much as 2% of global bitcoin mining, Chief Executive Igor Runets estimated, but added precise figures in the sector were hard to come by.The price of bitcoin has risen almost 300% since the start of November and topped $50,000 dollars for the first time last month, as Tesla Inc bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin and other large companies and investment houses followed small traders into the asset.Bitcoin is earned -- or ‘mined’ -- by using your computer to help process the uncrackable “blockchains” or digital transaction records that underpin the currency.This requires huge computing capacity, and a lot of electricity, and so is mostly done with huge machines in aircraft hangar-sized warehouses in the cooler climates of Iceland, Canada, northern China and Russia, where it costs less to disperse the heat generated.The rewards for those who can verify transactions in the process which produces bitcoins have never been greater.“Current demand from our clients exceeds 700 megawatts and is approaching one gigawatt,” said Runets. “We will of course continue to build data processing centres. In 2021, we plan to reach 300 megawatts of power.”Another 100-megawatt centre is already under construction in the neighbouring Buryatiya region, Runets said.Big deals with foreign firms, such as one last December which saw 14 lorries full of equipment arrive in Bratsk, can boost the local economy and are a sign that BitRiver has become a global player, he said in a company video.Russia granted cryptocurrencies legal status last year, but banned them from being used as a means of payment.“Current legislation in Russia does not hamper us in any way,” Runets said. “It allows us to host foreign clients’ computing equipment on Russian territory with settlements for this in dollars or roubles.”This arrangement reduces the financial impact of bitcoin price swings on BitRiver.“When bitcoin falls or rises, my profit, my revenue remains almost unchanged,” Runets said. “This financial stability in a volatile market is very valuable.”More liberal legislation would lead to greater investment from Russian players, Runets added, which could help BitRiver improve on its 2.5x year-on-year revenue growth in 2020. He declined to disclose further financial details.One of the primary concerns levelled at bitcoin miners is their carbon footprint. Runets said BitRiver uses more than 90% green power as it builds data centres in regions with electricity surpluses and renewable energy sources nearby.Russia accounts for about 7% of the world’s bitcoin mining, according to Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of Cryptoeconomics, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain, a figure that does not include grey-market players and those illegally connecting to power grids.Kazakhstan is responsible for a similar figure, while China is the market leader.",Reuters

Even at a time of heightened political polarization, Republicans and Democrats can agree on one thing: They generally don't like Mitch McConnell very much.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-mcconnell/between-trump-and-a-hard-place-senates-mcconnell-faces-bipartisan-unpopularity-poll-idUSKBN2B12LS,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Even at a time of heightened political polarization, Republicans and Democrats can agree on one thing: They generally don’t like Mitch McConnell very much.The 79-year-old Senate Republican leader, long known as the “Grim Reaper” for killing off numerous Democratic initiatives, ranked dead last among fellow Republicans in an Ipsos poll conducted for Reuters.All told, 57% of Americans expressed an unfavorable view of McConnell, including 29% who had a “very” unfavorable view of the Kentucky Republican. That included 49% of Republicans and 67% of Democrats, who were among 1,005 U.S. adults polled online March 3-4.McConnell, who entered the Senate in 1985 and served as Senate majority leader from 2015 until two months ago, has played a vital role in numerous Republican initiatives, including the cementing of a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court.He was re-elected to a seventh term last November, with a victory margin of nearly 20 percentage points.Asked to comment on the polling data, a senior Senate Republican aide pointed to McConnell’s strong re-election last year and his record-long term as Senate Republican leader, a position he has held since 2007 without opposition.Most recently, he found himself at odds with Donald Trump after excoriating the former president on the Senate floor for his role in sparking the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.Despite his bipartisan lack of popularity, McConnell was still viewed favorably by 28% of Republicans and 19% of Democrats.But those numbers still left him well behind other Republican figures.Among other current Republican leaders, Trump remained the most popular among members of his own party: 74% of Republicans said they had a favorable view of the former president, while 24% said they had an unfavorable view.Sixty-nine percent of Republicans said they had a favorable view of former Vice President Mike Pence, 55% said they had a similar view of Republican Senator Ted Cruz and 23% had a favorable view of hard-right U.S. House Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.The data has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 4 percentage points.",Reuters

792,House Republicans may follow Democrats in rebooting shamed 'earmarks' game,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-republicans-earmarks/house-republicans-may-follow-democrats-in-rebooting-shamed-earmarks-game-idUSKBN2B2094,"(Reuters) - House Republicans are weighing whether to join Democrats in getting back into “earmarks” - the practice of loading spending bills with legislators’ pet projects - and a decision is expected this week, two sources familiar with the process said .The sources said House Republicans deliberated on the issue twice this week, and sentiment is growing toward embracing earmarks roughly a decade after the party decided to scrap the long-standing practice amid a raft of high-profile controversies. Democrats who control the House agreed to bring back earmarks this year.A move to participate in earmarks will draw criticism from the conservative wing of the Republican Party, which has long criticized the practice as wasteful. It may also signal that Republicans are willing to negotiate on U.S. President Joe Biden’s next major agenda item: a massive infrastructure package.Earmarks are considered legislative “sweeteners” that Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, can use to dissuade its members from defecting on major bills and attract votes from Republicans who otherwise would reject the measure.If Republicans agree to participate in earmarks, they are signaling they could be engaged on an infrastructure bill and may be willing to trade support if it means getting funding for popular projects in their districts.“It would certainly suggest members are preparing for talks around the budget and infrastructure,” said a source familiar with the discussions.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s office did not return calls and emails on Tuesday seeking comment.Earmarks became a hot campaign issue in the early 2000s after a long string of scandals in which lawmakers from both parties secured earmarks to enrich themselves.In 2005, Senator Ted Stevens inserted an earmark to build a $223 million bridge to connect Gravina Island in his home state of Alaska - population 50 - to the mainland. Quickly nicknamed the “bridge to nowhere,” it became a lightning rod for critics.Republican Congressman Duke Cunningham of California resigned and pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from military contractors for steering business their way, using his positions on military committees to insert earmarks. In 2006, Cunningham was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison for accepting $2.4 million in bribes.When Republicans took control of the House in 2011, they banned the practice. Urged by President Barack Obama, the Democratic Senate soon followed suit. Earmarks have been gone since.Democratic lawmakers announced earlier year that they were bringing back the practice, hoping it could solve a few issues, such as keeping their narrow majorities together on big votes, boosting vulnerable members’ reelection chances in 2022 and perhaps attracting Republican support.",Reuters

Independence Holdings Corp priced a $435 million IPO on Monday, having increased the number of units sold due to investor demand.SPACs are shell companies that raise funds from investors to take a private company public.Pulling in extra cash and fully exercising the greenshoe, a share allotment potentially sold in the days after an IPO prices, McLaughlin told Reuters on Tuesday, will allow Independence to target larger fintech companies, beyond the $5 billion maximum size previously considered.He added a deal involving a company that processes payments between businesses, or one providing financial management services, would be likely for Independence.“We provide an incredibly attractive option for a company as we’ve successfully taken many companies through this complex process, so we can give comfort to founders and investors along the way,” McLaughlin said.Despite heightened investor interest in cryptocurrencies, McLaughlin said Independence wouldn’t be investing in a firm in that industry because most businesses are still too early in their development.He added it was highly unlikely that Independence would end up merging with a client of his investment bank.",Reuters

The parks were closed a year ago due to the COVID-19 pandemic.California officials set guidelines that would allow for theme parks in the state to reopen as soon as April 1. Chapek said it would take a few weeks to call back 10,000 furloughed employees to its two theme parks at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim and train them in new virus safety procedures.In addition, Disney might be able to resume some cruise ship operations in the fall, Chapek said.Disney was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic as theme parks and movie theaters were forced to shut down, but it has impressed Wall Street with the growth of Disney+, which debuted in November 2019.The company is hoping for a comeback at cinemas this year. It currently is holding firm to plans to release Marvel movie “Black Widow” in movie theaters on May 7, Chapek said.Asked if he might replace Kathleen Kennedy, president of “Star Wars” studio Lucasfilm, Chapek said he looked forward to her running that unit “for many years to come.” Some fans disliked the storylines of recent “Star Wars” movies and have argued for a new leader.The company also aims to reinstate dividend payments, which were suspended during the pandemic, “at some point” in the future, Chapek said.Chapek and nine others were re-elected to the company’s board of directors, according to preliminary vote tallies announced at the meeting, which was held online. They include Executive Chairman Bob Iger, who previously said he will retire from Disney at the end of 2021.In an advisory vote, 68% of ballots cast supported Disney executives’ compensation.The company’s shares, which hit a record high of $203 on Monday, were down 2.9% at $196.04 on Tuesday afternoon.",Reuters

The deal requires Facebook to implement several security commitments and maintain them for five years with external oversight.Alsup said in the November order that Facebook could oppose class counsel’s fee request, noting that since the relief is injunctive, the fee “will not detract from plaintiffs’ recovery.” He had ruled the year prior that users could sue as a group to seek better security but not monetary damages.In a motion for attorneys’ fees filed last month, lawyers for the class said the outcome “leaves an historic impact on Facebook’s security measures, in large part due to Class Counsel’s litigation and mediation efforts and strategies.”The lawyers requested $10.7 million in attorneys’ fees, an award that includes a multiplier of 1.253 on top of their proposed lodestar fees of $8.5 million.They also sought about $1.2 million in litigation costs, a $15,000 reserve for expert costs to monitor compliance, and a $5,000 service award for named plaintiff Stephen Adkins.The social media company, while noting the “valuable relief” contained in the settlement, in the Monday filing asked Judge Alsup to “reduce Class Counsel’s lodestar, decline the requested multiplier, and limit recoverable costs.”Class counsel “racked up a very sizeable bill pursuing damages theories that conferred no benefit on the Class,” Facebook said in the filing. “And Class Counsel now asks that this bill be paid without scrutiny, refusing to provide project-level or even chronological time records.”On top of the “documentation deficiencies,” the “high-level, block-billed figures they have submitted reveal that the matter was not handled efficiently,” Facebook said.The company pointed to “top-heavy staffing” that it said creates an hourly rate that is 35.8% higher than the average award in other data breach deals.The company’s lawyers at Latham said the court should reject the request for a “2.1 million bonus,” referring to the proposed lodestar multiplier. Facebook also called the $1.2 million in costs “bloated with legally unrecoverable costs,” including “expert fees for excluded and irrelevant experts and extravagant travel.”The litigation stemmed from a September 2018 breach that affected the personal information of about 29 million people, in which hackers exploited vulnerabilities in Facebook’s software that allowed them to generate access tokens that could be used to compromise users’ accounts.Judge Alsup is slated to hold a hearing on April 8 on the motions for attorneys fees and final approval of the settlement.The case is Adkins v.

It did not identify potential customers then, but one of the sources said it was hoping Tesla would buy the batteries.In September, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced an ambitious plan to develop new cells in-house, prompting suppliers like LG and Panasonic to embrace the unproven technology or face risks of losing a major customer for the longer term.The Korean supplier, a unit of LG Chem, has made samples for the so-called 4680 large-format cylindrical cells, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. It faces technological hurdles and the challenge of scaling up production, people familiar with the matter said.“LG plans to produce 4680 cells at its new U.S. factory. They plan to build a new 4680 cell line to supply Tesla’s Giga Berlin in Europe,” one of the sources said, adding Spain is one of candidate for the European plant.One of the sources said LG has never mass produced such large-format cylindrical cells, although increasing battery capacity is the correct call. “Tesla is a major customer, and LG can take risks,” another source said.He said LG has not yet secured orders from Tesla for the 4680 cells, still under development. For now, Tesla is sharply boosting orders for 2170 cells used in the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made in China, the source said.LG declined to comment, and Tesla officials could not be reached for comment.Tesla’s September plan to develop the new 4680 battery cells is meant to reduce production costs, improve battery performance and increase driving range. This would help with Tesla’s push to boost electric vehicle production significantly around the world.Tesla is running a pilot factory for the new battery cells in California, and preparing to build those cells at newer plants in Texas and Germany.Musk said recently Tesla is in talks with battery suppliers about developing 4680 batteries. He said Tesla will use the current cells for at least a few years, but will “retire” those cells over time.LG currently supplies smaller cells to Tesla in China, as does Chinese battery maker CATL. Panasonic has partnered with Tesla in a $5 billion battery “gigafactory” near Reno, Nevada.LG currently has a $2.3 billion joint venture with General Motors Co in Lordstown, Ohio, to make pouch-type electric vehicle batteries for future GM electric vehicles.GM said separately it is considering building a second U.S. battery factory with LG.The unusually candid comments from LG and GM came after another Korean battery supplier, SK Innovation, hopes the White House would overturn a recent U.S. trade ruling favoring LG, saying it threatens to disrupt battery supplies to Ford Motor and Volkswagen.Tesla rival Lucid Motors, which has a multi-year supply deal with LG Chem, and is considering whether to make its own cells in house, said it is interested in different cell formats, Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson earlier told Reuters.Panasonic plans to start a test line for 4680 cells in Japan in the business year beginning April 1, according to a person familiar with the matter. The two companies have not said if they plan to collaborate on production of the 4680 cells.Tesla may need to push out the timeframe for mass production, or work with partners at its newer plants in order to get cell production up and running quickly, said Caspar Rawles, an analyst at researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.",Reuters

Bitcoin mania has fuelled a surge in fundraising by Chinese companies seeking to expand their cryptocurrency operations or move into the red-hot sector.

Regulatory approval would represent a landmark victory for cryptocurrency advocates seeking mainstream endorsement.“Everyone can feel this euphoric atmosphere in the market, and Coinbase’s listing would lift the mood further,” said Jiang Changhao, co-founder and chief technology officer of Beijing-based Cobo a crypto custodian and wallet service provider.Cobo plans to launch a new round of venture capital funding this month to finance international expansion, aiming for tens of millions of dollars because, Jiang said, “the market is bullish and our business is growing very, very rapidly.”Kenetic Capital’s Chu said official backing for blockchain, and the use of the technology in major initiatives by giants like Ping An and Ant Financial, were a factor in the number of high quality blockchain and crypto projects in China.But the recent price surge had “poured napalm” on to competition in the sector, he said.Still, the entry of some Chinese firms into the crypto space has raised investor eyebrows.Last month, short-sellers Hindenburg Research and Culper Research alleged Chinese blockchain firm SOS Ltd, had made false claims about its cryptocurrency business, allegations SOS said were “distorted, misleading and unsubstantiated”.Guo of Univest Securities said the market has zero-tolerance toward cheating, but there’s nothing improper about Chinese companies jumping on to the bitcoin bandwagon.“If people don’t point figure at (Tesla founder) Elon Musk for endorsing bitcoin, what’s wrong with Chinese companies embracing it?”",Reuters

Retail often doesn’t sell as fast as the institutions, so the correction could last longer than for other tech stocks.”The tech-heavy Nasdaq index has declined more than 10.5% over the last three weeks. Tesla’s shares fell as much as 6.5% on Monday, while peers Nio Inc and Li Auto closed down 7.6% and 5.0% respectively.The broader auto industry has been pressured by a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has caused a major delay in manufacturing activities and forced many companies to scale down production.In late February, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said the company’s Fremont, California plant was shut down for two days due to “parts shortages”.The weeks-long selloff has reduced Musk’s wealth by more than $49 billion as of Friday, according to Reuters calculations.",Reuters

Based on their New York market capitalisation on Monday, proceeds could reach $5 billion.The companies have been working with advisors on the sales which could begin as early as mid-year, said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.Li Auto, Nio and Xpeng - which have raised $14.7 billion in U.S. markets since 2018 - declined to comment. U.S.-listed shares of the three automakers rose between 3.7% and 5.3% in early deals.The plans come as the trio increase capital raising efforts to fund technology development and expand sales networks, to better compete in the world’s biggest EV market where U.S. peer Tesla Inc is boosting sales of its China-made vehicles.This year is set to be crucial for EV makers to seize market share as the industry expects China sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) to jump almost 40% from last year to 1.8 million units.“Despite much richer financial resources now compared with a year ago, EV start-ups still need to invest heavily in next-generation technology,” said analyst Shi Ji at Haitong International. “Exploring a secondary listing much closer to their home market, if any, is a good move.”Selling shares in Hong Kong would also add the trio to a slew of New York-listed Chinese firms seeking a presence on more local exchanges amid Sino-U.S. political tension.The rising number of such listings “has enhanced the status of Hong Kong’s capital markets globally, and also helped issuers reach higher valuations and raise more capital,” said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset.Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.Li Auto and Xpeng went public in the United States mid-last year so will likely apply in Hong Kong for a dual primary listing, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter.As per Hong Kong’s dual primary listing rules, firms are subject to full bourse requirements in Hong Kong and a second exchange, but are not bound by the two-year condition.Xpeng is also considering a third listing on Shanghai’s STAR Market for new-economy firms, said two other people.“In the long run, it’s helpful for consumer-focused companies like us to connect with domestic capital markets and domestic investors,” Xpeng President Brian Gu told Reuters last week, declining to comment on any Hong Kong listing plan.“This is the direction we should pay attention to.”China’s government has heavily promoted NEVs - such as battery-powered, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars - in response to chronic air pollution, spurring interest from technology companies and investors alike.Last month, Reuters reported telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd plans to market EVs as early as this year.China forecasts NEVs will make up 20% of its annual auto sales by 2025 from around 5% in 2020.Domestic vehicle deliveries last year totalled 32,624 by Li Auto, 43,728 by Nio and 27,041 by Xpeng.

But NASA announced in January that the target date had slipped to April 20.The schedule was adjusted again on the basis of available flight times to the space station, driven by orbital mechanics, that would keep the astronauts’ need for sleep shifting to a minimum, NASA spokesman Dan Huot said on Monday.The flight marks only the second full-fledged space station crew-rotation mission launched aboard a private company’s spacecraft - a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket tipped with the Crew Dragon capsule it will carry into orbit.The four-member SpaceX Crew-2 consists of two NASA astronauts, mission commander Shane Kimbrough and pilot Megan McArthur, along with Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide and fellow mission specialist Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency.After docking with the space station, they will join the four SpaceX Crew-1 astronauts who arrived in November, and cosmonauts carried to the orbiting outpost aboard a Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft.The newly arrived Crew-2 are to remain in orbit six months, while Crew-1 is due to return to earth by early May.McArthur will become the second person from her family to ride a Crew Dragon into space.

The Senate version eliminated or pared back some provisions included in the House bill, which had increased the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and extended expanded jobless assistance through Aug. 29.Now that it has passed the Senate, it must be approved again by the House before it can make its way to Biden’s desk and be signed into law.Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol that the timing of a vote on the House floor “depends on when we get the paper from the Senate.”“We’d take it up Wednesday morning at the latest,” she said.Like the Senate, Democrats hold a very narrow majority in the chamber, meaning they cannot withstand many votes against the bill.The first version of the bill passed in the House without a single Republican vote. Two moderate Democrats joined Republicans in voting against that version.

A spokesman for her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But Representative Pramila Jayapal, head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters she thought members of the group would back the legislation, which she described as “phenomenal” and in keeping with most of its members’ priorities.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised the legislation at a news conference, saying that while there were some changes on the margins, it represented the “core” of what Biden originally proposed.",Reuters

819,"How Toyota thrives when the chips are down
Toyota may have pioneered the just-in-time manufacturing strategy but when it comes to chips, its decision to stockpile what have become key components in cars goes back a decade to the Fukushima disaster.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-fukushima-anniversary-toyota-in/how-toyota-thrives-when-the-chips-are-down-idUSKBN2B1005,"(Reuters) - Toyota may have pioneered the just-in-time manufacturing strategy but when it comes to chips, its decision to stockpile what have become key components in cars goes back a decade to the Fukushima disaster.After the catastrophe severed Toyota’s supply chains on March 11, 2011, the world’s biggest automaker realised the lead-time for semiconductors was way too long to cope with devastating shocks such as natural disasters.That’s why Toyota came up with a business continuity plan (BCP) that required suppliers to stockpile anywhere from two to six months’ worth of chips for the Japanese carmaker, depending on the time it takes from order to delivery, four sources said.And that’s why Toyota has so far been largely unscathed by a global shortage of semiconductors following a surge in demand for electrical goods under coronavirus lockdowns that has forced many rival automakers to suspend production, the sources said.“Toyota was, as far as we can tell, the only automaker properly equipped to deal with chip shortages,” said a person familiar with Harman International, which specialises in car audio systems, displays and driver assistance technology.Two of the sources who spoke to Reuters are Toyota engineers and the others are at companies involved in the chip business.Toyota surprised rivals and investors last month when it said its output would not be disrupted significantly by chip shortages even as Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Honda and Stellantis, among others, have been forced to slow or suspend some production.Toyota, meanwhile, has raised its vehicle output for the fiscal year ending this month and jacked up its full-year earnings forecast by 54%.The source familiar with Harman said the company, part of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics, was experiencing shortages of central processing units (CPUs) and power management integrated circuits as early as November last year.While Harman doesn’t make chips, because of its continuity deal with Toyota, it was obliged to prioritise the carmaker and ensure it had enough semiconductors to maintain supplies of its digital systems for four months, or more, the source said.The chips in especially short supply now are microcontroller units (MCUs) which control an array of functions such as braking, acceleration, steering, ignition, combustion, tire pressure gauges and rain sensors, the four sources told Reuters.However, Toyota changed the way it buys MCUs and other microchips after the 2011 earthquake, which caused a tsunami that killed more than 22,000 people and triggered a deadly meltdown at Fukushima’s nuclear power plant.In the aftermath of the quake, Toyota estimated its procurement of more than 1,200 parts and materials might be affected and it drew up a list of 500 priority items that would need secure supply in the future, including semiconductors made by key Japanese chip supplier Renesas Electronics.The repercussions of the disaster were so severe it took six months for Toyota to get production outside Japan back to normal levels, having done so at home two months earlier.It was a big shock to Toyota’s just-in-time system because a smooth flow of components from suppliers to factories to assembly lines - as well as lean inventories - were central to its emergence as an industry leader for efficiency and quality.At a time when supply chain risk is now front and centre in almost every industry, the move shows how Toyota was ready to throw out its own rule book when it came to semiconductors - and is reaping the rewards.A Toyota spokesman said one of the goals of its lean inventories strategy was to become sensitive to inefficiencies and risks in supply chains, identify the most potentially damaging bottlenecks and figure out how to avoid them.“The BCP for us was a classic lean solution,” he said.Toyota pays for its stockpiling arrangement with chip suppliers by returning a portion of the cost cuts it demands from them each year during the life cycle of any car model under so-called annual cost-down programmes, the sources said.Inventories of MCU chips - which often combine multiple technologies, CPUs, flash memory and other devices - are held for Toyota by parts suppliers such as Denso, which is partially owned by Toyota Group, chip makers like Renesas and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and chip traders.While there are different kinds of MCUs, those in short supply now are not cutting-edge chips but more mainstream ones with semiconductor nodes ranging from 28 to 40 nanometres, the sources said.Toyota’s continuity plans for chips has also cushioned it from the impact of natural disasters exacerbated by climate change, such as fiercer typhoons and rain storms which often cause floods and landslides across Japan, including the southern Kyushu region manufacturing hub where Renesas also makes chips.One of the sources involved in semiconductor supply, said Toyota and its affiliates had become “extra risk averse and sensitive” to the impact of climate change. But natural disasters and are not the only threat on the horizon.Automakers fear there will be more disruptions to chip supplies because of rising demand as cars become more digital and electric, as well as fierce rivalry for chips from makers of smart phones to computers to aircraft to industrial robots.The sources said Toyota has another advantage over some rivals when it comes to chips thanks to its long-standing policy of ensuring it understands all the technology used in its cars, rather than relying on suppliers to provide “black boxes”.“This basic approach sets us apart,” said one of the sources, a Toyota engineer.“From what causes flaws in semiconductors to gory details about production processes like what gases and chemicals you use to make the process work, we understand the technology inside and out. It’s a different level of knowledge that you can’t simply gain if you’re just buying those technologies.”‘LOSING OUR GRIP?’There has been an explosion in the use of semiconductors and digital technologies by automakers this century thanks to the rise of hybrid and fully electric vehicles, as well as autonomous driving and connected car functions.Those innovations require even more computing power and use in part a new category of semiconductors called system on a chip, or SoC, which roughly speaking combines multiple CPUs on one logic board.The technology is so new and specialised many carmakers have left it to big parts suppliers to manage the risks.In keeping with its no black box approach, however, Toyota developed a deep in-house understanding of semiconductors to prepare for the launch of its successful Prius hybrid in 1997.Years before, it poached engineering talent from the chip industry and opened a semiconductor plant in 1989 to help design and manufacture MCUs used to control Prius powertrain systems.Toyota designed and manufactured its own MCUs and other chips for three decades until it transferred its chip-making plant to Denso in 2019 to consolidate the supplier’s operations.The four sources said Toyota’s early drive to develop a deep understanding of semiconductor design and manufacturing processes was a major reason why it has managed to avoid being hit by the shortages, in addition to its continuity contracts.Two of the sources, however, said they were worried the Denso deal might indicate that Toyota was finally willing to ditch its no black box approach, even though the supplier is part of the broader Toyota Group.“We were okay this time, but who knows what awaits us in the future?” one source said. “We may be losing our grip on technology in the name of technological development efficiency.”",Reuters

ARK Investment Management Chief Executive Cathie Wood defended her strategy on Monday, arguing the recent outperformance of value and economically sensitive cyclical sectors will make for a stronger bull market and help her funds in the longer term.

In an underlying sense the bull market is strengthening and that will play to our benefit over the longer term,” Wood told CNBC in an interview.Wood shot to prominence over the last year with outsized bets on companies such as Tesla and Square that surged during the pandemic, attracting $14.84 billion in inflows over the past 12 months, according to Lipper data.But technology stocks have faltered in recent weeks, as rising bond yields and expectations of an economic rebound spur a powerful rotation out of the “stay-at-home” names that drove markets higher for most of 2020 and into companies that would most benefit from an economic reopening.The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Monday confirmed a correction as it closed 10% lower than its record close in February. [.N]Wood noted that the rapid increase in interest rates has “shaken a lot of investors” and helped trigger a rotation into value sectors which was has been “part of the reason for Ark’s setbacks.”The stock picker also pointed to Invitae Corp, another holding which is getting “hammered” despite being “one of the most important companies in the genomic revolution.” Shares of the ETF’s top holding, Tesla Motors, fell 5.8% on Monday and are off more than 20% this year.“We’re becoming more and more optimistic about our portfolios in the selloff,” Wood said.The Ark ETF lost 5.8% on Monday and is 29.6% below its record close of Feb. 12.",Reuters

The stock was up as much as 53% at the session high.Other stocks favored by retail investors on forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets also rallied. Some market watchers cited the U.S. Senate’s passage of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill including $1,400 direct payments to Americans.“Maybe there’s a thought that if people are going to get a lot of money in their stimulus checks, that some of it’s going into the stock market,” said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. “Some of it might go into those same names that we saw in late January, those message board Reddit-type stocks.”Retail investors surveyed by Deutsche Bank last month said they would put more than a third of their stimulus checks into the stock market, which could represent inflows of around $170 billion, the bank said in a research note.Retail buying of stocks and options has been among the factors driving markets higher over the past year, analysts said. Some 53% of respondents in the Deutsche Bank survey said they invested some funds from past stimulus checks in the stock market.Other stocks popular on Reddit also soared, with AMC Entertainment up 15.4%, headphone maker Koss Corp climbing 27.5% and Rocket Companies up 3.0%.The U.S. government should be able to start delivering $1,400 checks almost immediately once the aid bill is finalized and President Joe Biden signs it, tax experts say.GameStop’s latest rally followed several wild swings in the share price from January. GameStop has become one of the hottest and most visible “meme stocks” followed on social media sites.Cohen, a major shareholder who has pushed Gametop’s move away from its brick-and-mortar model, joined the board in January shortly before a social media frenzy drove a meteoric rise in which GameStop shares surged more than 1,600%.Hedge funds that had bet against the stock were forced to unwind their short positions, a situation known as a “short squeeze.” GameStop pared most of those gains the following month.Some analysts believe another short squeeze may be adding fuel to the stock’s recent gains. Short interest in GameStop was valued at $1.9 billion, or 25.38% of the stock’s float on Monday, compared to 32.56% about a week ago, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.Over the past week, short bets worth $538 million were covered, Dusaniwsky said.“Shorts will continue to be squeezed out of their positions as GME’s stock price continues to trend upwards,” Dusaniwsky said in an email.Recently, Cohen posted a cryptic tweet of an ice-cream cone, which some analysts viewed as a possible trigger for GameStop’s most recent rally.Cohen’s RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop in January, giving Cohen seats on the company’s board.GameStop said its Strategic Planning and Capital committee will help drive the latest e-commerce push. Along with Cohen, the committee will include Alan Attal, a Chewy alumni who joined the board as part of the RC Ventures settlement, and another board member Kurt Wolf.GameStop’s sales through brick-and-mortar stores are under increasing pressure, as more customers gravitate toward digital downloads of console games.",Reuters

Biden became president on Jan. 20.It was the last of three petitions filed at the Supreme Court near the end of Trump’s presidency that the justices declined to take up. The court on Feb. 22 turned away Trump’s other two appeals - a second Wisconsin challenge and one relating to voting in Pennsylvania, another pivotal state Trump lost. Lower courts previously had ruled against Trump in those three cases.It already was clear that the high court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump, had no intention to intervene in the cases and others filed by his allies because it did not act before Congress on Jan. 6 certified Biden’s victory. That formal certification was interrupted when a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol.In the Wisconsin case, Trump sued two days after the state had certified its election results. He challenged several Wisconsin election policies including one allowing the use of drop boxes for absentee ballots during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both a federal judge and the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the claims, noting in part that Trump had waited too long to sue.Courts around the country rejected the cases brought by Trump and his allies, sometimes in colorful terms. A judge put it this way in November in rejecting a Trump challenge in Pennsylvania: “This claim, like Frankenstein’s Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together.”Trump has made - and continues to make - false claims that the Nov. 3 presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and irregularities. Republicans are now seizing on those same unsubstantiated allegations in an effort to impose new voting restrictions in numerous states.The Supreme Court on Monday also turned away another election-related case filed by Trump ally Lin Wood, who had asked the justices to block the Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections in Georgia.

830,U.S. Supreme Court rejects case over 'qualified immunity' for police,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-qualifiedimmunity/u-s-supreme-court-rejects-case-over-qualified-immunity-for-police-idUSKBN2B01L6,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped a chance to review the scope of a legal defense called qualified immunity that increasingly has been used to shield police accused of excessive force, turning away an appeal by a Cleveland man who sued after being roughed up by police while trying to enter his own home.The justices declined to hear the appeal by Shase Howse, who said he was slammed to the ground outside the house where he lived with his mother in a poor and mostly Black neighborhood, struck in the back of the neck and jailed after police deemed his actions suspicious. Howse, who was 20 at the time, is Black. The police involved in the 2016 incident are white.Qualified immunity protects police officers and other types of government officials from civil litigation in certain circumstances, allowing lawsuits only when an individual’s “clearly established” statutory or constitutional rights have been violated.Police use of force has been closely scrutinized following the May 2020 death of a Black man named George Floyd after a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck.The U.S. House of Representatives last Wednesday passed policing reform legislation that among other provisions would eliminate the qualified immunity defense for law enforcement. The legislation, supported by most Democrats and opposed by Republicans, faces an uphill battle in the Senate.Howse’s case was featured in a Reuters investigation into qualified immunity published in December. The investigation illustrated how the endorsement of this defense by courts has denied Black Americans recourse to justice under a law enacted 150 years ago specifically to protect them from abuses by state and local authorities in the post-Civil War years.Howse sued two police officers, Brian Middaugh and Thomas Hodous, accusing them of excessive force in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. The officers said they used only the force necessary to subdue Howse.The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020 granted the officers qualified immunity, ruling that no “clearly established” precedent showed that their actions were unlawful.In May 2020, a Reuters investigation revealed how qualified immunity, under the careful stewardship of the Supreme Court, has made it easier for police to kill or injure civilians with impunity by shielding them from lawsuits, even when courts determine police actually violated a person’s constitutional rights.Law enforcement professionals and some U.S. conservatives have argued that qualified immunity is essential for police to make quick decisions in dangerous situations without fear of lawsuits.In recent months, the Supreme Court has signaled a potential softening of its approach to qualified immunity. In two cases the justices allowed inmates to sue prison guards who had been granted immunity by lower courts from accusations that they violated the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.",Reuters
831,Biden's picks for key Justice Department posts face confirmation scrutiny,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-justice-preview/bidens-picks-for-key-justice-department-posts-face-confirmation-scrutiny-idUSKBN2B01IN,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In her first big civil rights case after law school, Vanita Gupta two decades ago challenged the wrongful drug convictions of dozens of Black residents of the Texas Panhandle city of Tulia, all of which hinged on faulty testimony by an undercover police officer with a checkered past.Gupta, then a junior lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, went toe to toe with the local prosecutor. But she nonetheless managed to charm him so much that he sent her friendly emails with his daily morning thoughts, other members of the defense team recalled.“We were saying it was prosecutorial misconduct, and misconduct by the sheriff’s department that should get all these folks out of prison ... and meanwhile he is sending her his inspiring morning email,” civil rights attorney Jennifer Klar, a friend of Gupta, said of the case.The governor of Texas eventually issued pardons for Gupta’s clients. Gupta is now President Joe Biden’s nominee to serve as associate U.S. attorney general, the Justice Department’s No. 3 job. Her powers of persuasion and ability to win over adversaries will be put to an important test this week.Gupta is set to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a confirmation hearing on Tuesday along with Lisa Monaco, Biden’s nominee for the Justice Department’s No. 2 job. Gupta has drawn opposition from some conservatives, including the Judicial Crisis Network activist group, and is believed to face a tougher confirmation battle than Monaco in the closely divided Senate.Law enforcement organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police and some high-profile conservatives including Grover Norquist have urged the Senate to confirm Gupta.The committee already has approved Biden’s nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland as attorney general. Garland awaits a confirmation vote on the Senate floor.‘HEART OF A LION’Monaco has drawn endorsements from figures in both parties, notably including Republican former attorneys general Alberto Gonzales and Michael Mukasey.“We come from different political perspectives,” said Cliff Stricklin, a Republican attorney and partner with the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, who said he got to know Monaco when they worked together on a team that prosecuted executives from the defunct energy company Enron.“She has the heart of a lion,” Stricklin said. “When I saw she was nominated for the position of deputy attorney general, I thought she is the perfect person at the perfect time for that role.”Gupta and Monaco are expected to face questions from senators on topics ranging from civil rights enforcement to how the Justice Department will protect against future attacks by domestic extremists.Gupta’s portfolio, if she wins Senate confirmation, would include supervising civil rights, antitrust, environmental and community policing matters.If confirmed as deputy attorney general, Monaco would oversee the Justice Department’s criminal and national security matters and play a vital role in formulating criminal justice policies. She would help oversee the department’s sprawling investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of former President Donald Trump’s supporters.Now with the law firm O’Melveny & Myers, Monaco served as former President Barack Obama’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser and has extensive experience as a prosecutor and attorney on national security matters.In addition to serving on the government’s multi-agency task force that focused on wrongdoing by Enron after its 2001 collapse, Monaco worked at the FBI advising its former director Robert Mueller and later served as assistant attorney general in the National Security Division from 2011 to 2013 under Obama.The road for Gupta may be rockier.As the former acting assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, Gupta oversaw high-profile investigations into systemic abuses by police departments in Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri. Former President Donald Trump’s Justice Department scuttled similar types of investigations into police misconduct.Gupta became a Trump critic when she served as head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights advocacy group.The Judicial Crisis Network recently starting running a television ad incorrectly claiming Gupta told Reuters in a article last June that she supports defunding police - a statement she did not make.Defending Democracy Together, an anti-Trump Republican group, has launched its own campaign to back Gupta’s nomination, running ads targeting senators seen as swing votes including centrist Democrat Joe Manchin, and launching a website called ConfirmingGupta.com.“The breadth of her support is quite deep and unique,” said Wade Henderson, who took over as interim head of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights after Gupta’s nomination. “She is a proven consensus-builder.”",Reuters
832,"Rush to bitcoin? Not so fast, say keepers of corporate coffers
When Elon Musk's Tesla became the biggest name to reveal it had added bitcoin to its coffers last month, many pundits were swift to call a corporate rush towards the booming cryptocurrency.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-bitcoin-treasury-insi/rush-to-bitcoin-not-so-fast-say-keepers-of-corporate-coffers-idUSKBN2B00FY,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Elon Musk’s Tesla became the biggest name to reveal it had added bitcoin to its coffers last month, many pundits were swift to call a corporate rush towards the booming cryptocurrency.Yet there’s unlikely to be a concerted crypto charge any time soon, say many finance executives and accountants loath to risk balance sheets and reputations on a highly volatile and unpredictable asset that confounds convention.“When I did my treasury exams, the thing we were told as number one objective is to guarantee security and liquidity of the balance sheet,” said Graham Robinson, a partner in international tax and treasury at PwC and adviser to the UK’s Association for Corporate Treasurers.“That is the fundamental problem with bitcoin, if those are the objectives for treasurers, then breaking them could get them in trouble.”Tesla Inc’s $1.5 billion bitcoin bet saw it join business software firm MicroStrategy Inc and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey’s payments company Square Inc in swapping some traditional cash reserves for the digital coin.Proponents of the cryptocurrency see it as a hedge against inflation at a time of unprecedented government stimulus, a falling dollar and record-low interest rates that make attractive high-yielding assets hard to find.While the moves have prompted more boardroom discussions though, headaches from bitcoin’s volatility to accounting for it and storing it are likely to preclude a big wave of companies holding large amounts on balance sheets in the short term, according to over a dozen financial officers, board members and accountants interviewed by Reuters.“It will take more than a small handful of disruptive companies investing in bitcoin to impact the narrative in boardrooms,” said Raul Fernandez, an entrepreneur and investor who sits on the audit committee of the board of chipmaker Broadcom Inc as well as other companies.“Larger global companies, I can’t see those conversations happening right now.”GRAPHIC: Betting on bitcoin -One problem could lie in the devil of the accounting detail in a bookkeeping industry that, like many others, is still taking stock of the nature of cryptocurrencies.The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards for U.S. corporations, does not have guidance specific to the accounting for cryptocurrencies. However, consistent with discussions among a separate U.S. trade body, companies apply existing FASB guidance on the accounting for “intangible assets”, which usually includes intellectual property, brand recognition or goodwill.Under these rules, companies other than investment firms or broker-dealers cannot book gains in the value of holdings should the price of bitcoin rise - but must write down their investment as an impairment charge if it falls.Furthermore, once a company writes down its holdings, it cannot record subsequent gains until it sells.By contrast, companies periodically reflect the impact of fluctuations in traditional currencies in their financial statements.The FASB has no immediate plans to review its treatment of bitcoin as the issue affects few of its constituents, according to a source familiar with the matter.“I don’t think it’s the best accounting so far,” said Robert Herz, a former FASB chairman. “I am hoping that if more mainstream companies get into bitcoin, the accounting standards board may revisit the accounting treatment.”Outside the United States, cryptocurrencies are usually treated as intangible assets too. But in contrast to guidance under the FASB rules, writedowns can be reversed in future years. In certain cases, companies can record bitcoin at market value. See EXPLAINER:Publicly listed companies together hold around $9 billion of bitcoin, data from the Bitcoin Treasuries website shows. Around 80% is held by Tesla and MicroStrategy, the latter with over $4.5 billion.Square, which allows users to buy and sell bitcoin, said last month it had added an additional $170 million of the virtual coin to its coffers.Of course, if the price of bitcoin rises, a company can always simply sell its holdings, thus realising some gains. Yet it is still a risky investment, given the cryptocurrency’s record of wild swings.In 2013, for example, bitcoin started at around $13 and spiked to over $1,000. In 2017, it went from about $1,000 to around $20,000. In early 2020, it sunk below $4,000. It fell more than 25% late last month only a week after hitting a record high above $58,000. It has now recovered part of its losses.About 5% of chief financial officers (CFOs) and senior finance leaders said they planned to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets in 2021, a survey of 77 executives by U.S. research firm Gartner found last month.Some 84% of respondents said they did not plan to ever hold it as a corporate asset, citing volatility as the top concern, followed by board risk aversion, slow adoption as a widespread method of payment and regulatory issues.“I think for the most part you will find companies will avoid that sort of thing,” said Jack McCullough, president of the CFO Leadership Council and a former CFO.“CFOs are likely to be very conservative in managing corporate treasuries. They’re happy sinking money into very safe places with low interest. Their job is to help grow the company through its operations, and the treasury needs to be safe and secure.”Cryptocurrency supporters, however, say the rationale for companies to buy bitcoin is clear, not least the decline of the dollar - the dominant reserve currency - which has fallen about 4.5% against a basket of major currencies in the past year.“The value of the dollar over time is getting weaker and weaker,” said Dave Sackett, CFO of ULVAC Technologies Inc, the U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese vacuum equipment maker, and an active cryptocurrency investor.“Bitcoin flips the script on that.”Sackett pitched ULVAC executives on investing in bitcoin last April, suggesting they take a chance and then cash out with potential gains. They passed on the opportunity, he said.Other potential headaches for executives include questions over how a company can safely hold a cryptocurrency, and how much it should disclose to shareholders about security precautions, said Tim Davis, principal in the financial and risk advisory practice at Deloitte & Touche, which advises firms on holding crypto on their balance sheets.High-profile thefts from exchanges have highlighted problems over safely storing digital assets. The loss of passwords for digital wallets is also a risk. Offline or “cold” storage is widely seen as the best defence against hackers but there are few, if any, regulatory standards.“Do you custody it yourself?” Davis said. “Do you have an exchange custody it? How much of it do you want to have in a hot wallet versus a cold wallet?”Ultimately, experts added, the expansion into bitcoin by companies without existing ties to the cryptocurrency market may depend on the willingness of financial executives to take on risk.“The general consensus among treasurers is that very few of them are going to follow this trend initially,” said Naresh Aggarwal at the UK’s Association for Corporate Treasurers.“As a treasurer, if I am right and the price doubles, the company may sell its holding and make a profit. Whilst the company may be worth more, it won’t be reflected in my compensation,” he added.“But if the price falls, I am pretty confident I will be fired. Why bother putting my neck on the line?”(This story fixes spelling in Robert Herz’s name)",Reuters

Part of solution, as it is for a range of daily necessities in Tokyo, has become the humble vending machine.Eager to conserve manpower and hospital resources, the government conducts just 40,000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests a day, a quarter of its capacity, restricting them to people who are quite symptomatic or have had a high chance of being infected.That’s led to the public to rely heavily on private clinics or buying PCR tests by other means.Vending machines selling test kits offer consumers the option of avoiding crowded clinics or having to wait for an appointment, said Hideki Takemura, director of the Laketown Takenoko Ear Nose and Throat Clinic which has set up seven machines in the greater Tokyo area.“Japan was conducting a ridiculously low number of PCR tests and as a result more and more people couldn’t tell whether they had a cold or the coronavirus,” Takemura told Reuters. “Without PCR tests, no diagnosis is possible and I really felt we had to do more so that people could be diagnosed early and isolate early.”Takemura said there was a huge response from the public when the machines were first deployed and some needed to be emptied of money twice a day.Demand has since ebbed somewhat as a third wave of cases subsided amid a state of emergency. New cases in Tokyo have averaged around 250 over the past seven days compared with several days of more than 2,000 in early January.Each vending machine holds about 60 testing kits which sell for 4,500 yen ($40). Customers then mail off a saliva sample for processing.“As a medical worker, I’d be very happy if the number of tests decrease along with cases,” Takemura said.Japan has about 4.1 million vending machines in operation, the most in the world per capita, according to a trade group.In addition to vending machines, PCR tests have become increasingly available to the public via sales at drugstores or over the internet.($1 = 108.3800 yen)",Reuters

Floyd was hired recently to “provide help as needed” on matters involving racketeering, including the Trump investigation and other cases, said the source, who has direct knowledge of the situation.The move bolsters the team investigating Trump as Willis prepares to issue subpoenas for evidence on whether the former president and his allies broke the law in their campaign to pressure state officials to reverse his Georgia election loss. Willis has said that her office would examine potential charges including “solicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering” among other possible violations.A representative for Trump did not respond to requests for comment.Floyd’s appointment signals that racketeering could feature prominently in the investigation. It’s an area of law where Willis has extensive experience - including a high-profile Atlanta case where she won racketeering convictions of 11 public educators for a scheme to cheat on standardized tests.The investigation of Trump focuses in part on his phone call to Georgia’s secretary of state, asking the secretary to “find” the votes needed to overturn Trump’s election loss, based on false voter-fraud claims.Willis - a Democrat who in January became the county’s first Black woman district attorney - will have to navigate a fraught political landscape. She faces pressure from Democrats in Atlanta and nationally to pursue an aggressive prosecution, along with scrutiny from Republicans in a state historically dominated by that party.Floyd declined to comment when asked about the appointment but spoke to Reuters about his past experiences working with Willis.In 2014, when Willis was an assistant district attorney in Atlanta, Floyd was brought in as a special prosecutor for the racketeering case that grew out of the schools cheating scandal.“It was very much a team effort,” Floyd said of working with Willis.The cheating case could provide clues to her strategy for investigating Trump, legal experts say, while stressing that the probe is still in its early stages.If she pursues racketeering charges, Willis will need to prove a pattern of corruption by Trump, alone or with his allies, aimed at overturning the election results to stay in power. While racketeering is typically pursued by prosecutors in cases involving such crimes as murder, kidnapping, and bribery, the Georgia statute defines racketeering more broadly to include false statements made to state officials.The federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was originally passed in 1970 to help tie Mafia bosses to the crimes of their underlings by allowing prosecutors to argue they conspired together in a “criminal enterprise.” Over the years, however, its reach has grown to include businesses and other organizations as enterprises subject to the law.Willis specifically listed racketeering and lying to public officials in detailing the possible crimes her office intended to investigate in a Feb. 10 letter to four Republican state officials, asking them to preserve records related to the case.“That letter was really a signal to the public that she was going after a number of possibilities,” said Clark Cunningham, a Georgia State University law professor.Georgia lawyers familiar with the state RICO law said Willis may be considering whether it would apply to alleged false statements made by Trump and his allies as they sought to influence state officials to reverse his election loss.“It’s not a stretch to see where she’s taking this,” said Cathy Cox, the dean of Mercer University’s law school in Macon, Georgia and a former Georgia secretary of state. “If Donald Trump engaged in two or more acts that involve false statements - that were made knowingly and willfully in an attempt to falsify material fact, like the election results - then you can piece together a violation of the racketeering act.”Racketeering, a felony in Georgia, can carry stiff penalties including up to 20 years in prison and a hefty fine. “There are not a lot of people who avoid serving prison time on a racketeering offense,” said Cox.‘FIND’ THE VOTESIn a Jan. 2 phone call, Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to “find” just enough votes to allow him to win. In the hour-long call, Trump repeated false voter-fraud claims, insisting he won Georgia by a landslide and that Democrat Joe Biden received thousands of votes from people who were out-of-state, unregistered, or dead. Trump made another phone call in late December to Georgia’s chief elections investigator, urging the official to “find the fraud.”On Dec. 5, Trump called the state’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to urge him to hold a special session of the legislature to overturn the election results. Three days later, Trump called Georgia’s Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, warning him not to interfere with a Texas lawsuit that challenged the election results in Georgia and other states.Carr stated publicly that he opposed the Texas lawsuit. The offices of Kemp and Carr did not respond to requests for comment for this story.Willis’ office has indicated it is also examining efforts to influence the election by Trump’s allies, including a November phone call made by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham to Raffensperger to discuss mail-in ballots; false election fraud claims made by Trump’s then personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in testimony at state legislative hearings; and the abrupt removal of Byung J. “BJay” Pak, a U.S. attorney in Georgia who angered Trump by not doing enough to investigate his unfounded fraud claims.Legal experts say prosecutors could use the pattern of false statements in a pressure campaign to build a RICO case, but that Willis would face the burden of proving Trump knew his fraud allegations were false. In a trial, Trump could argue that he did not deliberately break the law because he truly believed he had been cheated, said Kurt Kastorf, an Atlanta attorney and former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor.“Trump’s lawyers could reasonably point to portions of the call with the Secretary of State where Trump seems to be making clear that the reason they need to do something is because there is fraud in the election,” he said. “Prosecutors would need to respond with evidence that this asserted reason is insincere.”As an assistant district attorney in Atlanta, Willis employed the state’s racketeering statute in the complex test-cheating case - leading to a six-month trial, the longest in Georgia history.Willis led a team of prosecutors in laying out the case that educators had operated a criminal enterprise within the public school system in a conspiracy to cheat, winning convictions in April 2015. Willis and her team walked jurors through months of testimony in the intricate case, which accused 12 former teachers, principals and administrators of inflating scores on standardized tests to secure promotions and cash bonuses. Eleven were convicted; some got prison time.“I’ve worked on some pretty intense cases over the years,” said Floyd, the RICO expert. “But as far as duration and complexity, that would be hard to match.”As a private attorney, Floyd is widely respected in legal circles for his expertise and experience litigating complex RICO cases. In addition to the cheating case, he helped convict a former sheriff of Georgia’s DeKalb County for ordering the murder of his elected successor. Floyd successfully defended the conviction, which included racketeering offenses, all the way to Georgia’s Supreme Court.Anti-racketeering laws are a powerful tool for prosecutors, but building a successful case requires meeting a complex set of legal requirements, according to Floyd, who wrote the book, “RICO State by State: A Guide to Litigation Under the State Racketeering Statutes.”In 1985, he joined the Atlanta law firm Bondurant Mixson & Elmore LLP, where he still works. Prior to joining the firm, Floyd clerked for a federal judge where he was introduced to RICO cases. “I worked on a few of them there, and my interest grew,” Floyd said.",Reuters

847,"Game of drones: Chinese giant DJI hit by U.S. tensions, staff defections
Chinese drone giant DJI Technology Co Ltd built up such a successful U.S. business over the past decade that it almost drove all competitors out of the market.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tech-dji-insight/game-of-drones-chinese-giant-dji-hit-by-u-s-tensions-staff-defections-idUSKBN2AZ0PV,"SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Chinese drone giant DJI Technology Co Ltd built up such a successful U.S. business over the past decade that it almost drove all competitors out of the market.Yet its North American operations have been hit by internal ructions in recent weeks and months, with a raft of staff cuts and departures, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees.The loss of key managers, some of who have joined rivals, has compounded problems caused by U.S. government restrictions on Chinese companies, and raised the once-remote prospect of DJI’s dominance being eroded, said four of the people, including two senior executives who were at the company until late 2020.About a third of DJI’s 200-strong team in the region was laid off or resigned last year, from offices in Palo Alto, Burbank and New York, according to three former and one current employee.In February this year, DJI’s head of U.S. R&D left and the company laid off the remaining R&D staff, numbering roughly 10 people, at its flagship U.S. research centre in California’s Palo Alto, four people said.DJI, founded and run by billionaire Frank Wang, said it made the difficult decision to reduce staffing in Palo Alto to reflect the company’s “evolving needs”.“We thank the affected employees for their contributions and remain committed to our customers and partners,” it said, adding that its North American sales were growing strongly.“Despite misleading claims from competitors, our enterprise customers understand how DJI products provide robust data security. Despite gossip from anonymous sources, DJI is committed to serving the North American market.”It did not comment on the other U.S. staff departures that current and ex-employees spoke of, although it told Reuters last year its global structure was becoming “unwieldy to manage”.DJI, which has become a symbol of Chinese innovation since it was founded in 2006, is one of dozens of companies caught in the crossfire of trade and diplomatic hostilities between Washington and Beijing, like Huawei and Bytedance.Staff sources and competitors say the company’s brand reach, technical know-how, manufacturing might and sales force mean it won’t lose its crown anytime soon in the multi-billion-dollar U.S. and global markets for non-military drones.But a December order adding the company to the U.S. Commerce Department’s “Entity List” along with the closure of its R&D operation in California could affect its ability to serve the needs of U.S. customers, according to three former senior executives and two competitors.The Commerce Department listing, enacted over allegations including DJI enabled “high-technology surveillance”, prohibits the company from buying or using U.S. technology or components.The same month, Romeo Durscher, DJI’s U.S.-based head of public safety, who had played a central role in building the company’s business in providing drone technology to non-military U.S. government departments and agencies, left his job.Durscher, a former NASA project manager and an influential figure in the drone industry, now works at Swiss company Auterion, a competitor to DJI.He said he left DJI because he was disheartened by the staff cuts and what he described as internal power struggles between the U.S. team and its China headquarters. He added that the U.S. reorganisation complicated the task in dealing with the fallout from U.S.-China tensions and winning government business.“It’s not an easy decision to leave the market leader that’s really far ahead of everyone else,” said Durscher, who joined DJI in 2014. “But those internal battles were distracting from the real purpose and in 2020 it got worse ... we lost tremendous talent at DJI and that’s very unfortunate.”Privately held DJI doesn’t publish sales figures. The U.S. Department of Defense estimated the American non-military market was worth $4.2 billion last year. Consultancy DroneAnalyst said DJI controlled almost 90% of the consumer market in North America and over 70% of the industrial market.The December listing by the Commerce Department, and the prohibition on buying U.S. parts, may impact the firm’s mobile apps, web servers and some battery and imaging products, said David Benowitz, head of research at DroneAnalyst and a senior figure with DJI’s enterprise team, which works with industrial customers, in Shenzhen before he left last summer.DJI said in December that the ban would not affect U.S. customers’ ability to buy and use its products.The listing followed other official blows. In October, the U.S. Department of the Interior said it would only buy drones from companies okayed by the Department of Defense, which last August published a list of five approved drone suppliers to the federal government - four American and one French.DJI said there was no “broad-based U.S. government ban on purchasing DJI drones”.“Congress considered that approach last year and rejected it, because ... such a ban would be challenging for many companies and government bodies that rely on drones,” it added.‘WE’RE STILL PRIMITIVE’Benowitz said persisting U.S.-China tensions and the push by Washington to support DJI’s rivals could see the company’s North American market share decline. He added that, while the federal government comprised a relatively small part of DJI’s business, its restrictions could have a “chilling effect”, with other buyers worried about tougher measures in the future.“We’re at a point where there are too many market opportunities for one player to dominate,” he said.Yet he added alternatives to DJI were relative minnows, though both policy support and security concerns over Chinese drones had brought them growth in the last year. Competitors to DJI include France’s Parrot and California-based Skydio.Chris Roberts, CEO of Parrot Inc, Americas, said 2020 had been a significant year for the company in the United States, having been named an approved supplier by the Defense Department and won business from emergency services and security agencies.Skydio announced $170 million in D-round funding last week and said it had a valuation of over $1 billion.“DJI makes good hardware but we are still very early in the market, and very primitive compared to what ultimately should exist,” Skydio CEO Adam Bry told Reuters.When Durscher joined DJI back in 2014, the company’s Phantom series was transforming drones from a niche hobby to a mainstream gadget. He said he was particularly drawn by the chance to bring drones into the kit of fire and rescue departments.He said the technological advances of smaller rivals in the last year were tempting for some public-safety agencies, who might say “let’s go with this drone now so we don’t have to deal with the data security”.He added that change could come as government departments and companies looked to replace drone fleets that are nearing the end of their life cycles.A fleet is typically expected to last three to four years, according to Benowitz.Durscher and several other staff compared DJI’s internal rivalry over projects to “Game of Thrones”, the TV series where rival factions vie for power. He said this resulted in a rotating door of Shenzhen bosses, and that he reported to 12 different managers in his six years at the company.Durscher’s departure from DJI followed those of other key executives in North America last year, including director of business development Cynthia Huang.Huang, who now works with Durscher at Auterion, said she became increasingly frustrated because she felt DJI wasn’t able to meet all the growing demands of the enterprise market. Additionally, she said, job cuts over the past year added to the reasons she decided to leave. The losses in Palo Alto, Burbank and New York had followed cuts made to DJI’s global sales and marketing teams, which Reuters reported in August.“Some of the people that we lost in those layoffs, it didn’t make sense,” said Huang, who was hired in 2018 to take the lead in building DJI’s enterprise business in North America. “The continued exodus of talent was discouraging.”",Reuters

Large companies from carmaker Tesla Inc to business intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc have swapped billions of dollars in cash for bitcoin in recent months.
MAR 08 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-bitcoin-treasury-expl/explainer-bitcoin-on-your-balance-sheet-heres-what-you-need-to-know-idUSKBN2B00FP,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large companies from carmaker Tesla Inc to business intelligence firm MicroStrategy Inc have swapped billions of dollars in cash for bitcoin in recent months.Yet hurdles remain for the quick dawn of a wider trend of major corporations holding bitcoin, from the cryptocurrency’s volatility to reputational risk, financial chiefs and accountants told Reuters. Main story:Here are some of the key questions over cryptocurrency bookkeeping and tax:The bookkeeping rules used by U.S. companies make no specific reference to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.Under guidance from 2019 issued by the U.S. accounting trade body, companies account for bitcoin under rules for “intangible assets” such as intellectual property.Companies record the value of bitcoin at the time of purchase in their accounts. If the price rises, they cannot log those gains until they sell. Yet if the value of bitcoin drops, the company must write down the value of their holdings as an impairment charge.Outside the United States, where companies operate under a separate set of rules, crypto is accounted for differently.Companies that own digital coins for sale as part of their normal business hold them as inventories at cost price. Others, such as broker-traders, can hold such inventories at market value, said the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, which sets rules for most non-U.S. corporations.Other companies hold their cryptocurrencies as intangible assets, like in the United States. Yet they can reverse any writedowns back to original cost if the value of the coin rises again. In some other cases, companies that record crypto as intangible assets can gauge the value of their crypto holdings at market value.Most of the publicly listed companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets are specialist cryptocurrency or blockchain firms, according to Bitcoin Treasuries bitcointreasuries.org.But last month, Tesla became the highest-profile mainstream company to shift some of its coffers to bitcoin from cash, making a $1.5 billion bet on the digital currency.In a regulatory filing, it said the bitcoin would be accounted for as “indefinite-lived intangible assets”, warning it could face impairment charges if their price falls.MicroStrategy Inc, led by bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor, holds around 91,000 bitcoin. Its holdings are worth around $4.6 billion, according to a Reuters calculation.It analyses bitcoin prices on cryptocurrency exchanges each quarter, with any fall in the value of the asset after their purchase leading to an impairment charge, according to a securities filing last month.Payments firm Square Inc has also converted large chunks of its balance sheet into bitcoin, with boss Jack Dorsey promising to “double down” on its commitment to the cryptocurrency.Square says it will recognise any decreases in market prices below the original cost as an impairment charge but, in line with accounting standards, will not mark up the value if the price increases.In its most recent regulatory filings, Square goes into detail about some of the security and custody risks involving bitcoin. It listed losing access as an operational risk, with a hack or data loss potentially harming trust in the company.It also counted bitcoin volatility and impairment among its legal, regulatory and compliance risks.Cryptocurrencies are treated as property under federal U.S. tax rules.Companies can be liable for capital gains tax whenever they sell a cryptocurrency. The amount paid depends on how long they have held the coin and the market value at the time of the transaction.MicroStrategy warned in a filing to U.S. regulators last month that it could face a tax bill for any gains it made from selling bitcoin and that “such tax liability could be material”.Other major countries follow similar rules.In Britain, for example, the type of tax paid for trading digital currencies or accepting payment in crypto depends on who is involved in the business, according to the UK tax agency.Such activity will likely incur capital gains tax, corporation tax or other duties, it said.(This story refiles to correct typo in headline)",Reuters

The White House official, in a statement, said the administration was making “a whole of government response.”While Microsoft released a patch last week to shore up flaws in its email software, the remedy still leaves open a so-called back door that can allow access to compromised servers and perpetuating further attacks by others.“We can’t stress enough that patching and mitigation is not remediation if the servers have already been compromised, and it is essential that any organization with a vulnerable server take measures to determine if they were already targeted,” the White House official said.Already, a source told Reuters more than 20,000 U.S. organizations had been compromised by the hack, which Microsoft has blamed on China, although Beijing denies any role.The back channels for remote access can impact credit unions, town governments and small business, and have left U.S. officials scrambling to reach victims, with the FBI on Sunday urging them to contact the law enforcement agency.Those affected appear to host Web versions of Microsoft’s email program Outlook on their own machines instead of cloud providers, possibly sparing many major companies and federal government agencies, records from the investigation suggest.A Microsoft representative on Sunday said it was working with the government and others to help guide customers, and the company urged impacted clients to apply software updates as soon as possible.Neither the company nor the White House has specified the scale of the hack. Microsoft initially said it was limited, but the White House last week expressed concern about the potential for “a large number of victims.”So far, only a small percentage of infected networks have been compromised through the back door, the source previously told Reuters, but more attacks are expected.",Reuters

857,Civil rights groups urge companies to join fight against Georgia voting restrictions,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-georgia/civil-rights-groups-urge-companies-to-join-fight-against-georgia-voting-restrictions-idUSKBN2AX19A,"(Reuters) - Voting rights groups are calling on companies such as Coca-Cola Co and Delta Air Lines Inc to oppose efforts by Republican lawmakers in Georgia to enact sweeping new restrictions on voting access in the battleground state.The organizations, including the Black Voters Matter Fund, the New Georgia Project Action Fund and the Georgia NAACP, launched a campaign on social media and in local news outlets this week asking the corporations to take a stand against legislation they said aims to curb turnout from Democratic-leaning Black voters.Black voters were crucial to helping elect Democrat President Joe Biden in the November election and two Democratic senators in a January run-off in Georgia, a once unthinkable scenario in the traditionally Republican southern state.“Some of these companies have made beautiful statements for Black Lives Matter,” said Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group focused on increasing Black Americans’ voting access. “Yet here, in the moment where it matters most, they have been silent.”Republicans in Georgia and across the country are using former President Donald Trump’s false claims of voter fraud to back state-level voting changes they say are needed to restore election integrity.Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court this week to uphold voting restrictions in Arizona in a case that could further hobble the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits racial discrimination in voting.They also opposed an election reform bill passed on Wednesday by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives. The For the People Act, the most comprehensive voting bill since the 1965 act, faces long odds in the Senate, with Republicans saying it fails to do enough to combat fraud.In Georgia, likely one of the biggest battlegrounds in the 2022 elections with a U.S. Senate seat and the governor’s office on the ballot, Republican state lawmakers sponsoring the voting measures maintain they are meant to safeguard elections.A bill passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia House on Monday would restrict ballot drop boxes, tighten absentee voting requirements and limit early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches.Some voting rights groups have increased their focus on corporations based in Georgia after Popular Information, an online politics newsletter run by Judd Legum, a former aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton, cited campaign finance records popular.info/p/georgia showing the companies had donated around $7.4 million since 2018 to politicians sponsoring the voting legislation.The groups took out several full-page ads in local newspapers urging Delta, Coca-Cola, Southern Company, Home Depot Inc, United Parcel Service Inc and Aflac Inc to stop the donations and support federal voting rights reform.Albright said the groups will encourage Georgia residents to call the companies and that protests could be organized in front of their offices.In statements to Reuters, Coca-Cola, UPS, Delta, Home Depot and Aflac said they were committed to voter rights but did not provide specifics about their stance on the Georgia bills or their future political donations.Coca-Cola said it paused political donations in January, when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The company added that it supported efforts to “help facilitate a balanced approach” to the voting bills. Aflac also said it paused all political donations in January.Delta said it had not made any individual contributions to Georgia House or Senate candidates in 2020.UPS and Coca-Cola said they were working with local commerce chambers on voting rights issues. The Georgia Chamber of Commerce did not comment on ongoing talks, referring Reuters to a Feb. 16 statement in which the group said it believed it should be “easy to vote, hard to commit fraud.”Southern Company declined to comment.U.S. companies in general are becoming more reticent about the exposure that comes with political donations, said Donald Green, a political science professor at Columbia University.“This will give them yet another excuse to back away from that type of contribution,” Green said.Georgia’s Republican Party did not respond to a request for comment on voting rights groups’ efforts to enlist companies’ help in fighting the bills.The Georgia proposals have drawn scrutiny from More Than A Vote, a voter rights organization founded last year by NBA star LeBron James and other athletes to expand Black voter turnout and fight systemic racism in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.The group is kicking off a new campaign to fight efforts to restrict voting access. It will start by running a 30-second advertisement narrated by James during the televised NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta on Sunday.",Reuters

A U.S. agency investigating Facebook Inc for racial bias in hiring and promotions has designated the probe as ""systemic,"" attorneys for three job applicants and a manager who claim the company discriminated against them told Reuters on Friday.
MAR 06 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-workers-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-agency-probes-facebook-for-systemic-racial-bias-in-hiring-promotions-idUSKBN2AY006,"(Reuters) - A U.S. agency investigating Facebook Inc for racial bias in hiring and promotions has designated the probe as “systemic,” attorneys for three job applicants and a manager who claim the company discriminated against them told Reuters on Friday.A “systemic” probe means the agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, suspects company policies may be contributing to widespread discrimination.The EEOC typically resolves disputes through mediation or allowing complainants to sue employers. But agency officials designate a few cases “systemic,” enabling investigators to rope in specialists to analyze company data and potentially bring a broader lawsuit representing entire classes of workers.Facebook operations program manager Oscar Veneszee Jr. and two applicants denied jobs brought a charge last July to the EEOC, and a third rejected applicant joined the case in December. They have alleged Facebook discriminates against Black candidates and employees by relying on subjective evaluations and promoting problematic racial stereotypes.The designation of the EEOC’s probe has not been previously reported.The EEOC has not brought allegations against Facebook. Its investigation, which may last months more, may not result in findings of wrongdoing. The agency declined to comment.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to comment on the status of the probe or specific allegations but said that “it is essential to provide all employees with a respectful and safe working environment.”“We take any allegations of discrimination seriously and investigate every case,” he said.The EEOC brought in systemic investigators by last August and received detailed briefing papers from both sides over the last four months, said Peter Romer-Friedman, an attorney at Gupta Wessler representing Veneszee and the job candidates.Employment law firms Mehri & Skalet and Katz Marshall & Banks also are helping the workers.The EEOC’s Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Washington offices are involved, attorneys from the firms said.Facebook’s counsel, Covington & Burling, did not respond to a request for comment.Increasing racial and gender diversity has been a persistent challenge for the nation’s largest tech companies, which at times have blamed a shortage of qualified candidates from underrepresented groups. But tech workers have grown emboldened to publicly challenge that notion and allege in formal complaints that biased employment practices cause disparities.Romer-Friedman said he and his colleagues told the EEOC in a submission last month that one such Facebook policy is awarding employees bonuses of up to $5,000 when a candidate they refer is hired. Referred candidates tend to reflect the makeup of existing employees, disadvantaging Black professionals, he said.Facebook said about 3.9% of its U.S. employees as of last June were Black.David Lopez, a former EEOC general counsel now teaching at Rutgers University, said that systemic investigations are significant because of the additional resources involved. When they result in allegations of wrongdoing, multimillion-dollar settlements sometimes follow, he said, citing recent cases against Dollar General Corp and Walmart Inc.In the year ended last Sept. 30, 13 of the 93 EEOC merit lawsuits were systemic, according to agency data.Last December, the Justice Department accused Facebook of discriminating against U.S. workers broadly, saying it gave hiring preference to temporary workers such as H-1B visa holders.Alphabet Inc’s Google last month agreed to spend $3.8 million to settle U.S. government allegations that it underpaid women and unfairly passed over women and Asians for job openings.",Reuters

That may have spared many of the biggest companies and federal government agencies, the records suggest.The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment.Earlier on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the vulnerabilities found in Microsoft’s widely used Exchange servers were “significant,” and “could have far-reaching impacts.”“We’re concerned that there are a large number of victims,” Psaki said.Microsoft and the person working with the U.S. response blamed the initial wave of attacks on a Chinese government-backed actor. A Chinese government spokesman said the country was not behind the intrusions.What started as a controlled attack late last year against a few classic espionage targets grew last month to a widespread campaign. Security officials said that implied that unless China had changed tactics, a second group may have become involved.More attacks are expected from other hackers as the code used to take control of the mail servers spreads.The hackers have only used the back doors to re-enter and move around the infected networks in a small percentage of cases, probably less than 1 in 10, the person working with the government said.“A couple hundred guys are exploiting them as fast as they can,” stealing data and installing other ways to return later, he said.The initial avenue of attack was discovered by prominent Taiwanese cyber researcher Cheng-Da Tsai, who said he reported the flaw to Microsoft in January. He said in a blog post that he was investigating whether the information leaked.He did not respond to requests for further comment.",Reuters

The charges were brought in Manhattan federal court.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed related civil charges concerning the alleged pump-and-dump scheme.Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a statement: “As alleged, McAfee and Watson exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception.”Lawyers for McAfee could not immediately be identified. McAfee is being detained in Spain following his arrest there on tax evasion charges announced in October, the Justice Department said.Watson was arrested on Thursday night in Texas, the department added.Watson’s attorney Arnold Spencer said in a statement: “Jimmy Watson is a decorated veteran and former Navy Seal. He fought for other people’s rights and liberties, and he is entitled to and looks forward to his day in court to exercise some of those very rights.”Both also face civil charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which in October accused McAfee of concealing more than $23.1 million he made from boosting seven cryptocurrency offerings on Twitter.In the cryptocurrency cases, authorities said McAfee touted assets including Verge, Reddcoin and Dogecoin as part of a “Coin of the Day” or “Coin of the Week” tweet from around December 2017 through February 2018.Authorities said McAfee held himself up as an expert on cybersecurity and cryptocurrency through his tweets, speeches and his role as a CEO of a publicly traded cryptocurrency company. They also accused him of telling followers he had no stake in the coins, even as he touted how they “will change the world.”",Reuters

AT&T’s share price rose 1.7% the next day.The allegations would represent a violation of regulation that prohibits firms from disclosing significant information to securities analysts without sharing it with the public, the SEC said.

I look forward to the committee and the Senate approving her nomination,” said Cassidy, in his introduction of Young to a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmation hearing.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats, including the Congressional Black Caucus, say that Young should replace Tanden as Biden’s nominee for director of the Office of Budget and Management.Tanden withdrew her nomination this week, after senators from both parties threatened not to vote for her because of her critical comments on Twitter.Young, who was the first Black woman to serve as the staff director for Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, could become the first Black woman to head the OMB.Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee wrote to Biden on Thursday urging him to nominate Young. “Shalanda Young has an impressive, lengthy record of hard work and smart budgeting across all of the federal departments and programs,” they wrote.The White House emphasized Thursday that Young wouldn’t automatically get the top job of gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget.Biden clearly thinks highly of Young and she would be acting director of the budget office if confirmed, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. However, she added, “There is a range of individuals in the country who are qualified for the job.”If Biden chooses another woman of color to head the Office of Management and Budget, and all remaining nominees are confirmed, his cabinet will be 46% female and 50% non-white, including Biden and Harris, according to Inclusive America, a non-profit that tracks diversity in government.",Reuters

The three cases involve New York City, San Francisco and various states including California and New York.Biden, a Democrat, has rescinded the Republican Trump’s 2017 executive order that called on U.S. agencies to withhold federal funds from the so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, many of which are governed by Democrats. Lower courts were divided on whether the policy was lawful.Trump’s 2017 order conditioned receipt of federal funds by state and local governments on their giving U.S. immigration officials access to their jails, and advance notice when immigrants in the country illegally are being released from custody. It was one element of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and his battles with Democrats.The new administration has moved to reverse course on various Trump policies coming before the Supreme Court.The court last month canceled oral arguments in two other cases after the Biden administration changed course from Trump. Both were appeals by Trump’s administration - one defending his funding of the U.S.-Mexico border wall and the other defending his “remain in Mexico” asylum policy.The administration also has asked the court to cancel an upcoming argument on a policy introduced under Trump backing work requirements for people who receive healthcare under the Medicaid program for the poor.The administration last month told the justices the Obamacare healthcare law should be upheld, reversing the position taken under Trump.",Reuters

Biden wants to revive the deal, which was agreed by Tehran and six major powers.Biden’s bid for diplomacy has been overshadowed in recent weeks by rocket attacks by Iran-backed militia on U.S. forces in Iraq that have triggered concerns about escalation.Kahl suggested he would favor strong responses to such attacks.“When Iran takes actions against our own forces, we should defend ourselves and punch back,” Kahl said.‘PROXY WAR’ Tensions in Kahl’s confirmation hearing echoed concerns raised on Wednesday, when a different Senate panel grilled Wendy Sherman over her nomination to be No. 2 official at the State Department. Sherman helped negotiate the 2015 Iran deal, and so is also likely to lose Republican votes.During Thursday’s hearing, Kahl defended his concerns about Trump’s 2018 pullout from the Iran deal and the decision to pile pressure on Tehran, including round after round of economic sanctions. Kahl at the time worried it would encourage Iran to increase its provocations and accelerate its nuclear program.“Both of those things have happened in the last three years. Iran is a lot closer to the fissile material required for a nuclear weapon than they were at the end of the Obama administration,” Kahl said. “And we’ve seen more attacks.”Republican Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa said she would not support Kahl’s nomination and that members of the U.S. military “deserve someone that will take a serious outlook to policy.” Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said Kahl’s hearing was being used by critics to re-litigate the 2015 agreement.“I really believe that the controversy over your nomination is essentially a proxy war,” Kaine said. “Republicans didn’t like the Iran deal.”Republican Senator Tom Cotton said Kahl had warned on Twitter of the risk of conflict with Iran after the Trump administration killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani last year. He said Kahl had spent “the last four years warning about impending wars that never happened.”He also pointed to a tweet by Kahl describing Republicans as “the party of ethnic cleansing” after Trump abruptly ordered a Syria withdrawal in 2019 in a move that many said put at risk America’s Kurdish allies.Kahl apologized and said the last several years had been “pretty polarizing on social media.”“I’m sure there are times that I got swept up in that,” he said.",Reuters

Listing slightly to one side as an automated fire-suppression system trained a stream of water on flames still burning at the base of the rocket, the spacecraft blew itself to pieces about eight minutes after touchdown.It was the third such landing attempt to end in a fireball after an otherwise successful test flight for the Starship, being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars.For Musk, the billionaire SpaceX founder who also heads the electric carmaker Tesla Inc, the outcome was mixed news.The Starship SN10 came far closer to achieving a safe, vertical touchdown than two previous models - SN8 in December and SN9 in February. In a tweet responding to tempered congratulations from an admirer of his work, Musk replied, “RIP SN10, honorable discharge.”The video feed provided by SpaceX on the company’s YouTube channel cut off moments after the landing. But separate fan feeds streamed over the same social media platform showed an explosion suddenly erupting at the base of the rocket, hurling the SN10 into the air before it crashed to the ground and became engulfed in flames.The complete Starship rocket, which will stand 394-feet (120 metres) tall when mated with its super-heavy first-stage booster, is SpaceX’s next-generation fully reusable launch vehicle - the center of Musk’s ambitions to make human space travel more affordable and routine.A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year’s end.

Some producers are asking for clauses in their contracts with streaming services to protect them from lawsuits.“It’s just too much of a risk and not worth the headache, especially if you are being threatened with jail,” a producer said.",Reuters

Clubhouse had seen a surge in users who participated in discussions on sensitive topics such as Xinjiang detention camps and Hong Kong independence.New offerings include Xiaomi Corp’s reworking of its Mi Talk app into an invitation-only audio service targeted at professionals last week. More are currently under development, industry executives say.ByteDance’s plans are still in the early stages, said two sources who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.Discussions about TikTok and ByteDance on Clubhouse had prompted interest in the genre from ByteDance executives including CEO Zhang Yiming, said one of the sources.ByteDance declined to comment.The success of Clubhouse, which can host up to 8,000 people per chat room and has seen a discussion between Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk and Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev boost user numbers, has rammed home the potential of audio chat services.But similar apps in China are expected to take on Chinese characteristics that will accommodate censorship and government oversight.One such example is Nasdaq-listed Lizhi Inc’s Zhiya app which was launched in 2018 and whose users usually talk about video games or sing songs.The app requires real name registration, a trait Lizhi CEO Marco Lai says is key in China. Audio livestreaming companies in China employ staff to listen to conversations in every room and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) tools to weed out “inappropriate” content, such as pornography or politically sensitive issues, he said.A Lizhi spokeswoman said Zhiya uses humans as well as AI tools to regulate public conversations on the platform.The app was briefly taken down by Chinese regulators in 2019, but reinstated after Lizhi made rectifications.Lizhi’s Lai said that outside of politics there was plenty of room for audio chat apps in China.“Adults in China do not like to express their views in public, we have been taught to keep a low profile since we were young,” he said. “A good approach in China, though, is entertainment, you invite everybody to have fun.”Some new entrants to the market have had hiccups.Inke Ltd, best known for its livestreaming platform, launched a similar app, Duihuaba, this month that recruited venture capitalists, fashion critics and other celebrities to host conversations.However, it abruptly pulled the app two weeks after its debut, saying that it needed further improvements without elaborating.",Reuters

Experts believe successful stock market launches from the likes of Coinbase would help change that perception.Additionally, a decision by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether to approve crypto listings would serve as a major win or blow to the legitimacy of digital coins.“I do see a future where the SEC will continue to analyze and hopefully embrace bitcoin in particular. All of crypto is a much bigger question,” Cipher Mining Chief Executive Officer Tyler Page told Reuters.In January, cryptocurrency platform Bakkt also agreed to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm.“We wanted to get to market quickly and efficiently and after evaluating different paths, the SPAC market allowed us to get to market the quickest,” Page said, when asked why the firm chose the SPAC route.The deal with Good Works will provide the merged entity with gross cash proceeds of $595 million, which includes $425 million from investors including Fidelity Management & Research Company and Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global.The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021.",Reuters

Biden vowed to field a historically diverse team and has faced pressure from within his own ranks to live up to that promise in his administration’s early days.The new additions also come as the White House has been laying the groundwork for its second major spending bill, which it plans to unveil if it can shepherd Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill through congress this month. The Senate could vote on the bill as soon as this week.Meanwhile, on consumer protection issues, Biden has regularly turned to personnel like English whose views are aligned with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has advocated strict enforcement of the financial industry through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republican lawmakers largely regard the agency as too powerful and unaccountable.As a presidential candidate, Biden pledged to invest $2 trillion building climate-resilient homes, wiring cities for broadband internet, encouraging the manufacturing of fuel-efficient cars and installing electric vehicle charging stations, among other projects.He said the spending, paid for with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, would create millions of jobs for an economy reeling from the novel coronavirus pandemic while also shoring up the country’s resilience to climate change.Reynolds has studied topics including growing the domestic manufacturing base. Silverberg led the development of an $8 billion transit upgrade program at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.Biden and his transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, are expected to meet on Thursday afternoon with a bipartisan group of House of Representatives legislators on infrastructure.The White House has not specified how closely its legislative proposal will hew to the “Build Back Better” agenda Biden proposed as a candidate. Key decisions about the plan’s final cost and contents have not been finalized by his team, according to several people familiar with the plans.Infrastructure spending has backing in both parties. But Biden’s tax and spending plans have also drawn bipartisan push back. Former President Donald Trump unsuccessfully pushed for a major infrastructure bill during his term, which ended in January.",Reuters
883,"U.S. House passes 'George Floyd' police reform bill, Senate prospects unclear",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-police/u-s-house-passes-george-floyd-police-reform-bill-senate-prospects-unclear-idUSKCN2AW07N,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday banning controversial police tactics and easing the way for lawsuits against officers violating suspects’ constitutional rights, although the measure’s Senate prospects were uncertain.Democrats pushed the “George Floyd Justice in Policing Act” through the House by a vote of 220-212, with the support of only one Republican, just days before former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin goes on trial on a state murder charge in the death of Floyd last year.However, later on Wednesday evening, Representative Lance Gooden, the sole Republican who voted for the legislation, wrote in a post on Twitter that his vote had been a mistake and in fact he opposes the bill.Floyd, 46, an African-American man, died when he was detained with Chauvin kneeling on his neck for nearly eight minutes. His killing sparked weeks of nationwide and global protests, many of which were led by Black Lives Matter activists.“How many more people have to die, how many more people have to be brutalized on videotape” before police reforms become law, asked Democratic Representative Karen Bass, who wrote the legislation with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.The bill includes measures such as restricting certain funds to local governments that allow law enforcement officers to use choke holds, banning “no-knock warrants” that allow police officers to enter premises without announcing themselves and requiring law enforcement agencies to provide data on instances when police officers used deadly force.Bass said the bill would hold police “accountable” when constitutional rights are violated but would also support local law enforcement by fostering improvements in community policing, especially for minority neighborhoods.One of its most controversial provisions would change “qualified immunity” for police, further opening the door for lawsuits over the use of excessive force.Reuters in May 2020 published an investigation revealing how qualified immunity, with the Supreme Court’s continual refinements, had made it easier for police officers to kill or injure civilians with impunity.Conservative Republicans have attacked the Democratic bill, saying it would put law enforcement lives in danger and make communities less safe.The police reform effort sputtered in Congress last summer after the House passed the so-called George Floyd bill and Democrats blocked a Senate Republican bill.While the Republican bill also addressed issues such as police choke holds, no-knock warrants and use of police body cameras, Democrats complained it relied on incentives rather than mandating changes.Senator Tim Scott, the author of the Republican bill, told Reuters in a statement he welcomed conversations with Democrats over qualified immunity.",Reuters

SEAT-branded electric cars are currently manufactured in Germany and Slovakia.SEAT Chairman Wayne Griffiths said his company was seeking a broad alliance with Iberdrola, phone operator Telefonica and Caixabank, as well as other Spanish companies, to meet its electric mobility goal.At SEAT’s plant, King Felipe said Spain’s strategy to develop electric vehicles was “irreversible” and that authorities will give their total support to the automotive sector, that accounts for 8% of the economy.",Reuters

U.S. grocery delivery app Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through a traditional initial public offering (IPO), according to people familiar with the matter.

In a direct listing, companies go public without raising money through a stock sale.Shares of newly listed U.S. companies that went public through an IPO ended trading up 36.2% on average on their first day last year, compared to 17.2% in 2019, according to data firm Dealogic.Investment bankers say they often struggle to price in the impact of huge investor demand for popular consumer names, such as home-sharing start-up Airbnb Inc and food delivery app DoorDash Inc, given the limited initial stock float of these companies. Some venture capital investors, such as Benchmark general partner Bill Gurley, say bankers keep IPO prices low to favor their Wall Street clients.Instacart has no short-term need for cash after raising $265 million in a private fundraising round earlier this week. The company’s business has benefited from more consumers shopping groceries online more to cook at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.Investment bankers working on Instacart’s listing have estimated that it could be valued by the stock market at more than $50 billion, two of the sources said. Instacart said earlier this week its latest fundraising round valued it at $39 billion.The San Francisco-based company has yet to make a final decision on how it will go public, the sources cautioned, requesting anonymity as the discussions are confidential.Instacart declined to comment.IPOs have been on a tear since last summer as markets rallied following the Federal Reserve’s moves to support the U.S. economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet their popularity has been eroding as more companies choose to go public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) or direct listings.There were 208 IPOs excluding SPACs last year, the most since 2015, according to Dealogic. By comparison, 249 SPACs went public through IPOs. Two prominent direct listings last year were those of technology firms Palantir Technologies Inc and Asana Inc.Only a handful of companies have gone public through a direct listing since it was pioneered in 2018 by music streaming platform Spotify Technology SA.U.S. gaming platform Roblox Corp abandoned plans for an IPO earlier this year because it did not want to leave money on the table. It is slated to debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) next week through a direct listing.U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc has said it is looking to go public through a direct listing. Online broker Robinhood and robotic software startup UiPath Inc also considering choosing a direct listing over an IPO, according to people familiar with the matter.Robinhood and UiPath declined to comment.Once a company goes public through a direct listing, insiders can typically sell their shares immediately rather than be restricted for months, as is the case with IPOs.A company can also sell its shares in the open market to raise capital following a direct listing without restrictions, typically after it has reported quarterly earnings. Some companies opting for direct listings also choose to raise money before they go public through private fundraising rounds.The NYSE now offers companies the option to raise money in a direct listing after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved it in December.Under the NYSE’s new model, new shares being sold in the newly listed company have to trade within a pre-set range for money to be raised, or the listing has to be postponed. No company has taken up this option so far, though dozens have contacted the NYSE to express interest in it and several are actively pursuing it, according to a person familiar with the matter.The NYSE declined to comment.",Reuters

He has not been charged with a crime. Officials declined to say whether any other agents were present.Federal agents have charged more than 300 people so far with taking part in the riot, including several with connections to law enforcement. They include police officers from Texas and Virginia, a former New York City police officer and a retired FBI section chief who prosecutors allege plotted with a militia group to overrun the Capitol.Gaspari said Ibrahim was outside the Capitol because “it was a historic event.” She said he did not pass a set of metal barricades outside the building that were quickly overrun by the crowd.While members of the group smashed windows and rampaged through the Capitol, hunting for then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress, others fought with police outside, hitting them with flagpoles and dousing them in bear spray.“We’re walking a line between the First Amendment and insurrectionist behavior,” Gaspari said.Ibrahim worked in a DEA office in the Los Angeles suburbs.

(Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR)However, the decline in cases plateaued last week with new infections rising in 29 out of 50 states compared with the prior week. Texas saw a 69% rise in cases in the week ended Feb. 28.Few of the rollbacks have been as sweeping as in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday said the state’s mask mandate would be lifted and most businesses could open at full capacity next week.The move drew immediate criticism from some politicians and public health experts who have urged caution while the nation’s vaccination program is still underway.President Joe Biden said on Wednesday that decisions to end the required wearing of masks - such as those made by Texas and Mississippi - amounted to “Neanderthal thinking” given the ongoing deaths being caused by the pandemic.“I think it’s a big mistake. Look, I hope everybody’s realized by now, these masks make a difference,” he told reporters.Public health experts agree face coverings are essential to slowing the spread of the virus, which has killed more than half a million Americans. But over the last year, resistance to public health measures in the United States, especially mask-wearing, has become politicized, with many Republican states enacting fewer and looser COVID-19 protocols than Democratic states.In some Republican-led states, including Florida and South Dakota, there has never been a statewide mask mandate. In others, like Alabama and Ohio, mask mandates remain in effect.Including the upcoming change in Texas, 34 states mandate that residents wear face masks in public, along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.In Ohio, U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel on Wednesday called on Republican Governor Mike DeWine to follow Texas’ lead and repeal the statewide mask order. The governor quickly rejected the idea.“Ohio will be keeping its mask mandate to protect Ohioans who have yet to receive the vaccine. Vaccine supply is increasing, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, but the virus is still here and the pandemic is still ongoing today,” a spokesman for DeWine told Reuters in an email.Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia, a Republican, said on Wednesday he was not ready to ease any restrictions, including an indoor mask mandate.“All businesses must continue to follow the safety guidelines,” Justice said.Abbott’s executive order in Texas will lift all mask requirements statewide as of March 10 and forbid local authorities from penalizing residents who do not wear face coverings. It will remove all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of hospitalizations.Local officials can still apply limits to businesses where hospitalizations remain high, according to the order, but are prohibited from mandating that they operate at less than 50% capacity.As of Monday, Texas was seeing about 7,500 new cases per day on a seven-day average, according to Reuters data, and it was ranked 47th in the list of states that have vaccinated the highest percentage of their populations.Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, on Tuesday also lifted his state’s mask order and removed all restrictions on businesses.But Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat in a majority Republican state, doubled down on his state’s mask order even as it increased capacity to 75% at restaurants and retail businesses on Wednesday.“Louisiana’s mask mandate is still in place,” Edwards tweeted. “As we vaccinate more and more people, masks are still our most effective tool in stopping the spread of COVID-19 and saving lives.”",Reuters
897,"Analysis: Wealth managers frustrated over bitcoin, anxious for piece of the action
The rollercoster ride in bitcoin since the start of the year has not dampened wealth manager Jim Paulsen's enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency.
MAR 05 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-funds-bitcoin-analysis/analysis-wealth-managers-frustrated-over-bitcoin-anxious-for-piece-of-the-action-idUSKBN2AX0FB,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The rollercoster ride in bitcoin since the start of the year has not dampened wealth manager Jim Paulsen’s enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency.Yet Paulsen, chief investment officer for Leuthold Group, which manages $1 billion, cannot own bitcoin in client portfolios due to regulatory constraints. This has left him on the sidelines watching the world’s most popular cyrptocurrency surge more than 900% since its March lows in volatile trading that also saw bitcoin lose more than 20% in the span of a few days.“What I like about bitcoin is... its correlation to stocks and other assets is extraordinarily independent,” said Paulsen, who remains frustrated that he cannot own it for clients.The promise of an asset class that behaves differently than stocks or bonds is leaving portfolio and wealth managers scrambling own cryptocurrencies if they can.Many view bitcoin as a good inflation hedge. Nearly 20% of advisors are contemplating investing in cyryptocurrencies this year due to concerns about inflation, up from 6.3% in 2019, according to a report from Citi.Still, a number of advisors say they are unable to own bitcoin for their clients until they can hold it in an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund that clears legal hurdles common for any investment.Should that happen, institutional money could flow in and push the asset class higher, analysts said.BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, said on Jan. 21 it was adding bitcoin futures as eligible investments for certain funds. Fund experts expect other asset management firms to follow suit.Yet the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not yet recognize cryptocurrencies as a security like a stock or a bond, and has not ruled whether mutual funds can own them directly, said Robert Jenkins, global head of research at Refinitiv Lipper. So it remains unclear whether any mutual funds currently own bitcoin because they are not required to disclose it, he said.In the United States, eight firms have tried without success since 2013 to create a bitcoin ETF, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at New York based CFRA.The SEC did not respond to questions for this article.Funds like the popular ARK Invest ETF line that have positions in bitcoin do it through shares of the Greyscale Bitcoin Trust, a publicly traded trust that holds a set number of bitcoin units and often trades at a premium to the value of its underlying portfolio.Securities regulators in Canada approved the world’s first bitcoin ETF on Feb. 12, leading some investors to hope that U.S. regulators will shortly follow.President Joe Biden’s nominee to head the SEC, Gary Gensler, spoke in broad terms about crytocurrencies in a confirmation hearing Tuesday, suggesting that the agency should provide more regulation on how it views the asset class. Some investors have taken his appointment as raising the likelihood that a bitcoin ETF will be approved for the U.S.Gensler “seems more crypto-friendly than previous folks who had oversight,” said Viraj Patel, head of asset allocation at Fiduciary Trust International, who has not yet made investments in the asset class for clients but is waiting for a U.S.-based ETF. “We’re really looking at cryptocurrency through the lens of this could be gold 2.0,” said Patel.Still, Rosenbluth said he was skeptical of a product being approved this year, saying there would be a high bar to clear tied to market manipulation and custody audit.Even in the absence of an ETF, retail interest “remains strong with no signs of abating,” JP Morgan analysts wrote in a Feb 16 research note.Overall, cyptocurrency funds and products that investors can buy direct brought in nearly $5.6 billion in assets in 2020, up more than 600% from the year before, according to asset manager CoinShares. Cryptocurrency funds have gathered $4.2 billion in flows for this year through March 1, Coinshares said.“Not allowing the purchase of cyrpto is something that’s frustrating to many advisors, but it’s such a volatile asset that many investors end up doing it on their own,” said Jimmy Lee, chief executive of the Wealth Consulting Group.",Reuters

Adding a polyurethane mask on top boosted the effectiveness to just 89%.Wearing two non-woven masks isn’t useful because air resistance builds up and causes leakage around the edges.“The performance of double masking simply does not add up,” wrote the researchers, led by Makoto Tsubokura.In general, professional grade N95 masks were the best in protecting against infection, followed by non-woven masks, cloth masks, and finally polyurethane types, the study showed.The Riken research team previously used the Fugaku supercomputer to model how humidity can affect viral contagion and the infection risks in trains, work spaces, and other environments.As the COVID-19 epidemic has worn on, scientific consensus has grown that the virus is spread through the air and masks are effective in controlling contagion.",Reuters
900,"GameStop spikes as investors eye cryptic tweet by shareholder
Shares of Reddit-darling GameStop climbed on Thursday, rising more than 20% at one point in yet another unexplained move that left market watchers looking for a possible catalyst.

A Feb. 24 surge in the company’s shares began roughly around the time Cohen tweeted a picture of a McDonald’s ice cream cone with a frog emoji.The tweet left some GameStop bulls wondering online whether it was a veiled message that Cohen would fix GameStop’s business, like the fast-food chain modernized its ice cream machines.GameStop has become one of the most visible of the so-called meme stocks that are closely followed on sites such as Reddit’s popular WallStreetBets forum.The stock surged more than 1,600% in January after a wave of buying forced investors betting against the company’s shares to unwind their positions, before paring most of those gains the following month.Cohen’s RC Ventures activist firm reached a settlement with GameStop in January, giving Cohen seats on the company’s board.",Reuters

Payments firm Square Inc agreed on Thursday to buy a majority stake in rapper Jay-Z's Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in a deal that could popularize blockchain or other new approaches to storing and buying online media.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tidal-stake-square/squares-297-million-deal-for-jay-zs-music-service-tidal-may-bring-blockchain-to-masses-idUSKBN2AW1N8,"(Reuters) - Payments firm Square Inc agreed on Thursday to buy a majority stake in rapper Jay-Z’s Tidal music streaming service for $297 million in a deal that could popularize blockchain or other new approaches to storing and buying online media.Square Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, who also runs Twitter Inc, said in a statement that the tie-up “comes down to one simple idea: finding new ways for artists to support their work.”Square and Tidal would work on new listening experiences “to bring fans closer together,” simple integrations for merchandise sales and financial tools for artists, he added in a Twitter post.Such new offerings could take advantage of emerging technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies that Dorsey views highly, said Avivah Litan, a technology analyst at consulting company Gartner.“You need the applications to drive the new economy,” Litan said. “No one’s going to just go get a cryptocurrency wallet if there’s nothing to buy.”Among the obscure blockchain systems that Square and Tidal could help popularize are digital files known as non-fungible tokens (NFT) that serve as digital signatures to certify who owns photos, videos and other online media.The provenance of autographs and memorabilia could be tracked by associated NFT, Litan said, potentially making them even more valuable and significant to artists’ fans.Dorsey has supported so-called decentralization technologies such as blockchain because they enable people to store data and process transactions without relying on big tech companies and other service providers that profit off being a gatekeeper.While companies still could develop related businesses, consumers would have more control over what they view and own online, Dorsey said at a conference last year.Martha Bennett, an analyst at the consulting firm Forrester, said companies and artists already trying to sell music directly to fans through blockchain-based systems have had limited success.Tidal calls itself an artist-owned service backed by Kanye West, Beyoncé, Madonna, Rihanna and Nicki Minaj among others, and is available in more than 56 countries. It has sought to distinguish itself from Spotify and other rivals by committing to providing higher sound quality to listeners and a greater share of revenue to artists. But it has lagged in subscribers.“When you think purely about breaking into the market, if somebody with the brand name of Jay-Z and Beyonce don’t manage to break the stranglehold of the well-established streaming platforms then who else can,” Bennett said.Square did not disclose the percentage of its ownership via the cash and stock deal. Tidal will operate independently and existing artist shareholders will maintain ownership, Square said.It added that Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, would join its board.Jay-Z bought Tidal for roughly $56 million in 2015 from Norwegian entrepreneurs.",Reuters
903,"Global semiconductor shortage spurs run on vintage chipmaking tools
Minnesota-based Polar Semiconductor makes chips for automakers and is booked beyond capacity. But expanding production lines to help solve a chip shortage that is shutting down car factories around the world is not feasible - in part due to the scarcity of older-style chipmaking machinery.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-tools/global-semiconductor-shortage-spurs-run-on-vintage-chipmaking-tools-idUSKBN2AW18P,"(Reuters) - Minnesota-based Polar Semiconductor makes chips for automakers and is booked beyond capacity. But expanding production lines to help solve a chip shortage that is shutting down car factories around the world is not feasible - in part due to the scarcity of older-style chipmaking machinery.Chip factories like Polar use these tools to make chips on 200-millimeter silicon wafers, which were state-of-the-art two decades ago. Now, advanced chips are made using much larger wafers, but there is still a lot of demand for simpler, older chips.The demand has been supercharged by a combination of the COVID-19-driven boom in computer gear and unexpected strength in auto sales that resulted in shortages. General Motors Co on Wednesday extended production cuts at three North American plants and added a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Fiat Chrysler owner Stellantis warned the pain could linger far into the year. Shortages forced Ford Motor Co to slash shifts for production of its F-150 pickup truck, a longtime profit driver.Automakers use a range of chips in cars. Some, such as those in infotainment systems, are made in the same cutting-edge chip factories that make smartphone chips. But other chips in braking and engine systems are made using older, proven technologies that meet automakers’ durability and reliability requirements.But the machines to make those older chips can take six to nine months to find, said Surya Iyer, vice president of operations and quality at Polar.“There’s no way I can expand capacity beyond just stretching my limits,” Iyer said. “A real capacity increase would take nine to 12 months, minimum.”Resellers of chipmaking gear saying they cannot find used equipment, leading some buyers to stalk old factories in the United States, Japan and Europe, waiting for them to close in hopes of snapping up the gear inside.“Demand is hot for used equipment, but we don’t have enough of them to cope with demand,” said Bruce Kim, chief executive of South Korea’s SurplusGLOBAL, one of the largest dealers of used chipmaking gear.He said used equipment prices have gone up by as much as 20% over the past six months, while the number of refurbished 200mm tools fell to 1,000, down from between 7,000 to 8,000 a decade ago.Ohio-based Rite Track, in normal times, buys up old chipmaking equipment, upgrades it and sells it to chip factories. But Chief Executive Tim Hayden said the recent squeeze has spurred the company to spend more time sending technicians out to upgrade tools that are already installed on factory floors in order to squeeze more chips out of them.“You just can’t go out on the open market and buy a used 200-millimeter tool - they’re just not readily available,” Hayden said. “So people are getting a little bit more creative.”Demand for old tools is so robust that buyers are looking at every kind of factory. Spin Memory in Fremont, California, is designing a new kind of memory chip and maintains a small “pilot production line,” mostly to provide samples to potential customers, said Chief Executive Tom Sparkman. Even though Spin Memory’s tools use 20-year-old technology, Sparkman gets offers to buy them almost every day.“We haven’t taken the plunge to get rid of it yet, but some days it’s tempting,” he said.Toolmakers such as Applied Materials Inc and Lam Research Corp, meanwhile, are building booming businesses by refurbishing or recreating some of their greatest hits from the 1990s and earlier.“It’s really exploding,” said Mike Rosa, head of strategic and technical marketing for a group at Applied Materials, the world’s biggest chip-equipment vendor.David Haynes, a managing director at Lam Research, said demand for 200-millimeter tools was once mostly from China as it worked to build up its domestic chipmaking industry. Now, he said, customers from around the world are looking to buy or upgrade older tools.Still, investment in older technology lags relative to the spending on more advanced production lines, or “nodes” as they are known in the industry.“Most of the capital expenditure has been going into advanced nodes,” said Tyson Tuttle, chief executive of Silicon Laboratories Inc, which designs automotive chips to be made on older technology. Chipmakers “have always relied on the fact that the digital guys move out of the older nodes, and that frees up capacity for all the support chips. The problem is, the digital guys aren’t moving out as fast. The mainstream nodes are all just jammed.”",Reuters

Canadian prosecutors told a court on Thursday that it was not a judge's role to decide whether national security and geopolitical concerns can be used to strike down a U.S. request to extradite Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.

She has said she is innocent and is fighting her extradition case from under house arrest in Vancouver.Prosecutors argued on Thursday that if Meng had become a bargaining chip in a trade war between the United States and China, as her lawyers say, then Canada’s minister of justice was the right person to decide that, not a judge.Canada’s extradition process dictates that a judge will first decide whether an extradition claim is legal, before the country’s justice minister makes a final decision on whether to extradite that person.Lawyers for the Huawei chief financial officer have asked for her case to be thrown out. They point to statements made by former U.S. President Donald Trump in December 2018, when he said he would intervene in the case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater said a British Columbia Supreme Court judge would not be able to determine whether Huawei was indeed a national security threat to the United States, as defence lawyer Richard Peck suggested on Wednesday.“Peck can’t prove that’s false, I can’t prove that’s true,” Frater said. “The only thing you can do is presume good faith.”Frater previously called Trump’s comments “vague” and listed statements by other U.S. officials who spoke against interference.“Everyone in this courtroom knows that the elephant in the room in this case has always been the geopolitical winds that swirl around it,” Frater said on Thursday, adding that the defence tried to bring the elephant into court.He urged the judge to focus on facts and law, and “leave the politics to the politicians.”Defence attorney Eric Gottardi acknowledged that Trump may have been vague about the manner and timing of his alleged threat, but said that the president was not vague about his intention to intervene.Gottardi said that more appropriate comments made by other U.S. officials were not as influential as they were all subordinate to the president.“He has the most authority,” Gottardi said.Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing broke down in the wake of Meng’s arrest. Days later, China detained two Canadians on espionage charges, which Canada viewed as retaliation.Hearings were expected to last five days this week but both sides completed their arguments early. Meng will return to court on March 15. Her case is set to wrap up in May.",Reuters

That meant the company’s chip revenue fell short of expectations despite strong smartphone sales from Apple.“While we had anticipated some challenges in the supply chain for Broadcom in the January quarter, its semiconductor business performance did underperform its large-cap peer group in spite of the stronger-than-seasonal wireless business.”On a conference call with investors, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said the company has seen customers putting in orders well in advance as the company’s lead times have extended to as long as eight months. But he said Broadcom believes it can deliver those orders on time.“This is not a panic mode. This is a very structured and reasonable process, which we believe, at the end of it all, still shows a real underlying demand,” Tan said.Broadcom forecast second-quarter revenue of about $6.5 billion, compared with analysts’ estimates of $6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.For the fiscal first quarter, Broadcom’s infrastructure software business had sales of $1.74 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $1.64 billion, according to Refinitiv data. The strong software revenue helped overall sales rise to $6.66 billion in the fiscal first quarter from $5.86 billion a year earlier. Overall first-quarter sales beat analyst expectations of $6.62 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Excluding items, the company earned $6.61 per share in the fiscal first quarter, beating analysts’ estimate of $6.56 per share.A ramp-up in 5G technology adoption is expected to boost demand for higher-priced chips used in phones and is likely to benefit semiconductor firms such as Broadcom.The company, which also makes chips for data centers and servers, also stands to benefit from an extended remote working trend as people wait for vaccines to roll out.",Reuters

Collins’ support allows extra breathing room should another Democrat oppose the nomination.Manchin and Collins earlier rejected Biden’s proposed budget director, Neera Tanden, whose nomination was yanked on Tuesday.The two senators acknowledged the differ with Haaland on some issues, but praised her vow to work with both political parties.Collins, in her statement on Wednesday, also cited “Haaland’s willingness to support issues important to the State of Maine, such as Acadia National Park, as well as her deep knowledge of tribal issues.”The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is expected to vote on Haaland’s nomination on Thursday. If approved, it would move to the full Senate for a vote.Tensions were raised at her confirmation hearing last week as Republicans targeted her past opposition to fossil fuel projects and Biden’s agenda to combat climate change.The Interior Department oversees the nation’s vast public lands and waters, including 500 million acres of federal and tribal lands as well as offshore federal waters.",Reuters

But that was not an option after moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he would not vote to approve the think tank director.Manchin’s defection had sent the White House - and Tanden - scrambling to find one Republican backer. But they ultimately came up empty-handed, even after a last-minute meeting with Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski on Monday.Her backers decried what they called a hypocritical and sexist push to punish Tanden for harsh tweets directed at both Democrats and Republicans, after four years of similar language used by Republican former President Donald Trump.Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, tweeted: “Disheartening. For salty tweets. After what we’ve been through for 4 years.”Biden said he still planned to have Tanden - a confidante of former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton - serve in his administration, but did not say which job she might get.Tanden, 50, an Indian American, would have been the first woman of color to lead the OMB, which manages the $4 trillion federal budget.Shalanda Young, Biden’s pick for the No. 2 OMB job, has won the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus to replace Tanden. A former staffer in the House of Representatives, Young would be the second Black woman in Biden’s Cabinet if she were to become OMB director.In an interview with CNN prior to the announcement that Tanden was withdrawing her nomination, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders said Young did “really, really well” during her confirmation hearing on Tuesday for the deputy’s post.Asked if he would support her for the top job, Sanders said: “Ms. Young made a very strong presentation today. ... But it is the function of the president of the United States to make that nomination, not me.”Other possible candidates include former National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling and Ann O’Leary, another former aide to Hillary Clinton.

(Reuters) - Leaders of South Dakota’s legislature said on Tuesday they would push to suspend impeachment action against Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg over his conduct in a fatal car crash until criminal charges lodged against him are resolved.Calls for Ravnsborg’s ouster mounted last month after state authorities took the extraordinary step of releasing video of police interrogations of the attorney general and other evidence from the Sept. 12 incident, in which his car struck and killed a man walking along a highway.As shown in the video, Ravnsborg told police he believed he had run into a deer, rather than a person, until he returned to the scene the following day to find the body of the victim, 55-year-old Joe Boever, lying in a roadside ditch.Investigators suggested that Ravnsborg’s account lacked credibility, telling him under questioning that a broken pair of eyeglasses belonging to Boever were found in his car, meaning the victim’s face had gone through the windshield on impact.Police also told Ravnsborg that Boever had been carrying a flashlight, which was still illuminated when they found it the next day, and that evidence showed Ravnsborg’s car had driven onto the shoulder of the road where the victim was walking.The video sparked immediate outrage. Governor Kristi Noem demanded the resignation of Ravnsborg, a fellow Republican facing three misdemeanor charges in the accident. A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced an impeachment resolution in the state’s Republican-controlled House of Representatives.But dynamics changed after a state judge last week ruled that public posting of investigative evidence violated Ravnsborg’s rights to a fair trial and ordered such material in the criminal probe sealed.In a joint statement on Tuesday, House Speaker Spencer Gosch and other legislative leaders called for halting impeachment proceedings at least until “the courts have concluded their business” in the case.“Our proceedings need to be fair and transparent,” Gosch said, adding that in light of last week’s court order, “we have some concerns on what our abilities are in a public proceeding.”The suspension was expected to be adopted by a House committee as an amendment to the impeachment resolution on Wednesday.The announcement came nearly six months after the deadly nighttime crash, which occurred near Highmore, as the attorney general was driving home to Pierre, the state capital, from a fundraiser. Highmore is about 50 miles east of Pierre.Ravnsborg insisted he never saw anyone by the side of the road, never saw a light in the pitch dark, and was so startled by the collision that he was focused on pulling his car safely to the side of the road.Ravnsborg also denied veering onto the shoulder of the road before the collision. He said he was setting the vehicle on cruise-control when the crash occurred and was not distracted with his cellphone or other devices.Toxicology tests released by state authorities showed no evidence of impairment.",Reuters

The U.S. Senate is considering including in a new bill to boost competitiveness against China $30 billion in funding for previously-approved measures to supercharge the country's chipmaking industry, a congressional source said on Thursday.
MAR 04 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-chips/u-s-senate-mulls-30-billion-in-funding-to-boost-chipmaking-sector-source-says-idUSKBN2AW2EK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate is considering including in a new bill to boost competitiveness against China $30 billion in funding for previously-approved measures to supercharge the country’s chipmaking industry, a congressional source said on Thursday.Lawmakers aim to bring the package, which would include other elements to boost the U.S. tech sector, to a full vote in April, the person said, declining to be named because the legislation has not been finalized.The source, who is involved in the effort, said that the Schumer-led package is likely to have provisions curbing China’s access to U.S. capital markets, a focus of the Trump administration’s crackdown on Beijing.A spokesman for U.S. Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer, who is spearheading the new package, did not respond to a request for comment.Schumer said last month he had directed lawmakers to craft a new bill to boost U.S. competitiveness against China, based on legislation he and Republican Senator Todd Young proposed last year to provide funding of $100 billion to spur research in key tech areas, from artificial intelligence to quantum computing and semiconductors.Schumer’s office also said the package could be used as a vehicle to provide emergency funding for the bipartisan semiconductor programs included in last year’s National Defense Authorization Act, which are still awaiting money.One of those unfunded programs would provide grants to companies investing in U.S. factories and equipment for semiconductor manufacturing, testing, and research and development. Another directs the government to establish a public-private partnership to form consortia of firms to produce “measurably secure microelectronics.”The semiconductor industry has also been pushing for an investment tax credit for spending on semiconductor tools, which can cost billions of dollars for new factories and typically far outstrip the cost of buildings.The effort comes as U.S. automakers have slowed production on a global shortage of semiconductor chips, in high demand due to a consumer-driven boom in demand for cell phones and computers during the coronavirus pandemic.",Reuters
911,"Exclusive: Amid shortage, U.S. suppliers to Chinese chip giant SMIC struggle to get export licenses
The U.S. government has been slow to approve licenses for American companies like Lam Research Corp and Applied Materials Inc to sell chipmaking equipment to China semiconductor giant SMIC, sources said, as the impact of a global chip shortage spreads.

Certain licenses have been granted, including for small numbers of expensive equipment in recent days.As policy shifts under President Joe Biden, who took over from Donald Trump in January, U.S. government agencies led by new appointees still have not completely decided what should be sold to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, which produces chips for Qualcomm Inc and other American companies.The Trump administration placed SMIC on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s entity list over concerns of SMIC aiding China’s military.The listing, which requires U.S. suppliers to obtain a license before shipping goods to SMIC, is unusual because it says most products should be granted on a case-by-case basis. However, equipment that can be used to make only the most advanced, 10-nanometer and smaller chips is likely to be denied licenses.The administration is supposed to make decisions on license applications within a month, but follow-up questions stop the clock.“Lam Research is still in the application process and has not yet received a response,” a Fremont, California, company spokeswoman said on Wednesday.Applied Materials’ chief financial officer said in a Feb. 18 earnings call its forecast did not assume licenses would come through. A spokesman for the Santa Clara, California-based company declined further comment on the licenses this week.SMIC did not respond to requests for comment, but the company has said it provides services solely for civilian and commercial end users and that it has no ties to the Chinese military.Decisions on licenses have been held up as officials ask follow-up questions about applications in part to determine whether the parts or components could be diverted for use in producing items 10 nm or smaller, sources said.Washington trade lawyer Giovanna Cinelli said many license applications have resulted in “a lot of back and forth, which has elongated the period of review.”In a statement, a Commerce Department official dismissed the possibility that curbs on SMIC could contribute to the chip shortage, noting that the shortfall was tied to older technologies while SMIC restrictions relate to leading-edge technology. The statement did not address the potential impact of delays in licenses for older technology.SMIC, the largest foundry in mainland China, is an important player in the global semiconductor supply chain, which is under pressure as pandemic lockdowns drive up demand for electronics such as laptops and phones. Last month, it said it could not meet customer demands for certain technologies and its plants have been running “fully loaded” for several quarters.SMIC’s technological capabilities lag far behind cutting-edge foundries like industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, according to industry sources.Companies like Applied Materials and Lam Research, two key suppliers of production equipment, submitted numerous license applications to sell to the company. The bulk have not yet been acted on, industry sources said.A spokeswoman for Entegris Inc, an advanced materials supplier, said the Massachusetts-based company had submitted 10 applications to sell to SMIC and received its first license in the past week.Other companies that ship to SMIC include California’s KLA Corp and Massachusetts-based Axcelis Technologies Inc . A KLA spokeswoman declined to comment on any licenses and, while Axcelis’ CEO spoke of “uncertainty” related to its licenses on Feb. 11, a company spokeswoman declined to provide an update.Cymer, a San Diego company that makes deep ultraviolet light sources, is also among suppliers that need licenses to send parts to SMIC. A spokeswoman for ASML, the Dutch chip equipment maker that owns Cymer, declined to comment on the licenses, saying she could not discuss customer-specific information.Qualcomm, which uses the Chinese foundry to produce chips with decades-old technology, put in applications for tools SMIC needs to produce the chips, just in case equipment makers do not get their licenses for the tools, an industry source said. But they have not come through yet, the source added.In September, SEMI, a worldwide industry group, said in a draft letter seen by Reuters that SMIC accounts for as much as $5 billion in annual U.S. sales.",Reuters

She said recent warnings by the Capitol police about a potential new attack on Thursday showed that an “elevated violence risk still remains.”Wojcicki said that YouTube would determine the risk of violence by looking at signals such as government statements and warnings, increased law enforcement around the country and violent rhetoric on the platform itself.In the aftermath of the Jan 6. riot, social media companies including Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc banned Trump’s accounts on their platforms. Twitter’s ban is permanent, while Facebook has sent the case to its independent oversight board to decide whether Trump’s accounts should be unblocked.“We will turn the account back on,” Wojcicki said. “But it will be when we see the reduced law enforcement in capitals in the U.S, if we don’t see different warnings coming out of government agencies, those would all be signals to us that it would be safe to turn the channel back on.”Trump spokesman Jason Miller did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Security around the Capitol was tight on Thursday after police warned that a militia group might try to attack it to mark a key date on the calendar of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.Under YouTube’s policies, if an account has three “strikes” in a 90 day period it will be terminated. The suspension of Trump’s account, for a minimum of a week, was because it gained a first “strike.” YouTube also indefinitely disabled comments under videos on the channel.Major social media companies have been under pressure to curb conspiracy theories, violent rhetoric and other abuses on their sites.A report from the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of misinformation researchers, said in a report this week that YouTube provided a space for video misinformation to be shared easily across multiple platforms and that this content functioned to provide “evidence” for misleading narratives.",Reuters

But Japan’s No.2 automaker is stepping up its game in self-driving technology as global competitors aim for fully autonomous vehicles.There are different levels of automation, from levels 0 to 5, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers and most automakers. hereLevel 3, also known as conditional driving automation, involves automated features which allow drivers to engage in activities behind the wheel, such as watching movies or using smartphones - but under limited conditions - while their car navigates expressway traffic.Besides Honda, several automakers including Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz have said they are ready to deploy Level 3 systems for highway driving.Levels 0 to 2 involve driver support features such as automated braking systems and lane departure warnings that need to be supervised by a driver. Liability for vehicle behaviour rests with the car owner rather than the manufacturer.Most global automakers that develop autonomous driving technology such as General Motors Co , Volvo and Toyota Motor Corp, currently offer vehicles equipped with a level 2 automation system. This means vehicles can accelerate, brake and steer without driver input, but drivers are required to remain engaged at all times.A level 5 vehicle, on the other hand, is fully autonomous and can navigate roads without any human attention in all conditions.Honda’s level 3 “Traffic Jam Pilot” system uses data from 3D high-definition maps and a global navigation satellite system for vehicle control, as well as a dozen of external sensors to detect the car’s surroundings.The system can alert the driver to respond when handing over the control, for example via vibration on the driver’s seatbelt.And if the driver is unresponsive, the system will assist with an emergency stop by decelerating and stopping the vehicle while alerting surrounding cars with hazard lights and the horn.Honda simulated around 10 million patterns of possible real-world situations, and conducted a massive number of demonstration tests on highways to create safe-driving technology, said Hitoshi Aoki, the Legend’s development manager.($1 = 107.3300 yen)",Reuters

That could provide a boost to nuclear power, an industry experiencing shutdowns amid low prices for natural gas, a competing fuel.The bill also sets a goal of a fully decarbonized economy by 2050.On transportation, the largest source of carbon emissions, the bill authorizes $100 million annually from fiscal 2022 to 2031 for entities that install publicly accessible electric vehicle (EV) supply equipment. It also requires the energy secretary to establish a program to help determine where EV charging stations are needed and expands EV access in disadvantaged communities.The legislation, which needs to pass committees and then the full House and Senate and be signed by Biden before becoming law, does not include a carbon tax, a mechanism supported by some Republicans and companies.“The votes are just not there for a price on carbon,” also known as a carbon tax, Pallone told reporters. He said a carbon price had concerns from an environmental justice perspective because it could allow industries to keep polluting as long as they buy permits from entities that have cut emissions elsewhere.“It’s time to try something new,” Pallone said, noting that carbon tax plans failed in Congress most recently in 2009/2010. Tonko, who prefers a carbon tax, called a clean energy standard “achievable.”Three Republican representatives, including David McKinley from coal-producing West Virginia, said the bill’s mandates would raise energy prices and make the country more reliant on Chinese critical mineral supplies.They want policies to “capture all the advantages of our abundant resources, which include coal, hydropower, nuclear technologies, and clean natural gas.”Another climate bill from McKinley, and Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, includes a less ambitious goal of requiring utilities to cut emissions 80% by 2050. Pallone said his bill could be adjusted to draw Republican support.Given the thinnest possible Democratic majority in the Senate, Pallone suggested that senators could try to pass the bill under budget reconciliation in that chamber. That process requires only 51 votes instead of 60 in the 100-member Senate.",Reuters

Raising the hourly wage to $15 was a campaign promise of Democratic President Joe Biden.“The minimum wage as it now stands is immoral,” Hoyer, a Democrat, told reporters.In the Senate, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters a minimum wage increase along the lines that Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney have proposed was “worth discussing,” but not a hike to $15. Cotton and Romney say the hourly wage could be gradually raised to $10.Democrats had hoped to get a minimum wage increase to $15 included in a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, which is currently being advanced under a process that allows it to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes normally required in the Senate. But the Senate’s rules expert said no.So the House will bring the $15 wage proposal to the floor “in the near future,” Hoyer said, without giving specifics.Hoyer said Democrats will have to work with Republicans to get the wage hike passed, because right now there are not 60 votes in the Senate for boosting the minimum wage. Democrats and their allies have 50 votes in the Senate.“We’re going to send that over to the Senate, and hope ... there are 10 (Republican) senators who believe that having people work for $7.25 an hour and in poverty after 40 hours of workweek is not right in America,” he said.",Reuters

But she refused to commit to keeping telecommunications company Huawei Technologies on a U.S. economic blacklist.The Commerce Department under former President Donald Trump took aim at China on numerous fronts, adding dozens of Chinese companies to a trade blacklist, including Huawei, the country’s top chipmaker SMIC, Hikvision and drone manufacturer SZ DJI Technology.In written responses to lawmakers, Raimondo said she had “no reason to believe” that the listed Chinese companies should not be.“We should have no illusions about China’s objectives, which I believe are to undercut America’s longstanding technological advantage and to displace America as the global leader in cutting-edge research and development and the industries of the future,” she said.Raimondo inherits the Trump administration’s unsuccessful effort to bar U.S. app stores run by Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google from offering Chinese-owned TikTok or WeChat for download. The Justice Department last month put appeals of rulings blocking those efforts on hold pending a Biden administration review of the efforts.",Reuters
923,"Court lifts restrictions on Uber Eats Italy after working conditions investigation
A Milan court on Thursday lifted restrictions on the management of an Italian unit of Uber Technologies, imposed last year as part of an investigation into possible exploitation of food delivery riders, a court document showed.

He would not say how much they are now paid.“Uber Italy ... can now present itself on the food delivery market with a new management model that is uniquely geared towards promoting transparency and legality,” the court document said.Uber Italy was placed under so-called judicial supervision in May 2020 while magistrates looked into a case involving around 1,000 delivery riders who were allegedly paid three euros per hour to deliver meals.A company put under judicial supervision can continue to operate but is run by court-appointed administrators instead of its usual management team. The administrators have to send regular reports to the judges.Uber Italy said at the time that it had made its Uber Eats platform available to restaurants and couriers in full respect of the law and it condemned any form of illegal intermediation.“Today’s decision is the result of several months of hard work in which we have strived to provide couriers with a safe, rewarding and flexible working environment,” Uber Italy said in an e-mailed statement on Thursday, adding it would continue to collaborate with the authorities.On Wednesday a Milan prosecutor had asked the court to revoke the judicial supervision, saying Uber Italy had met the conditions requested.In a separate case, Uber Eats Italy was also among four food delivery companies that last month were forced by the Milan public prosecutor’s office to hire more than 60,000 riders following an investigation into the working conditions of riders.",Reuters

A spokeswoman for the IFT also declined to comment.While the ruling does not change the status quo for America Movil, it is a setback for the giant’s ongoing battle to shake off the restrictions imposed by the reform, industry experts said.“It’s a significant defeat for America Movil and Carlos Slim ... all the restrictions stay in place,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics.It could also pave the way for the IFT to impose more restrictions aimed at trimming back its power and making it easier for rivals to enter the market.“It might free up the IFT to be more forceful in insisting that America Movil act to reduce its market share below 50% by further sharing infrastructure or making other concessions to rivals,” said Andrew Paxman, a business historian at Mexico’s Economic Research and Teaching Center (CIDE).",Reuters

He said he never physically touched anyone.New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday said she had accepted the governor’s formal referral of the matter to her office, clearing the way for appointment of an outside counsel to conduct an investigation into the accounts of both women - Lindsey Boylan and Charlotte Bennett.Late on Monday, a third woman, Anna Ruch, came forward in an interview published by the New York Times to accuse the governor of inappropriate conduct at a September 2019 wedding reception.As reported by the Times, Ruch recounted the governor first put his hand on her bare lower back, then when she brushed his hand away, called her “aggressive” and placed his hands on her cheeks and asked her if he could kiss her.Ruch, according to the Times, said she pulled away and the encounter left her feeling “confused and shocked and embarrassed.” The moment was caught in a cellphone photo Ruch said was taken by a friend and published by the Times with the article.Reuters was unable to independently verify Ruch’s account. Attempts to reach her were unsuccessful. A representative for Cuomo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The New York governor’s brother, CNN host Chris Cuomo, told viewers late on Monday he could not cover stories surrounding the allegations on the governor due their relation.“Obviously, I’m aware of what’s going on with my brother,” the CNN host said on Monday. “Obviously, I cannot cover it because he is my brother. Now, of course CNN has to cover it. They have covered it extensively and they will continue to do so.”The often outspoken governor has stayed mostly out of the public eye since the sexual harassment scandal started gaining traction last week. Cuomo rose to national prominence for his daily televised briefings last spring, when New York was the epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.In January, the attorney general’s office issued a report that cast doubt on the Cuomo administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying the state health department significantly undercounted the death toll in nursing homes and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.Before entering private practice, Abramowitz worked as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, where he served as chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney’s office.Abramowitz represented Cuomo’s office when federal prosecutors investigated the governor for disbanding an anti-corruption agency in 2014.

Biden’s fellow Democrats have a majority in the House, but the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate, where the measure would need support from all 50 members of that party caucus, plus 10 Republicans.Republicans have said the law would take powers away from states and raise fraud concerns.Democrats have been fighting to expand access to the polls through early voting, vote-by-mail and other measures, efforts that expanded as the coronavirus pandemic raged.Republicans have been fighting those efforts and pursuing measures to curb access to the polls. Former President Donald Trump, in his first public speech after his stinging Nov. 3 election loss to Biden, on Sunday proposed limiting absentee voting and days when Americans can vote.Biden beat Trump by more than 7 million votes in the 2020 presidential election. Democrats enjoy an advantage over Republicans in voter party affiliation.Trump never conceded the loss, and some of his supporters violently contested Congress’ certification of Biden’s win at the Capitol in a deadly Jan. 6 riot.Since then, dozens of local Republican lawmakers have introduced bills that would limit voting in states across the country.Georgia’s House of Representatives on Monday approved a bill that restricts ballot drop boxes and limits early voting on Sundays, curtailing traditional “Souls to the Polls” voter turnout programs in Black churches. If passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate and signed into law by Republican Governor Brian Kemp, the measure could be devastating for Black voters, activists have said.A fight is also brewing over the forthcoming redrawing of a map that determines which areas of the country are represented by which House member. In many states that process is led by state legislatures, which are mostly controlled by Republicans.Legislatures have historically redrawn the borders in ways that helped their party win more elections, sometimes minimizing the influence of Black voters.The House bill would turn much of that authority over to commissions that Republicans have said would not be accountable to citizens in their states.",Reuters
935,Senate to debate COVID-19 bill this week after Democrats retreat on minimum wage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/senate-to-debate-covid-19-bill-this-week-after-democrats-retreat-on-minimum-wage-idUSKCN2AT228,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will start debating President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill this week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday after Democrats backed down from an effort to raise the minimum wage to $15 as part of it.The backpedaling did not end hopes of addressing the minimum wage issue in Congress. Democrats and some Republicans have voiced support for the idea of raising the federal minimum wage, now at $7.25 an hour, for the first time since 2009, although they disagree on how much.Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton last week proposed an increase to $10 per hour, but said employers should verify the wage is going to workers who are legally in the United States.The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives early on Saturday narrowly approved the COVID-19 package, one of Biden’s top priorities. The House bill included the minimum wage hike.Democrats aim to pass the legislation in the Senate trough a maneuver known as “reconciliation,” which would allow the bill to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes normally required by that chamber’s rules.Senate debate on the COVID-19 bill could begin as early as Wednesday, a Senate Democratic aide said.Senate Democrats over the weekend gave up on the idea of trying to pass the minimum wage hike by adding tax penalties to the COVID-19 bill, after earlier being told that Senate rules governing “reconciliation” prevented them including a straight-up wage hike to the legislation.There are also political hurdles. Some moderate Democrats, including Senator Joe Manchin, have rejected the $15 figure as too high and suggested an $11 target could be more realistic.“We worked through the weekend and it became clear that finalizing ‘plan B’ with the caucus would delay passage and risk going over the jobless benefits cliff on March 14,” one source said. Democrats want the COVID-19 bill signed into law by March 14, when enhanced unemployment benefits expire.A group of House progressives urged Biden on Monday to overrule the Senate parliamentarian, who determined last week that the $15 proposal could not pass by reconciliation.“This ruling is a bridge too far,” said Democratic Representative Ro Khanna. “If we don’t overrule the Senate parliamentarian, we are condoning poverty wages for millions of Americans.”The White House has previously ruled out intervening.Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said on Monday night he would introduce an amendment to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 in the final reconciliation bill, adding he believed the Senate should ignore the parliamentarian’s advice.“I am not sure, however, that my view at this point is the majority view in the Democratic Caucus,” Sanders said in a statement.The Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, told reporters that lawmakers should look for another venue to raise the minimum wage, but that “if it takes some 60 votes or a supermajority of some kind, it’s going to be very difficult, obviously.”To pass the relief plan, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris may have to cast a tie-breaking vote in a chamber where Republicans control 50 seats and Democrats and their allies control the other 50. Even that outcome depends on all the Democrats staying united behind the first major bill to come through Congress in the Biden administration.Democrats say the package is needed to fight a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Biden met with nine Senate Democrats on the coronavirus relief bill on Monday. One of them, Senator Jon Tester, told reporters they discussed “targeting” the funds in the legislation.“At least from my perspective, it wasn’t talking about reducing it, just targeting the money,” said Tester.Republicans in Congress, who broadly backed COVID-19 relief spending early in the pandemic, say the relief plan is too expensive and includes things like transportation projects that have nothing to do with relief for COVID-19. They also do not like the $35 billion included for pumping up government subsidies to defray the cost of premiums in the Obamacare health insurance program.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced the measure on Monday as a “bonanza of partisan spending” that poorly targets the needs of American families, devotes only 1% of its spending to vaccines, delays the bulk of its school aid until after 2021 and includes policies that would drag down the economy.“This is where we are: a bad process, a bad bill, and a missed opportunity to do right by working families,” McConnell said in a Senate floor speech.The Democratic measure includes funding to track the virus and distribute vaccines, and sends a new round of aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments.The big-ticket items include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, a $400-per-week federal unemployment benefit through Aug. 29 and help for those in difficulty paying rents and home mortgages during the pandemic.",Reuters

They further argued that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland had also waded into the debate, proving politicization of Meng’s case.Meng, 49, was arrested on a U.S. warrant for bank fraud at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 and has since been living under house arrest while fighting extradition. She faces charges of bank fraud in the United States over misleading HSBC about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd’s business dealings in Iran, causing the bank to violate U.S. sanctions. She has said she is innocent.Ten days after Meng's arrest, then-President Trump told Reuters in an interview that he would intervene in the case if it would help get a better trade deal with China. here“With that utterance Ms. Meng became a bargaining chip in this economic contest between these two superpowers,” defence lawyer Richard Peck said. “Our contention is that his words amount to an abuse of process.”Canadian prosecutors have said Trump’s statements are no longer relevant since he has left office and the trade deal has already been signed.Defence lawyer Isabel Schurman said that position was untenable.“There has been no change in circumstance,” Schurman told the court, calling it “irrelevant” that the person who holds the office of U.S. president has changed.Diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing broke down in the wake of Meng’s 2018 arrest. Days later, China detained two Canadians on espionage charges, which Canada viewed as retaliation.Biden said last month, in reference to the case and ensuing diplomatic conflict, “human beings are not bargaining chips.”Peck said the comment did not adequately repudiate the remarks of the previous president.“It’s too late,” he said. “The harm has been done and has existed for two years.”Defence lawyer Mona Duckett cited comments by Freeland that the United States should not “seek to politicize the extradition process,” following Trump’s comments, to support the claim of political interference in the case.Duckett also pointed to Trudeau’s December 2019 comment that the United States should not sign a final trade agreement with China without resolving the dispute over the two Canadians detained by China after Meng’s arrest.Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater said the quotes referenced by the defence were out of context and that the defence had ignored the presumption of good faith and inferred the worst.“That is not a fair way to look at this case,” he said.Earlier on Wednesday, China’s ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, said Canada should move quickly to release Meng to help restore relations between the two countries. “That will help to put our relationship back on the normal track,” Cong said in a virtual news conference on Twitter, repeating that China’s arrest of Canadians was not linked to the Meng case.Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday that at the time, Chinese officials made it clear that the arrest of the two Canadians was in response to Meng.“Nothing the ambassador can say now will dissuade me from understanding that is indeed the case,” he said.Meng’s case is scheduled to finish hearings in May.",Reuters

938,"ASML extends sales deal with Chinese chipmaker SMIC to end of 2021
ASML Holding NV has extended a deal to sell chip manufacturing equipment to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's largest chipmaker, until the end of this year, the Dutch company said in a statement on Wednesday.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asml-holding-smic/asml-extends-sales-deal-with-chinese-chipmaker-smic-to-end-of-2021-idUSKBN2AV1S6,"(Reuters) - ASML Holding NV has extended a deal to sell chip manufacturing equipment to Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China’s largest chipmaker, until the end of this year, the Dutch company said in a statement on Wednesday.ASML made the statement after SMIC on Wednesday disclosed a volume purchase agreement under which it has already spent $1.2 billion with the toolmaker. In a clarifying statement issued several hours later, ASML said the agreement began in 2018 and was slated to expire at the end of 2020, but the two companies agreed in February to extend the deal to the end of this year.In December, SMIC was one of dozens of firms put on a U.S. blacklist that required American semiconductor manufacturing equipment firms such as Applied Materials Inc and Lam Research Corp to obtain a license before exporting products to the chipmaker.The U.S. Commerce Department said the action against SMIC stemmed from China’s efforts to harness civilian technologies for military purposes and evidence of activities between SMIC and Chinese military industrial companies of concern. The rules would still allow the shipment of tools for making less advanced chips.ASML, which is based in the Netherlands and is the world’s largest supplier of lithography equipment for making chips, produces a critical tool required to manufacture advanced chips: an extreme ultraviolet lithography, or EUV, machine.In 2019, the Trump administration pressed Dutch officials to cancel a sale of an EUV machine to SMIC. At that time, Dutch officials declined to renew a license needed to ship the tool. Dutch officials had not approved a license to ship an EUV tool to China as of late February, according to government records.In its statement on Wednesday, ASML said the volume purchase deal with SMIC related to an older technology called deep ultraviolet lithography, or DUV.In January, ASML Chief Executive Peter Wennik said the company could see “significant upside” selling older chipmaking technology to China if allowed by government officials to do so. China accounted for 17% of ASML’s 14 billion euros in 2020 sales.On Monday, the U.S. National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, or NSCAI, recommended that the United States coordinate with the Netherlands and Japan to deny export licenses to China for key chipmaking equipment.“This (sale) is a slap in the face to the NSCAI recommendations and shows how big the gap with allies is on these issue,” a U.S. semiconductor executive said on condition of anonymity.A source close to President Joe Biden’s administration, however, said the administration was more focused on the next wave of technological competition with China.“This is akin to trying to prevent them from getting a flip-phone. We’re much more interested in the technologies of tomorrow,” the person said.",Reuters

Germany's financial watchdog warned of ""an imminent risk"" that Greensill Bank would become over-indebted on Wednesday as it imposed a moratorium on the lender making disposals or payments.

The loans, which typically have maturities of up to 90 days, are securitized and sold to investors, allowing Greensill to make new loans.Greensill’s primary source of funding came to an abrupt halt this week when Credit Suisse and asset manager GAM Holdings AG suspended redemptions from funds which held most of their around $10 billion in assets in Greensill notes, over concerns about being able to accurately value them.Two sources told Reuters on Wednesday that SoftBank-backed Greensill Capital is preparing to file for insolvency, adding that the sale talks were with U.S. private equity firm Apollo.Greensill and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Greensill’s insolvency preparations, which were earlier reported by the Financial Times, or on the sale talks.Japan’s SoftBank, which has invested $1.5 billion in recent years in Greensill, also declined to comment.BaFin said an audit found that Greensill Bank could not provide evidence of receivables on its balance sheet purchased from mining tycoon Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance. GFG did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on BaFin’s findings.“The moratorium had to be ordered to secure the assets in an orderly procedure,” BaFin said in a statement, adding that the Bremen-based bank would be closed for business with customers. It declined to elaborate.Greensill Capital said in a statement that Greensill Bank always “seeks external legal and audit advice before booking any new asset.”Greensill Bank had loans outstanding of 2.8 billion euros and deposits of 3.3 billion euros at the end of 2019, rating agency Scope said in an October report, which did not detail the bank’s exposure to GFG.The bank is a member of the Compensation Scheme of German Banks which means deposits up to 100,000 euros ($120,740) are protected. The German regulator said withdrawals were not currently possible, but gave no further detail in a statement.Prosecutors in Bremen said earlier they had received a criminal complaint from BaFin regarding Greensill Bank, but did not provide further details on it.In Britain, meanwhile the financial regulator took action against GFG’s own trade finance arm Wyelands Bank. The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority said it had ordered Wyelands to repay all its depositors. It said in a statement that it had been engaging closely with Wyelands, but did not say why it had taken the action.GFG said Wyelands, which had over 700 million pounds ($979 million) of deposits according to its latest annual report, would repay deposits and planned to “focus solely on business advisory and connected finance”.A GFG spokesman declined to comment on the BoE statement.Credit Suisse said on Wednesday it is looking to return cash from its suspended funds dedicated to supply chain finance, which is a method by which companies can get cash from banks and funds such as Greensill Capital to pay their suppliers without having to dip into their working capital.“Given the significant amount of cash (and cash equivalents) in the funds, we are exploring mechanisms for distributing excess cash to investors,” Credit Suisse said in a note to investors on its website.Credit Suisse said that more than 1,000 institutional or professional investors were invested across its funds.($1 = 0.8282 euros)($1 = 0.7153 pounds)",Reuters

U.S. conservatives praised Donald Trump at an annual gathering on Friday, even unveiling a golden statue of the former president, showing he remains a Republican political force despite violent scenes in Washington last month.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-conservatives/with-gold-colored-trump-statue-conservatives-show-fealty-to-former-president-idUSKBN2AQ1GZ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. conservatives praised Donald Trump at an annual gathering on Friday, even unveiling a golden statue of the former president, showing he remains a Republican political force despite violent scenes in Washington last month.Prominent congressional conservatives - including Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley and Representatives Steve Scalise and Matt Gaetz - were among the Trump loyalists speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, which the former president will address on Sunday.“Let me tell you something: Donald Trump ain’t going anywhere,” said Cruz.Trump’s tumultuous final weeks in office saw his supporters launch a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an attempt to block Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden’s election victory, a win that Trump falsely claimed was tainted by widespread fraud.If there was any doubt that CPAC this year was devoted to Trump, the gold-colored statue of the former president, dressed in a jacket, red tie and Stars-and-Stripes boxing shorts, was on display at the conference site.Two participants wheeled the larger-than-life statue through the conference center lobby, according to a video on social media. It was unclear why the statue, showing a cartoonish version of Trump with an oversize head, was there.The statue drew instant derision online, with commentators comparing it to the golden calf that enraged the prophet Moses in the Old Testament.“Idol worship isn’t conservative. #RestoreOurGop,” Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 attack, said on Twitter.Gaetz declared himself part of the “pro-Trump, America First” wing of the conservative movement. “We’re not really a wing, we’re the whole body,” he said.He also appeared to forecast a future role for Trump, who is pondering another run for president in 2024: “Trump may not have drained the swamp all the way – yet.”U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican who may run for the party’s presidential nomination in 2024, sought to thread the needle between pledging loyalty to Trump and signaling his aspirations for higher office.He said “President Trump has flaws” but that he had made the party more approachable for working-class Americans.“We will not win the future by going back to where the Republican Party used to be,” Scott said. “If we do, we will lose the working base that President Trump so animated. We’re going to lose elections across the country and ultimately we’re going to lose our nation.”‘NOT THE PAST’Hawley, another possible 2024 candidate, called himself part of the future of the party.“We’re not the past, we’re the future. We represent the future of this country,” he said.Trump is expected to talk on Sunday about the future of the party and lay out policy differences within a group riven by differences in the wake of his chaotic four years in office.“The divide right now is between the ‘Beltway elites’ and the conservative grassroots around the country,” said a Trump adviser who helped prepare the speech.Trump will also offer red-meat rhetoric critical of his successor, Democrat President Joe Biden.Trump supporters at the conference on Friday repeated some of his false claims, arguing that they justified new restrictions on voting.In addition to the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, seven Senate Republicans voted to convict him of inciting insurrection, although the 57-43 vote fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict.Many other senior Republicans did not attend this year’s event. They included former Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Representative Liz Cheney - another House Republican who voted to impeach.Some advisers say they want Trump not to use his speech to relitigate the election at length but instead offer a road map to Republicans’ regaining control of the House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2022 congressional elections.CPAC is an event organized by the American Conservative Union, whose chairman, Matt Schlapp, is close to Trump. It is a prime venue for speakers who want to gauge interest in whether they should run for president based on the enthusiasm they generate.",Reuters
947,Cuomo calls for outside review after second former aide alleges sexual misconduct,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-cuomo/cuomo-calls-for-outside-review-after-second-former-aide-alleges-sexual-misconduct-idUSKCN2AS028,"(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called on Saturday for an outside review following a report of sexual misconduct allegations against him by a second former aide, compounding problems for one of America’s most well-known Democratic politicians.Charlotte Bennett told the New York Times that Cuomo had asked her questions about her sex life, including whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men.Cuomo, in a statement, denied making sexual advances.Reuters has not independently verified the account and accusations by Bennett. She worked for the governor as an executive assistant and policy advisor for nearly two years until November 2020, according to her LinkedIn profile.“I was trying to be a mentor to her. I never made advances toward Ms. Bennett nor did I ever intend to act in any way that was inappropriate,” Cuomo said in a statement on Saturday.He called for “a full and thorough outside review” led by a former federal judge and said he would have no further comment until it was completed.Bennett did not immediately return a request for comment sent via Twitter.Cuomo rose to national prominence for his leadership at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when New York was the country’s COVID-19 epicenter.The latest accusations came just days after another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, wrote in an online essay that the governor made several “inappropriate gestures” toward her while she worked for the state government from 2015 to 2018.They ranged from sending her a rose on Valentine’s Day to kissing her on the mouth, she said.Boylan is now a candidate for Manhattan borough president.Cuomo denied those accusations in December and issued another denial this week. Multiple attempts to reach Boylan have been unsuccessful.Bennett, who is 25, told the Times that Cuomo said to her in one encounter in June that he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.Bennett said she discussed the interaction with Cuomo’s chief of staff Jill DesRosiers and was subsequently transferred to a job as a health policy advisor to the governor. She also provided a statement to a special counsel to the governor, Judith Mogul, in June, she told the Times.Beth Garvey, special counsel and senior advisor to Cuomo, said in a statement that Bennett had been “consulted regarding the resolution, and expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the way in which it was handled.”“The determination reached based on the information Ms Bennett provided was that no further action was required which was consistent with Ms Bennett’s wishes,” Garvey said.Allegations about his conduct with female aides follow another major controversy that has dogged Cuomo in recent weeks.A report from the state attorney general’s office last month cast doubt on the Cuomo administration’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis in nursing homes, saying that the state health department significantly undercounted the toll and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.A top aide to Cuomo later told lawmakers the administration had delayed providing requested data about COVID-19 death toll among nursing home residents for fear of a politically motivated investigation by the Justice Department under the then-president, Republican Donald Trump.",Reuters
948,Biden scores legislative win as House passes $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/biden-scores-legislative-win-as-house-passes-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-plan-idUSKBN2AQ1FT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden scored his first legislative win as the House of Representatives passed his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package early Saturday, though Democrats face challenges to their hopes of using the bill to raise the minimum wage.Democrats who control the chamber passed the sweeping measure by a mostly party-line vote of 219 to 212 and sent it on to the Senate, where Democrats planned a legislative maneuver to allow them to pass it without the support of Republicans.The American Rescue Plan would pay for vaccines and medical supplies and send a new round of emergency financial aid to households, small businesses and state and local governments. The bill’s big-ticket items include $1,400 direct payments to individuals, a $400-per-week federal unemployment benefit through Aug. 29, and help for those in difficulty paying rents and home mortgages during the pandemic.In brief remarks on Saturday from the White House’s Roosevelt Room, Biden said he called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to thank her for her support and urged the Senate to take up the bill quickly.“I hope it will receive quick action. We have no time to waste,” Biden said, without taking questions. “The people of this country have suffered far too much for far too long.”Democrats said the package was needed to fight a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.“The American people need to know that their government is there for them,” Pelosi said in a debate on the House floor.Republicans, who have broadly backed previous COVID-19 spending, said much of the current package was not necessary, highlighting elements such as a subway near Pelosi’s San Francisco district. Only 9% of the total would go directly toward fighting the virus, they said.“It just throws out money without accountability,” House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said.Democrats pointed to a recent Quinnipiac University poll showing 68% of Americans supported the package, including 47% of Republicans, with just 37% of Republicans opposing it.“This critical legislation has support from Americans across the country and the political spectrum, and yet Republicans in Congress are trying to stand in the way,” said Jamie Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.The House vote amounted to a successful first test for Democrats, who hold a narrow 221-211 majority in the chamber. Progressives and moderates in the party who are often at odds will face tougher battles ahead on immigration and climate change initiatives that Biden wants to push.The president has focused his first weeks in office on tackling the greatest U.S. public health crisis in a century, which has upended most aspects of American life.Democrats aim to get the bill to him to sign into law before mid-March, when enhanced unemployment benefits and some other types of aid are due to expire.The action now moves to the Senate, where Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris may have to cast a tie-breaking vote in a chamber where Republicans control 50 seats and Democrats and their allies control the other 50.Democrats will have to sort out how to handle a proposed minimum-wage increase, which may have to be stripped from the bill due to the complicated rules that govern the Senate.The House-passed bill would raise the national hourly minimum wage for the first time since 2009, to $15 from $7.25. The increase is a top priority for progressive Democrats.However, the Senate’s rules expert said on Thursday that the wage hike did not qualify for special treatment that allows the rest of the bill to be passed with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the 100-seat chamber.Pelosi predicted the relief bill will pass Congress with or without the increase, and said Democrats would not give up on the matter.It is not clear whether the minimum-wage hike would have survived the Senate even if it were to be kept in the bill. At least two Senate Democrats oppose it, along with most Republicans.Some senators are floating a smaller increase, to the range of $10 to $12 per hour, while Democrats are considering a penalty for large corporations that do not voluntarily pay a $15 wage, according to a Democratic aide.Efforts to craft a bipartisan coronavirus aid bill fizzled early on, shortly after Biden was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, following a series of bipartisan bills enacted in 2020.",Reuters

If you see yourself as an artist, then you are an artist,” Maezawa said.The first stage of the selection process runs to March 14, with applicants needing to pass medical checks and, eventually, an interview with Maezawa.The entrepreneur, who sold his online fashion business Zozo Inc to SoftBank in 2019, is paying the entire cost of the voyage on SpaceX’s next-generation reusable launch vehicle, dubbed the Starship.“I thought there might be delays but everything is on schedule,” said Maezawa in an interview.Two recent Starship prototypes have exploded during testing, underscoring the risks for Maezawa, 45, and his fellow passengers, who must also contend with the strains of space travel in the first private journey beyond Earth’s orbit.“Elon Musk says there is no problem and I believe him,” said Maezawa. SpaceX ferried four astronauts to the International Space Station in November on its Falcon 9 rocket.Maezawa said he is not in training - which he expects to take a few months at most - but is watching his alcohol intake and exercising while spending a few hours a week considering the mission.“I’m only preparing mentally,” said the fashion guru, wearing a Dior shirt over a T-shirt depicting the iconic 1968 Earthrise photo.Seeing the whole Earth and the far side of the moon would be highlights of the trip, said Maezawa, who had considered a trip the ISS before choosing the more ambitious moon voyage.“This mission we expect people will go further than any human has ever gone from Planet Earth,” Musk said, days after SpaceX completed its latest $850 million fundraising, which has helped turn the businessman into one of the world’s richest people.Costs for the trip remain in line with the original contract with SpaceX, said Maezawa, who has declined to say how much that is, but says is more than his $110 million purchase of a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting.Both Musk and Maezawa have built loyal followings on social media, with the latter’s cash giveaways helping to make him Japan’s most-followed Twitter account.Maezawa, who recently introduced SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son to audio app Clubhouse, said he plans to feature mission preparation on his YouTube channel, which also offers videos of him playing golf in Hawaii and racing supercars.Last year he launched a short-lived documentary search for a new girlfriend to join him on the trip before pulling out citing “mixed feelings.”",Reuters

Newly-formed Stellantis, a combination of Peugeot-maker PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), wants to use its clout to take on rivals racing to produce more electric vehicles, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Wednesday.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stellantis-results/no-dinosaur-carmaker-stellantis-steps-up-electric-ambitions-idUSKBN2AV0UE,"MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - Newly-formed Stellantis, a combination of Peugeot-maker PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA), wants to use its clout to take on rivals racing to produce more electric vehicles, Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said on Wednesday.Stellantis is now the world’s fourth largest carmaker, with 14 brands including Opel, Jeep, Ram and Maserati, and like its peers, it is grappling with a shortage of semiconductors and investments in electric vehicles.Low global car inventories and cost cuts should help boost profit margins this year, though the carmaker is also looking beyond savings, Tavares said.“This is not a crisis merger,” he told an analyst conference, after Stellantis forecast higher profitability for 2021 and PSA and Fiat which merged in January reported better-than-expected results for 2020.“This is a merger that is going to open new opportunities for a company that is sound, with talented people ... who do not want to be cornered in a legacy or a dinosaur position.”Stellantis aims to deliver over 5 billion euros a year in savings through the merger, as well as bulking up to face industry challenges.Automakers are racing to develop electric vehicles to meet tighter CO2 emissions targets in Europe and this week Volvo joined a growing number of carmakers aiming for a fully-electric line-up by 2030.Stellantis plans to have fully-electric or hybrid versions of all of its vehicles available in Europe by 2025, broadly in line with plans at top rivals such as Volkswagen and Renault-Nissan, although Stellantis has further to go to meet that goal.The group said 2021 results should be helped by three new high-margin Jeep vehicles in North America and a strong pricing environment there. The U.S. market has driven profits for years at FCA and starts off as the strongest part of Stellantis.The carmaker is targeting an adjusted operating profit margin of 5.5%-7.5% this year.That compares with a 5.3% aggregated margin last year: 4.3% at FCA and 7.1% at PSA excluding a controlling stake in parts maker Faurecia, which is set to be spun-off from Stellantis shortly.Tavares said he did not consider the guidance to be cautious. It assumes no more significant lockdowns caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, but the executive warned of other headwinds including the rising price of raw materials.The industry is being squeezed by a COVID-19-related global shortage of semiconductors, used for everything from maximising engine fuel economy to driver-assistance features.Tavares said the problems might not be fully resolved by the second half of 2021, as some auto rivals have flagged, describing supplies as the “big unknown” for revenues in 2021.The group is now working through reorganising some of its factory set-ups, though it has pledged to close no plants, and finalising new management teams.Priorities for 2021 will also include defining a strategy for China, Tavares said, where some Stellantis brands have struggled more than rivals.Tavares, who previously ran PSA, achieved an improvement in margins at the French carmaker by cutting costs, simplifying its vehicle line-up and delivering synergies on its purchase of Opel/Vauxhall, a strategy investors hope he can replicate.Combined adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) amounted to 7.1 billion euros ($8.6 billion) at the group last year. At the end of 2020, combined liquidity stood at 57.4 billion euros and free cash flow at 3.3 billion euros.Stellantis is planning a capital markets day for late 2021 or early 2022.

957,"GM extends production cuts due to chip shortage, Stellantis warns of lingering pain
The global semiconductor chip shortage led General Motors Co on Wednesday to extend production cuts at three North American plants and add a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Stellantis to warn the pain could linger far into the year.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-semiconductors-exclusive/gm-extends-production-cuts-due-to-chip-shortage-stellantis-warns-of-lingering-pain-idUSKBN2AV1QS,"DETROIT/LONDON (Reuters) - The global semiconductor chip shortage led General Motors Co on Wednesday to extend production cuts at three North American plants and add a fourth to the list of factories hit, and Stellantis to warn the pain could linger far into the year.The extended cuts do not change GM’s forecast last month that the shortage could shave up to $2 billion from this year’s earnings. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson subsequently said chip supplies should return to normal rates by the second half of the year and he was confident the profit hit would not worsen.However, Stellantis on Wednesday did not give an estimate for the financial hit it expects this year from the shortage and said the issue could last into the second half of 2021.The chip shortage, which has hit automakers globally, stems from a confluence of factors as carmakers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tight chip supplies. They also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies.GM did not disclose the impact on volumes or say which supplier or parts were affected by the chip shortage, but the U.S. automaker said it intends to recover as much of the lost output as possible.“GM continues to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including full-size trucks and SUVs,” GM spokesman David Barnas said. “We contemplated this downtime when we discussed our outlook for 2021.”GM said it would extend downtime at plants in Fairfax, Kansas, and Ingersoll, Ontario, to at least mid-April, and in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, through the end of March. In addition, it will idle its Gravatai plant in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in April and May.The Detroit automaker had previously extended production cuts at three North American plants into mid-March and said vehicles at two other plants would only be partially built. Following Wednesday’s cuts, forecasting firm AutoForecast Solutions estimated GM could lose more than 216,000 units globally due to the shortage.While reporting quarterly results on Wednesday, Stellantis said the chip shortage could weigh on 2021 earnings and Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer told analysts on a conference call the financial impact was a “big unknown.”Stellantis Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said the automaker was working hard to find alternative chip supplies, but he was “not so sure” the issue would be resolved by the second half of 2021.Ford Motor Co said last month the lack of chips could cut company production by up to 20% in the first quarter and hurt profits by as much as $2.5 billion. It had previously cut production of its top-selling F-150 pickup truck.Some automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co, avoided deeper cuts by stockpiling chips ahead of the shortage.Industry officials and politicians have pushed U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration to take a more active role in dealing with the chip shortage.Last week, Biden said he would seek $37 billion in funding to supercharge chip manufacturing in the United States. An executive order also launched a review of supply chains for such critical products as semiconductor chips, electric vehicle batteries and rare earth minerals.Complicating matters was a severe winter storm in Texas last month that killed at least 21 people and led to the shutdown of several chip plants. Semiconductor industry officials said customers would face knock-on effects in several months.",Reuters

Elrond plans to hold a new round of financing in 6-12 months to increase users, Mincu said.“While it has started in the native digital area it will expand,” Mincu said.“Maiar is the simplest app for people to interact with blockchain technology and can pave the way to building the infrastructure for a new transparent financial system with wide bandwidth and very low latency.”(This story corrects name of Elrond’s currency in para 6)",Reuters
959,"Analysis: Urban states come out ahead, rural states get less in Biden's COVID-19 relief bill
(This Feb. 24 story refiles to reflect Democratic-leaning states in paragraph 2)",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-states-analysi/analysis-urban-states-come-out-ahead-rural-states-get-less-in-bidens-covid-19-relief-bill-idUSKBN2AO183,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package now making its way through the U.S. Congress would provide $350 billion to help pandemic-hit state and local governments balance their budgets, more than twice the amount lawmakers approved last year.But not every state comes out ahead: urban, Democratic-led states like Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts that took drastic steps to stop the coronavirus’ spread would get about three times as much money per person as they did in the package passed at the beginning of the health crisis in March.Rural, Republican-led states including Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota that did less would see less cash.That’s because Congress is giving greater weight to poverty and unemployment this time as it considers how to distribute money to keep police, firefighters and other public employees on the job during a pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.It also reflects the fact that Democrats who control both chambers of Congress drafted the package for their fellow Democrat President Joe Biden without Republican input.Under the new bill, named the American Rescue Plan, 61% of the aid would end up in states that voted for Biden in November, up from 56% in the bipartisan CARES Act passed last March.Reuters examined House Oversight Committee projections on how much direct fiscal aid each state would receive in the bill, which is set for a vote in the House of Representatives this week before moving to the Senate.It is expected to pass, even if no Republicans vote for it.The CARES Act distributed $140 billion to state and local governments based on population, delivering a minimum of $1.25 billion to each state. That gave the largest per-capita benefits to the states with the smallest populations, including Wyoming and Vermont. Another $3 billion was set aside for Washington, D.C., and U.S. territories.This time around, Democrats have lowered the per-state minimum to $500 million. The remaining $300 billion would be allocated based on unemployment and poverty levels as well as population. Tribal governments and territories would get $24.5 billion. Washington, D.C., would be treated like a state.Advocates say the new formula ensures the money goes where it is needed, as COVID-19’s toll has been uneven across the country. Unemployment in December topped 9% in tourism-dependent Nevada and Hawaii, triple the 3% in Nebraska and South Dakota.“This is a more targeted approach,” said Michael Leachman, a budget expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who supports additional state and local aid.Republicans say the bill short-changes states that have imposed fewer coronavirus-related restrictions.“The real reason for this bill is to send billions to bail out blue-state governors and reward their harmful lockdown policies,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri said at a House Budget Committee hearing on Monday.The new bill would direct roughly $800 per person to Republican-led Utah and Alabama, which had some of the least restrictive COVID-19 responses, according to Oxford University researchers.It would send roughly $1,200 per person to Democratic-led Massachusetts and New York, among the most restrictive.Democrats argue that the money should be targeted towards areas that have suffered the most.“Since when is unemployment not a legitimate indicator of economic distress?” Representative David Price, a Democrat from North Carolina, said at the same hearing.State and local aid has proven to be one of the most divisive aspects of the multi-trillion dollar effort Washington has mounted in the past year to fight the virus and keep the world’s largest economy afloat.Republicans and Democrats both broadly supported small-business loans and direct payments to families.But Republicans have balked at providing more aid to state and local governments. State and local aid was excluded from a bipartisan $900 billion bill that passed in December.The National Association of State Budget Officers calculated state revenues would drop 10.8% in the current fiscal year when compared with pre-pandemic estimates, affecting Republican-led and Democratic-led states alike.Some analysts say the Democrats’ proposal, which adds up to about $500 billion when spending for public schools, transit and other aid is included, provides states with more than they need, however.“People dramatically overestimated how bad the state and local finances would be,” Stan Veuger, an economist at the center-right American Enterprise Institute.Bipartisan groups like the National Governors Association have argued that further aid is needed to help states deliver health care and education and avoid further layoffs that could prolong the recovery, though they have not endorsed specific proposals.Though the new bill would steer more money towards large states, smaller states still fare well. Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska and North Dakota, each with fewer than 1 million residents, are still among the top 10 recipients on a per capita basis.",Reuters

They included the increase in his coronavirus relief bill to help tackle the heavy human and economic toll of the pandemic, which has killed more than 500,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work.Democrats are trying to advance the COVID-19 bill under a special “budget reconciliation” process that would allow them to pass it in the Senate using a simple majority, so they will not need Republican support.But there are rules that limit what can be included using that process, and it is the job of Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough to determine what is allowed.“This decision reinforces reconciliation cannot be used as a vehicle to pass major legislative change - by either party - on a simple majority vote,” Graham wrote on Twitter.The negative ruling does not mean the idea of raising the minimum wage is dead. Proponents could seek to pass a separate bill without using the reconciliation process, but they presumably would need Republican support.Two Senate Republicans, Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney, on Tuesday proposed increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour.Not all Democrats favor a $15 wage. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, has suggested raising the wage to $11 over two years.The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. It was last raised in 2009.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said after the Senate parliamentarian’s ruling that the $15 minimum wage would be still included when the Democratic-controlled chamber takes up the relief bill on Friday.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday showed 59% of respondents saying they supported raising the minimum wage to $15, with 34% opposed.",Reuters

Elrond plans to hold a new round of financing in 6-12 months to increase users, Mincu said.“While it has started in the native digital area it will expand,” Mincu said.“Maiar is the simplest app for people to interact with blockchain technology and can pave the way to building the infrastructure for a new transparent financial system with wide bandwidth and very low latency.”(This story corrects name of Elrond’s currency in para 6)",Reuters

Perhaps they are just unaware of the severity of the problem that tarnishes their reputation as well,” he said in a webinar presentation.Facebook and Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet Inc’s Google, have agreed to appoint representatives in Turkey under a new social media law that critics say will muzzle dissent on digital platforms.Twitter has not complied with the new law, incurring fines and an advertisement ban. Its bandwidth could be narrowed by up to 90% in coming months, essentially making it inaccessible in Turkey.Representatives of Google and Facebook were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday on the IPI report.",Reuters

We can see that all of these accounts and groups are tied together as part of this operation.”The network, mainly active in 2020, used both fake accounts and authentic ones to manage groups and pages, including overt military pages and those that did not disclose their affiliations with the military, Gleicher said.Some of the fake accounts posed as individuals from Thailand’s southern provinces, Gleicher said, adding that the network had spent about $350 on Facebook and Instagram advertisements.Some 700,000 accounts followed one or more of the pages and about 100,000 accounts joined at least one of the groups, he added.Gleicher said Facebook took action on the network based on deceptive behaviour and not the content posted, which included support for the military and the monarchy, and allegations of violence and criticism of insurgent groups in southern Thailand.The move was Facebook’s second takedown of information-influencing operations in Thailand, after one in 2019 involving 12 accounts and 10 pages that used “fictitious personas”.In October, Twitter Inc also took down 926 accounts it said were linked to the Thai army that promoted pro-army and pro-government content. The army denied it was behind the accounts.Twitter in November also suspended a Thai pro-royalist account linked to the palace that a Reuters analysis found was connected to thousands of others that spread content in favour of Thailand’s monarchy.Facebook on Wednesday said it has taken down four other networks from Iran, Russia and Morocco engaged in such coordinated inauthentic behaviour.The company said it has removed more than 100 networks engaged in inauthentic behaviour globally in recent years.",Reuters

MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-cookies/explainer-how-brands-will-target-ads-to-you-after-the-death-of-browser-cookies-idUSKBN2AV1PO,"(Reuters) - Next year, Alphabet Inc’s Google plans to phase out technology in its Chrome browser that lets other companies track users’ web browsing. But that does not mean you will see irrelevant ads, or that the pair of shoes you have been eyeing will stop following you around the web.Here is why Google is making the move, the backlash it has generated and how advertisers plan to personalize ads even after the company kills off a technology known as third-party cookies.Severe data breaches early last decade led to groundbreaking privacy laws, in place since 2018 in the European Union and California, that impose significant fines on violators.The laws ushered an end to the era of big tech companies tracking users’ every move - often without permission - and sharing that data however they wanted with other businesses. Google, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and nearly every other large internet company has become more explicit in allowing users to control what the companies know about them.Cookies are a foundation of the web, allowing you to visit a news publisher without entering log-in credentials each time, for example.But privacy activists say companies that develop online ad technology abuse cookies by tracking users across many websites and letting brands use the data to target ads.Apple’s Safari, Mozilla’s Firefox and upstarts such as Brave have been at the forefront of restricting that practice, and now Chrome, the global market leader with about 60% share, is catching up.For years, online ad technology companies including Google could tell a shoe retailer to personalize an ad to someone reading a Reuters.com article after having tracked that person the week before researching a shoe on Nike.com and checking for a specific color on FootLocker.com.Under these new policies, that tracking across multiple websites is unfeasible.As an alternative, Google is testing a way for businesses to target ads to clusters of consumers who have similar interests, which it says would be more private because it hides individual users in a crowd.The technology, part of a project called the Privacy Sandbox, would use an algorithm to group people according to their common web browsing. Each group would have a minimum membership, so individuals can’t be identified.Brands could target their ads to a cluster interested in buying a car, for example, rather than relying on cookies that have tracked specific users across car-buying websites.Big trade groups representing advertisers have called on Google to delay phasing out cookies until an alternative proves suitable. Google said in January that its tests show the clustering system could be effective.The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority in January began investigating whether restricting cookies on Chrome will help Google increase its dominance in the online ad industry.Critics contend Google is banning rivals from building gigantic profiles on users, while developing for itself features in Chrome to continue to add to such dossiers.Google in a blog post on Wednesday disputed that notion. The company vowed not to develop workarounds for itself, and committed to continue allowing targeting ads based on data that companies receive directly from consumers.Other systems proposed by rivals to Google ad technology include one from Trade Desk Inc that relies on encrypted copies of email addresses that people use to log on to websites. The Washington Post said in December it would adopt The Trade Desk’s tool, called Unified ID 2.0.It is also possible that showing someone ads based on activities they undertook on another website will grow unpopular. Before cookies led to advances in targeting, ads more commonly were related to surrounding content, so a video about vaccines would feature ads from medical fields.",Reuters

C. Arnold McClure chairs the Republican Party in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - deep in Trump country - and wants to punish fellow conservatives who have turned against the former president.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-pennsylvania-insight/in-pennsylvania-republican-rift-over-trump-imperils-partys-election-chances-idUSKBN2AP2J7,"EXTON, Pa. (Reuters) - C. Arnold McClure chairs the Republican Party in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania - deep in Trump country - and wants to punish fellow conservatives who have turned against the former president.McClure is among those pushing the state party to censure Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, Pat Toomey, for voting this month to convict Donald Trump, at his second impeachment trial, of inciting the U.S. Capitol riots. McClure will apply the same standard to any Republican candidate in upcoming elections who seeks support in his rural county: Those who have defended Trump will pass “our first litmus test,” he said. He has a simple question for any who have not: “What the hell?”Other Pennsylvania party leaders say that’s a great way to keep losing elections - after Republicans ceded the White House and control of both houses of Congress to Democrats under Trump’s watch. Shunning Trump’s Republican critics “sends a wrong signal to many of those that are independents or leaning Republican,” said Sam DeMarco, the party chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh.Those dueling views encapsulate the rift among Republicans in Pennsylvania and nationally that some party leaders, along with opinion polls, suggest could imperil its chances in the 2022 congressional elections. Interviews with two dozen Republican officials, activists and political analysts reveal a deep split over strategy in Pennsylvania - a key battleground that could determine whether Republicans retake the Senate next year.Republicans face a potentially self-destructive dynamic in statewide races: Trump loyalists may well prevail over moderate candidates in party primaries, but they are more likely to lose general campaigns against Democrats by turning off centrist voters.“If that primary is going to be a race to the extreme right - and a race to see who is most loyal to Donald Trump - I guarantee you it will be extremely difficult for the Republican Party to win,” said Gene DiGirolamo, a Republican county commissioner in Bucks County - a Philadelphia suburb - and a former state representative.A growing number of Republican voters are unhappy with the party’s direction, according to a Feb. 18-24 Reuters/Ipsos poll. Nearly half – 48% – of self-identified Republicans believe their party “has lost its way,” up 17 percentage points from a similar poll in December. A Reuters review of Pennsylvania state data shows more than 22,000 voters had left the party this year through Feb. 22, compared with fewer than 8,000 Democrats.Still, many party leaders argue that turning against Trumpism isn’t the way forward. Sean Gale, an attorney and fierce Trump backer who has announced a run for Toomey’s seat, said the party has tried and failed to win elections with centrist candidates.“Running a moderate, or a ‘Democrat-light’ Republican, to attract independents and Democrats is a proven recipe for disaster,” he said in an email. “The GOP tried this in 2008 with John McCain and 2012 with Mitt Romney.”Trump lost Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes in November, four years after his upset victory there in 2016. The former president nonetheless remains the de facto leader of the Republican Party. Trump will deliver his first speech since leaving office at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday in Orlando, Fla.Trump spokesman Jason Miller did not respond to a request for comment. A Trump adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump plans to use his political action committee as a “weapon” against more moderate Republicans in next year’s elections.“He’s still going to have an enormous amount of influence on both the direction of the policy and also in evaluating who is a serious standard-bearer for that message,” the adviser said.The Republican Party’s state committee in Pennsylvania met on Wednesday to consider censuring Toomey, but the vote was derailed after a glitch with its electronic balloting system. The party had not yet rescheduled the vote early Thursday.Trump’s brash brand of politics will be on display this Saturday in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, when Lauren Boebert - the gun-toting freshman congresswoman from Colorado - will address gun rights at a party fundraiser.Boebert, a fierce Trump backer, has amplified his false election-fraud claims. She’s also boosted ticket sales for the Pennsylvania fundraiser, said Robert Arena, the county party’s executive director.“The congresswoman is a rising name,” he said.Arena and some other Republican leaders downplayed the party rift, arguing it will be more united for the 2022 campaigns after more than a year under Democratic control in Washington.A pivotal question: Who will they unite behind? Polls suggest Trump’s popularity has faded. About 7 in 10 Republicans approved of Trump in a Jan. 8-12 Reuters/Ipsos poll taken during his last month in office, down from as high as 9 in 10 last year.Still, no other Republican comes close to being perceived as the party’s standard-bearer. Reuters/Ipsos polling between Feb. 18 and 24 asked Republican voters to pick from a list of prominent Republicans, not including Trump, who they thought embodied the qualities of an American leader. Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a chief Trump backer, polled highest, at 22%. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - who has recently blasted Trump over his role in the Capitol riots - was favored by just 3%, the same as firebrand congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been widely criticized for promoting conspiracy theories.REPUBLICAN CIVIL WAR ‘CANCELED’Asked about the attempt to censure Toomey, the party’s national Senate campaign organization pointed to comments this week from Senator Rick Scott, its chairman, declaring that the “Republican civil war has been cancelled.”“Those fanning these flames, in both the media and our own ranks, desire a GOP civil war,” he wrote in a memo. “No, we don’t have time for that.”The infighting won’t be so easy to wish away, said John Kennedy, a political science professor at West Chester University in Chester County. The increasingly Trumpian base of Republican voters, he said, will make it difficult for any moderate to win Pennsylvania’s party primaries, in which only Republicans vote.Some analysts and moderate Republicans noted that the party tried nominating Trump-like candidates for Senate and governor in 2018, and they lost by double digits. Others compared the current insurgency to the Tea Party movement that divided Republicans a decade ago, when Tea Party-backed candidates were blamed for party losses in Senate elections.Howard Merrick, the chairman of the Republican committee in Schuylkill County, a Trump stronghold, said that voters leaving the party are not necessarily just anti-Trump moderates. They also include Trump supporters who are furious with his Republican critics - and who still believe Trump’s claims that he lost a rigged election.“There are people who are very, very mad at everything that happened,” he said. “Most are mad at Congress - those senators like Toomey who have not stood up for Trump.”Yet Merrick believes the effort to censure Toomey would only further undermine the party. “It hurts us to do this,” he said.Toomey’s Senate seat in Pennsylvania is up for grabs because he has announced he will not run for re-election in 2022.The Senate is currently divided 50-50, with Democrats in power because Vice President Kamala Harris has the tie-breaking vote. Losing in Pennsylvania - widely seen as the most competitive 2022 Senate race - would make it much harder for Republicans to retake the chamber.The changing perception of Toomey, who declined an interview request, illustrates the party’s shift toward Trumpism. Once considered a reliable conservative, he’s now reviled as a traitor among some Trump backers.

Several Republicans from states that produce fossil fuels, including Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven, both of North Dakota, and Steve Daines, of Montana, joined Democrats in supporting her.Granholm wants to boost jobs in manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs) and wind and solar power, and is likely to play a big role in Biden’s goal to put the country on a path of decarbonizing the economy by 2050.She said during Senate hearings that critical minerals, used in batteries for EVs and to support the electric grid, in wind turbines and solar panels, can be mined responsibly in the United States.Some Republicans who voted against her, including Senator John Barrasso of top coal producing state Wyoming, said Biden’s green push would harm high paying jobs in fossil fuels.Biden “has declared war on American energy and American energy workers and I just can’t stand by as this administration tries to crush Wyoming’s economy,” Barrasso said shortly before the vote.Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal- and natural gas-producing West Virginia, said Granholm, when governor, helped save the auto industry during the Great Recession.“She brought in new investment in new industry and she created new jobs, leaving no worker behind,” said Manchin, the chairman of the Senate energy committee.The energy secretary oversees the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and the emergency petroleum reserve, and is a member of the president’s cabinet.Once sworn in, Granholm, 62, will be the second female U.S. energy secretary after Hazel O’Leary served in the Clinton administration in the 1990s.",Reuters

European telecoms firms are cashing in on the money-making power of masts, as tower companies line up to pay multi-billion dollar price tags for antennas buzzing with ever more data ahead of the advent of 5G.
MAR 03 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-towers/european-telcos-cash-in-on-tower-assets-as-high-cost-5g-investment-looms-idUSKBN2AV1DN,"MADRID/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - European telecoms firms are cashing in on the money-making power of masts, as tower companies line up to pay multi-billion dollar price tags for antennas buzzing with ever more data ahead of the advent of 5G.Faced with straitened revenue growth and stubbornly high debt built up during the last network upgrade, telecoms companies are relishing the quick cash injections they can get from selling these portfolios, or future income from spin-offs.Upgrading networks, including towers, for 5G - which promises an age of self-driving cars and brain surgery performed at a distance - will soak up some $890 billion between 2020 and 2025, the GSMA industry body says.European operators are increasingly willing to exploit assets to help finance those build-outs. While selling towers outright brings piles of cash, many are also looking to create separate tower units or launch joint ventures with independent companies as a way to keep a chunk of potential future growth.So far this year, Vodafone has lined up its towers business for the European sector’s biggest listing since 2014, while Orange created a separate towers unit.Independent tower companies have proved hungry to buy, snapping up more than 14 billion euros ($16.9 billion) worth of assets so far this year to access the steady, inflation-linked returns antenna-topped towers generate.But around 66% of sites in Europe are still wholly or partially owned by phone companies, Barclays estimates, compared with less than 10% in the United States. “The market is unlocking,” said Julian Plumstead, Chief Executive for Europe at American Tower, which bought more than 30,000 towers from Spain’s Telefonica in January.Compared to the United States, Plumstead told Reuters, “We are still in the early to middle ages of our industrial development, but looking forward I think the trend will continue and possibly accelerate.”In cases where operators and tower companies have signed joint ventures, the tower companies say they usually have the option to buy out the operators after a number of years.This means some are gradually relinquishing these unlikely trophies in stages. Telefonica netted more than $9 billion with the sale to American Tower of sites it had already hived off into a separate unit in 2016.“We fully understand the interest of the operators in going for this two-stage approach,” Cellnex Deputy Chief Executive Alex Mestre told Reuters. “There is revalorization of the asset ... and the operators can seize that.”Plumstead said American Tower had managed to beef up its portfolio - from an admittedly low base - in Europe this year despite restrictions on movement.“Getting people into the field has not been as easy... but we’ve built more towers this year than in Europe last year and we’ll plan to do the same again this year.” Towers are prized assets partly because contracts to use them are like an “infinite marriage” in which operators pay steady rates for decades, in the words of one industry expert.Shares of both American Tower and Cellnex touched record highs last year during the pandemic after more than doubling and more than tripling respectively in value in the last half decade.Deal-making has been concentrated in Western Europe until now, but regional leader Cellnex and American Tower, whose buy from Telefonica increased its presence in Europe sevenfold, are both now looking further east and in Scandinavia.“We are looking at a wider geographic scope,” Cellnex’s Mestre said. “We have started also in the Nordics, we have started in Poland and in all those areas in our core geographies where we believe there are still a lot of towers yet to be outsourced.”Almost all European operators are now discussing what they should do with their tower assets, industry executives say.High multiples paid for recent deals have piqued their interest. American Tower paid Telefonica around 30x its tower unit’s most recent core earnings for the assets, according to analysts at Moody’s.Operators willing to part with their towers have commanded average valuations 22.1 times higher than the assets’ core earnings since mid-2018, Moody’s also said. Cellnex clinched the lowest price among recent deals, paying 16x earnings for a portfolio from Poland’s Play last October.“If you conclude that it’s not really a competitive advantage to own the towers, then you should dispose of them because the multiple arbitrage is high,” said Nikos Stathopoulos, chairman of mobile operator United Group, which owns 6,000 towers in Bulgaria, Slovenia and Croatia.Sweden’s Telia is also considering wringing money out of its more than 9,000 towers by partnering with external investors, a spokeswoman told Reuters, while Telenor is also aiming to generate value from its tower portfolio, a representative said.($1 = 0.8314 euros)",Reuters

Allegro has set the bar very high,” said Modrakowska, whose weekly shop spans everything from organic food to batteries. She is one of Allegro’s 20 million monthly customers in Poland, a nation of 38 million.“It has the parcel lockers option and I don’t know how Amazon will handle this. Waiting for a courier or going to the post office is not an option.”Amazon launched its Polish website on Tuesday, entering a fast-growing e-commerce market with a proven playbook and global reach that have already secured success against entrenched local competitors in other markets, such as Argos in Britain.“Business is not winner take all - industries rise together,” an Amazon spokesman said when asked about local competitors.“There’s a ton of green field ahead – and there will continue to be lots of winners,” he said, adding the company focused on customers rather than competitors.The U.S. company currently has a tiny presence in emerging Europe’s e-commerce market, which Euromonitor estimates at 16 billion euros ($19 billion) in Poland and 6 billion euros in the Czech Republic. Until now, it has run logistics centres in the region and served customers from its German website.The region is dwarfed by Europe’s top e-commerce markets of Britain and Germany, worth 1 trillion euros and nearly 700 billion euros respectively, according to Euromonitor.But Poland’s 42% growth rate leads Europe, and makes it an attractive target.Allegro told Reuters it had improved terms for shoppers and third-party sellers alike during the COVID-19 pandemic, as more consumers shifted online.“We reduced fees and provided extended payment terms,” Chief Executive Francois Nuyts said. “We are convinced that by serving sellers and consumers extremely well during the pandemic, they will stick with us.”(Graphic: Most popular e-commerce platforms in the world: )Allegro, founded in a Poznan garage 20 years ago, debuted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in October with one of Europe’s biggest initial public offerings of the year, and immediately became Poland’s largest listed firm.It now ranks as the 13th most popular e-commerce platform in the world with 220 million monthly visits, behind global leader Amazon, which generates 4.5 billion monthly visits, and China’s AliExpress at 467 million monthly visits, according to Statista.But in Poland, Allegro has a 33% share of the e-commerce market, with Alibaba Group’s AliExpress at 3.6% and Amazon at 1.3%, according to Euromonitor.While Allegro declined to speak specifically about Amazon, its chief executive outlined plans to increase investments in areas such as research and development. It also plans to hire 1,200 workers for a new logistics centre near Warsaw.“We see across the region this massive acceleration. It started a little bit later, but it is catching up much faster than I have seen anywhere else, at least in Europe,” Nuyts said.“That’s why we have such a hiring streak ahead of us,” he added, referring to Allegro’s projects mostly in innovation and R&D.E-commerce experts say local market knowledge can confer a competitive edge, especially should Amazon repeat the missteps it made last October in Sweden where translation errors and glitches, including mistaking the Argentinean flag for the Scandinavian country’s, marred the company’s debut.“Allegro has developed a strong local brand,” PwC’s central and eastern Europe consumer goods and retail chief, Krzysztof Badowski, told Reuters. “They have mainly competed with themselves but still introduced concepts like same-day delivery to strengthen their position.“Challenging Allegro will require a significant investment from Amazon, but Allegro is in position to defend its share for some period of time.”Online retailer Alza, the largest Czech player whose turnover hit 37.3 billion crowns ($1.7 billion) in 2020, has also been gearing up for new market entrants.For example, the privately-held company, which is targeting 20% growth a year, is starting to develop its own marketplace.It also plans to boost the number of parcel pick-up boxes in its core markets of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary to around 3,000 in 2022 from 800 currently, vice chairman Tomas Havryluk told Reuters.Alza, which also operates in Austria, Germany and Britain, may look to double the number of countries it is in over the next five years, although it hasn’t decided which ones.“We are trying to catch up as much as we can while we have time,” Havryluk said on Amazon, while adding the U.S. giant did not dominate the firm’s plans.“The only thing you can do (in the home market) is have more customers and better relations with them than any new competitors coming to the Czech Republic.”",Reuters

Let’s get the vaccine instead, right?” Harris said in excerpts from an MSNBC interview.“We know Black people are disproportionately likely to contract the virus and die from it,” Harris said. “We know when you look at who the frontline workers are, who is the most at risk disproportionately. We are talking about people of color.”Blacks and Hispanics have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19 with a disproportionate number of deaths, and public health officials have broadly called for equity in vaccine distribution.Harris, the first Black and Asian U.S. vice president, noted that Black small businesses were also being affected, with 40% going out of business.“It is disproportionately affecting us and if we want to get control of this virus that is harming us at a disproportionate rate, part of it is to get vaccinated,” she said in the interview, to be broadcast in full on Saturday.Early data on U.S. coronavirus vaccinations suggested that Blacks and Hispanics received a smaller proportion of shots than their representation among healthcare workers and nursing home residents, two priority groups for COVID-19 inoculations.Enrollment of Black Americans in clinical trials was also a particular challenge. Mistrust runs high, in part because of the nation’s history of unethical practices in medical research on African Americans.Harris’ comments came as President Joe Biden’s administration announced the distribution of 25 million masks to vulnerable populations in community health centers and at food pantries and soup kitchens.Two-thirds of the people served by community health centers live in poverty, 60% are racial and/or ethnic minorities and nearly 1.4 million are homeless, the White House said.In outreach to Black Americans in New York on Wednesday, the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, appeared at the York College mass vaccination site with Black clergy members.Bishop Calvin Rice of the New Jerusalem Worship Center in the New York City borough of Queens said he had been vaccinated without incident.“This site is being opened specifically for our community - Every tube that’s available for vaccination, you need to come and get it,” Rice said.“We’ve seen what our communities look like fighting COVID without the vaccine and it’s painful,” he added. “I believe the vaccine is safe.

He had previously said that he was undecided on her bid.“While we do not agree on every issue, (Haaland) reaffirmed her strong commitment to bipartisanship, addressing the diverse needs of our country and maintaining our nation’s energy independence,” Manchin said in a statement. “For all these reasons, I believe Deb Haaland will be a Secretary of the Interior for every American and will vote to confirm her.”Haaland’s Senate confirmation hearing this week was contentious, with Republicans focusing on her past opposition to fossil fuel projects, as well as her likely role as a key player in President Joe Biden’s efforts to combat climate change.The U.S. Interior Department oversees around a fifth of the nation’s land surface along with offshore waters, accounting for around 25% of domestic oil and gas production.

987,U.S. State Department creates position of diversity officer,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-diplomacy-diversity/u-s-state-department-creates-position-of-diversity-officer-idUSKBN2AO2HG,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday announced the creation of a State Department chief diversity officer, an effort to make the diplomatic corps more representative and part of President Joe Biden’s pledge to work to heal U.S. racial divisions.The diversity and inclusion officer will report directly to Blinken, according to a statement that did not say who would be named to the position.Diversity, equity and racial justice rose to the top of the national agenda last year. The police killing of Black man George Floyd in May after years of such deaths sparked nationwide and global protests that highlighted systemic bias in many American institutions.“The State Department has the honor of representing the American people to the world. To do that well, we must recruit and retain a workforce that truly reflects America,” Blinken said.The move reflects a sea change from the administration of former President Donald Trump, who directed federal agencies last year to end programs deemed divisive by the White House. The State Department suspended all training programs for employees related to diversity and inclusion.During Biden’s first days in office, the State Department resumed that training, and he promised more action to heal the country’s racial divide.Deputy assistant secretaries from State Department bureaus will serve on a new leadership council, and the department will soon release a diversity and inclusion strategic plan, Blinken said.The new diversity officer will advance policies in this area and “hold senior leadership accountable on progress. Our goal is to incorporate diversity and inclusion into the Department’s work at every level,” Blinken said in a statement.With 76,000 employees globally, racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented at the department, particularly in senior ranks, according to an independent federal watchdog report released last year.",Reuters

Addressing drivers’ concerns about where they can be charged is seen as vital to encouraging wider usage.“The expansion of public charging points continues unabated,” BDEW said, adding that government efforts to boost demand for electric vehicles and equipment were bearing fruit.BDEW data showed one in seven of the 3,788 charging points added since December were fast-chargers, which now make up about 10% of the total around the country.The expanding number of charge points would ease public concerns about using electric vehicles, even though 90% of charging was conducted at home or the workplace, BDEW said.It said a national target of 1 million charging points by 2030 might not be achieved but that number might not be necessary if enough fast charging points were included in the rollout.Germany launched a 3 billion euro ($3.6 billion) scheme in November to extend consumer rebates for buying electric vehicles and wallbox chargers, and supporting programmes for scrapping old vehicles and investing in innovation.BDEW said the number of applications for subsidies to install private wallboxes had risen to 300,000.($1 = 0.8275 euros)",Reuters

In other cases, hackers took advantage of the way customers had set up their Microsoft services to compromise their targets or dive further into affected networks.Hackers who went after SolarWinds also breached Microsoft itself, accessing and downloading source code - including elements of Exchange, the company’s email and calendaring product.McLellan said that for now, the hacking activity he had seen appeared focused on seeding malicious software and setting the stage for a potentially deeper intrusion rather than aggressively moving into networks right away.“We haven’t seen any follow-on activity yet,” he said. “We’re going to find a lot of companies affected but a smaller number of companies actually exploited.”Microsoft said targets included infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and non-governmental groups.",Reuters

And a key element of going forward will be the funding of the Chips Act,” Caulfield said.U.S. President Joe Biden, who took office in January, has pledged to support the effort, and senators are looking at providing emergency funding for the law as part of a bigger package to counter China’s rise, as chipmaking has shifted to Asia.GlobalFoundries is the world’s third-largest foundry by revenue behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd but ranks second when factoring out the part of Samsung’s foundry business that makes chips for other elements of the South Korean firm.",Reuters

That would represent growth of 98% to 107% compared with the same period a year earlier.San Mateo, California-based Roblox is among the world’s most-popular gaming sites and offers a host of titles across mobile devices and games consoles.The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in demand for video games as people staying at home look for entertainment.However, on its investor day last week, Chief Financial Officer Mike Guthrie said the company had “pretty low expectations” on revenue in China over the next few years, as it plans to invest heavily to attract users.Roblox also said it expects daily active users of 37.6 million to 39.6 million in the first quarter, up 59% to 68% from a year earlier.The gaming platform is going public through a direct listing, eschewing a traditional initial public offering. In a direct listing, no shares are sold in advance. The company’s share price in its market debut is determined by orders coming into the stock exchange.

992,"Analysis: Biden's SEC chair nominee signals more regulation for cryptocurrencies
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appears likely to work on its first guidelines for cryptocurrencies after President Joe Biden's nominee to lead the agency promised to provide ""guidance and clarity"" to the rapidly evolving market.

The SEC has not adopted rules specifically tailored to cryptocurrencies and how they should be treated by people and companies, which some argue has created an unclear rulebook.“It’s important for the SEC to provide guidance and clarity,” Gensler said. “Sometimes that’s a clarity that will be a thumbs up, but even if it’s thumbs down, it’s important to provide that.”As a decentralized asset created by users, Bitcoin is likely exempt from securities laws. But there is a “strong case” that digital currencies created and issued by companies have likely violated securities law, Gensler said at a conference in 2018. These include the second and third most widely used virtual currencies, which were created by Ripple Labs and Ethereum.The SEC has said Bitcoin is not a security and is suing Ripple alleging it broke laws with an unregistered digital-asset securities offering. The agency has previously said Ethereum’s Ether is not a security, a view that diverges from Gensler’s.Bitcoin hit record highs last month after companies including car-maker Tesla and Mastercard said they were embracing the cryptocurrency.Globally, the highly volatile cryptocurrency market was worth roughly $1.45 trillion as of Tuesday afternoon, up from around $200 billion two years ago, according to data from CoinMarketCap.The crypto industry as well as some SEC officials have for years been calling for clarity over how cryptocurrencies fit into securities laws. Previous SEC chief Jay Clayton took the view that most coin offerings, a cryptocurrency fundraising mechanism, appeared to run afoul of securities laws.Leading the CFTC in the aftermath of the 2009 financial crisis, Gensler implemented complex new derivatives rules, often butting heads with Wall Street groups. He later taught a class on cryptocurrencies at MIT.“Gensler would bring to the job a high degree of knowledge about crypto, and I think that’s helpful for someone trying to regulate in this space,” Hester Peirce, a Republican SEC commissioner who has supported clearer rules for digital assets, told Reuters last month.The growing embrace of digital assets by companies and investors adds to the urgency, Peirce added.“Industry has been pretty clear they would like more regulatory certainty they were not able to get that under Chair Clayton. I think Mr. Gensler understands that,” said Matthew Kulkin, co-chair of Steptoe & Johnson LLP’s Financial Services Group.",Reuters

Shares of Rocket, the parent company of Quicken Loans, closed up 71.2% at $41.60 after being halted several times for volatility. More than 367 million shares changed hands in the stock’s busiest trading day ever.The outsized move puts Rocket among the stocks that have experienced wild gyrations after becoming a focus of investors on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets, where mentions of the company have multiplied in recent days. The company’s market cap rose by more than $34 billion to $82.6 billion.Shares of Rocket Companies are also heavily shorted, leaving them vulnerable to a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, where investors betting against a company’s shares are forced to unwind their positions after a rally in the stock price.A short squeeze, sparked in part by retail investors coordinating on WallStreetBets, helped fuel a more than 1,600% run in GameStop’s shares in January, before they pared much of those gains the following month.“This feels very much like a retail-driven move and also probably a short squeeze,” said Barclays analyst Mark DeVries.The value of Rocket shares shorted stood at $1.2 billion as of Monday’s close, accounting for nearly 46% of the float, compared with 35.5% at the beginning of February, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners.The position makes Rocket the fifth largest short in the banking sector, behind JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup, S3 data showed.The firm issued a report titled “Rocket Shorts are Crashing and Burning” and Dusaniwsky referred to the trading activity as “GameStop-esque.”Jefferies analyst Ryan Carr on Feb. 25 raised his price target on the stock to $30, from $27.50, after the company reported fourth-quarter results that handily beat Wall Street expectations.While Rocket has been growing quickly, some experts have warned that the U.S. housing market could experience a slowdown later in 2021, even as low interest rates fuel refinancings.As a result, some investors have snubbed the initial public offerings of mortgage lenders. Rocket had to slash the size of its offering by about a third due to lackluster demand when it debuted in August.Rocket’s Chief Executive Officer Jay Farner is due to participate in Morgan Stanley’s Technology, Media & Telecom conference on Wednesday morning.Mentions of Rocket on WallstreetBets have shot higher in recent days, according to website SwaggyStocks.com, which tracks comments on the forum.Meanwhile shares in another mortgage company, UWM Holdings, closed up 19.7% at $9.13 with trading volume exceeding five times the 10-day moving average.Other stocks followed closely by retail investors were lower Tuesday, with shares of GameStop closing down 1.8% while headphone maker Koss Corp tumbled 14.6% and AMC Entertainment fell 2.7%.",Reuters

Thomas-Greenfield and her supporters pushed back, citing her decades as a diplomat seeking to increase U.S. influence and counteract China’s.At her confirmation hearing in late January, she stressed the importance of U.S. re-engagement with the 193-member United Nations in order to challenge efforts by China to “drive an authoritarian agenda.”China has been working to gain greater global influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership, often by providing loans to developing nations in Africa and elsewhere that tie them closer to the Beijing government.“Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield has a long history of expressed opposition to China’s use of debt trap tactics and its increasingly malign presence in world governance bodies,” Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said as he urged support.Tension between the two superpowers hit a boiling point at the United Nations last year over the coronavirus pandemic, as then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, pulled the United States back from international organizations as part of his “America First” foreign policy agenda.Biden, a Democrat, has stressed his support for multilateralism in foreign policy, not just by picking a veteran diplomat for the U.N. post, but restoring it to a Cabinet role.",Reuters

These include a pause on new oil and gas leasing on federal acreage, currently the source of around a quarter of U.S. production.Republicans have been battling Biden’s sweeping plan to combat global warming and expand renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. But most Democrats on the panel applauded Biden’s focus on climate, a U-turn from former President Donald Trump’s policy. Trump emphasized oil, gas and coal production on federal lands over the fight against climate change.Republicans on the Senate energy committee pressed Haaland on Biden’s pause on new federal drilling leases. They also challenged her past statements against oil and gas production and her presence at the protest against the Dakota Access pipeline led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy asked Haaland if she had a prejudice against fossil fuels.“Prejudice on fossil fuels perhaps isn’t the way I would describe it,” Haaland said. “I would say that President Biden is ... moving toward the tremendous opportunities we have in diversifying our energy.”Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo tribal citizen, said her own economic struggles as a single mother who relied on food stamps made her well attuned to the job and economic security concerns raised by senators from energy producing states. Republicans and some Democrats from those states are concerned that drilling restrictions or other measures to curtail fossil fuels development would cost them jobs and revenues.She assured her critics that she recognizes that “fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in America” and that revenues fund critical services in states.New Mexico Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich, who introduced Haaland, said she has a track record of working across the aisle.He called her “a true partner for states like ours as we diversify our economy, invest in our communities and remain a global leader in producing and exporting energy.”She noted that the administration’s temporary pause on new leasing does not apply to drilling and other operations by existing lease holders.Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski called Haaland’s nomination “very significant” but raised concerns about the impact of Biden’s executive orders on her state’s resource-based economy. She said Interior has an “outsized” influence over Alaska, 60% of which is owned by the federal government.Alaska Republican Congressman Don Young, who joined Heinrich in introducing Haaland, said despite their disagreements over “carbon fuels” she is able to listen and work across the aisle.

Robinhood, the online brokerage used by many retail traders to pile in to heavily shorted stocks like GameStop Corp, has made an ambitious push into loaning out its clients' shares to short sellers as it expands its business.
MAR 02 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-robinhood-securitiesle/robinhood-a-go-to-for-young-traders-benefits-from-short-sale-demand-idUSKCN2AU2EP,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Robinhood, the online brokerage used by many retail traders to pile in to heavily shorted stocks like GameStop Corp, has made an ambitious push into loaning out its clients’ shares to short sellers as it expands its business.The broker had $1.9 billion in shares loaned out as of Dec. 31, nearly three times the $674 million a year earlier, and it was permitted to lend out $4.6 billion worth of securities under margin agreements, around five times bigger than the prior year, according to an annual regulatory filing late on Monday.The size of the jump highlights Robinhood’s rapid growth over the past year as the number of retail investors has soared in the work-from-home environment during the pandemic and as retail brokers have largely eliminated trading fees, a model Robinhood helped pioneer.Menlo Park, California-based Robinhood is expected to go public this year with a valuation of more than $20 billion.Securities lending is common among brokerages, which can earn income by lending shares to hedge funds and others, who then sell the shares back into the market, betting the share prices will drop so they can buy them back at a lower price when it is time to return them, pocketing the difference.Shares that are in heavy demand from short sellers, like GameStop, which had 140% short interest in January, command the biggest premium from the lender.What makes Robinhood notable is that many of the stocks its users invest in are among the most sought-after by people who want to bet against them, said one senior financial executive involved with hedge funds.It was unclear how great a benefit the securities lending was to Robinhood’s revenue and income, which it does not disclose.Robinhood declined to comment.The brokerage does not allow short selling on its platform.In January, retail investors coordinated through trading forums on social media in an attempt to punish hedge funds by buying up shares of GameStop and other heavily shorted names, like AMC Entertainment, driving up their prices and forcing short sellers to close out positions at big losses.On Jan. 28, at the height of the retail trading mania, Robinhood, along with several other brokers, restricted the buying of GameStop and other so-called meme stocks due to a massive spike in collateral requirements needed to clear the trades, angering many of its customers.On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission promised a thorough review of issues raised by the GameStop saga, as well as other issues related to retail brokers and investors.The trading restrictions had already sparked congressional hearings, regulatory probes and placed greater scrutiny on short selling.In response, Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s chief executive officer, called for shorter stock settlement times, which would reduce clearing collateral requirements.He also said the idea that more shares of a stock can be shorted than there are available to trade, as was the case with GameStop, is a “pathology” that could destabilize the financial markets.Robinhood positioned itself for growth in securities lending in October 2018 by launching its own clearing broker, which acts as a go-between with the clearinghouse that settles its trades, and allows it to hold its customers’ assets. The broker can then lend out securities its customers buy on margin.At present, less than 3% of Robinhood’s funded accounts are margin-enabled, Tenev recently told Congress.",Reuters

India is ready to offer incentives to ensure Tesla Inc's cost of production would be less than in China if the carmaker commits to making its electric vehicles in the south Asian country, transport minister Nitin Gadkari told Reuters.
MAR 02 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-tesla-minister-exclusive/exclusive-india-woos-tesla-with-offer-of-cheaper-production-costs-than-china-idUSKBN2AU1AY,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is ready to offer incentives to ensure Tesla Inc’s cost of production would be less than in China if the carmaker commits to making its electric vehicles in the south Asian country, transport minister Nitin Gadkari told Reuters.Gadkari’s pitch comes weeks after billionaire Elon Musk’s Tesla registered a company in India in a step towards entering the country, possibly as soon as mid-2021. Sources familiar with the matter have said Tesla plans to start by importing and selling its Model 3 electric sedan in India.“Rather than assembling (the cars) in India they should make the entire product in the country by hiring local vendors. Then we can give higher concessions,” Gadkari said in an interview, without giving details of what incentives would be on offer.“The government will make sure the production cost for Tesla will be the lowest when compared with the world, even China, when they start manufacturing their cars in India. We will assure that,” he said.India wants to boost local manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs), batteries and other components to cut costly imports and curb pollution in its major cities.This comes amid a global race by carmakers to jump-start EV production as countries work towards cutting carbon emissions.But India faces a big challenge to win a production commitment from Tesla, which did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment about its plans in the country.India’s fledgling EV market accounted for just 5,000 out of a total 2.4 million cars sold in the country last year as negligible charging infrastructure and the high cost of EVs deterred buyers.In contrast, China, where Tesla already makes cars, sold 1.25 million new energy passenger vehicles, including EVs, in 2020 out of total sales of 20 million, and accounted for more than a third of Tesla’s global sales.India also doesn’t have a comprehensive EV policy like China, the world’s biggest auto market, which mandates companies to invest in the sector.Gadkari said that as well as being a big market, India could be an export hub, especially with about 80% of components for lithium-ion batteries being made locally now.“I think it’s a win-win situation for Tesla,” Gadkari said, adding he also wanted to engage with Tesla about building an ultra high-speed hyperloop between Delhi and Mumbai.India is drawing up a production-linked incentive scheme for auto and auto component makers as well as for setting up advanced battery manufacturing units, but the details are yet to be finalised.Switching to cleaner sources of energy and reducing vehicle pollution are seen as essential for India to meet its Paris Accord climate commitments.India last year introduced tougher emission rules for carmakers to bring them up to international standards. It is now looking at tightening fuel efficiency rules from April 2022, which industry executives say may compel some automakers to add electric or hybrid vehicles to their portfolios.Battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry says it needs longer to make the transition.Gadkari said he was not directly responsible for making the decision on whether to delay, but was confident India would meet its Paris treaty commitments without disrupting economic growth.“Development and environment will go hand in hand. We will take some time but we will soon reach the international standard norms,” he said.",Reuters

This means the C40’s range will be extended over time with software upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Henrik Green said.Carmakers are racing to switch to zero-emission models as they face CO2 emissions targets in Europe and China, plus looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles.Last month, Ford Motor Co said its lineup in Europe will be fully electric by 2030, while Tata Motors unit Jaguar Land Rover said its luxury Jaguar brand will be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch electric models of its entire line-up by 2030.In November, luxury carmaker Bentley, owned by Germany’s Volkswagen, said its models would be all electric by 2030.Electrification is expensive for carmakers and as electric vehicles have fewer moving parts, employment in the car industry is expected to shrink.Volvo CEO Samuelsson said that industry-wide, electrification will mostly affect engine plants and auto suppliers providing everything from oil filters to fuel injectors and spark plugs.“Those are a lot of jobs of course,” he said. “But overall I don’t think there will be a big difference.”Volvo said it will “radically reduce” the complexity of its model line-up and provide customers with transparent pricing.The carmaker’s global network of 2,400 traditional bricks-and-mortar dealers will remain open to service vehicles and to help customers make online orders.So far Volvo has not been affected by a pandemic-fueled global semiconductor chip shortage that has temporarily shut a number of assembly plants, which Samuelsson said was thanks to constant communication with suppliers.“So far, knock on wood, we have not had to stop any assembly line,” he said. “But it could happen any day.”",Reuters

I do not plan to be interfered with by anyone. I expect the Justice Department will make its own decisions in this regard.”Garland’s promises marked a contrast from previous Attorney General William Barr, who was criticized for his willingness to intervene in criminal cases in ways that benefited Trump’s political allies, from Michael Flynn to Roger Stone.Garland pledged to sit down with department staff, who have suffered from low morale for the past four years amid partisan attacks and accusations by Trump they were part of a “deep state.”“I want to make clear to the career prosecutors...that my job is to protect them from partisan or other improper motives,” Garland said, adding that for now his visits with them will need to be over Zoom due to the pandemic.Garland, a federal appellate judge and former prosecutor, is widely expected to be confirmed as the nation’s top U.S. law enforcement official.He was nominated to lead a Justice Department in the midst of intensive investigations into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters - an incident Garland called “heinous.”Some of the more than 200 people arrested in the siege were associated with groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, underscoring rising concern about future violence from right-wing extremists.Garland has experience in tackling such threats, having managed the sprawling investigation into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by anti-government extremists and supervising the prosecution of the so-called Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski after a deadly bombing spree.Garland told the committee he fears the Jan.6 riots were “not necessarily a one-off” and vowed to devote resources to the probe.“We must do everything in the power of the Justice Department to prevent this kind of interference with policies of American democratic institutions,” Garland said.Garland’s pledge to maintain the independence of Justice Department investigations will also encompass ongoing cases that may cast members of Biden’s family or former Obama officials in an unfavorable light.Amid questioning by Republicans, Garland said he had not discussed the Justice Department’s investigation into Hunter Biden’s taxes with the White House.Biden has made clear that decisions about investigations and prosecutions will be left to the Justice Department, Garland told lawmakers. “So the answer to your question is no.”He told Republicans he expects to allow John Durham, who was appointed by Barr to investigate the origins of the investigation into Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, to continue his work.“I understand that he has been permitted to remain in his position and sitting here today I have no reason to think that that was not the correct decision,” Garland said.Apart from the Justice Department’s focus on combating domestic terrorism, Garland said he intends to prioritize enforcing the civil rights laws, an area advocates say was decimated during the Trump administration.The Justice Department has faced pressure to take steps to hold police departments accountable for civil rights violations, after a white police officer killed African American George Floyd last year in Minneapolis.The killing sparked nationwide protests, but those did little to motivate the Justice Department to open probes into systemic police misconduct or other civil rights violations.Unlike Barr, who told Congress last year he did not believe systemic racism plagued the criminal justice system, Garland was unequivocal on whether the system treats Americans equally.“Sadly, and it’s plain to me, that it’s not, that it does not,” Garland told Democratic Senator Cory Booker.Garland said he would resume using court-ordered consent decrees to hold police departments accountable, a tool largely abandoned during the Trump administration.He also told Congress his support for the death penalty has eroded amid concerns it disproportionately affects Black Americans and other communities of color and that too many are wrongfully convicted.Garland stopped short of saying he will advocate for commuting all federal death sentences, but he did embrace Biden’s support for eliminating mandatory minimum sentences as part of criminal justice reform.",Reuters

Here are some quotes from the hearingGarland told Congress he used to support the death penalty, including the execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, a case he prosecuted. He said his views have evolved due to concerns about executing innocent people and its disparate impact on communities of color.“I have had a great pause about the death penalty. I am very concerned about the large number of exonerations that have occurred through DNA evidence and otherwise,” he said.“The data is clear that it has an enormously disparate impact on Black Americans and members of communities of color.”Garland revealed he will not seek to prioritize marijuana possession prosecutions.“We can focus our attention on violent crimes and other crimes that put great danger in our society, and not allocate our resources to some things like marijuana possession.”“We should do as, as President Biden has suggested, seek the elimination of mandatory minimum. So that we once again give authority to district judges and trial judges to make determinations based on all of the sentencing factors that judges normally apply.”“We don’t have to seek highest possible offense with the highest possible sentence. ... Legislatively, we should look at equalizing ... what’s known as the crack powder ratio, which has had an enormously disproportionate impact on communities of color.”‘DEFUNDING THE POLICE’“President Biden has said he does not support defunding the police, and neither do I.”“I do really and President Biden believes in giving resources to police departments to help them reform and gain the trust of their communities.”“I think police accountability is an essential element of the ability of a police department to have credibility with the community.”“Congress has given the Justice Department the authority and the responsibility to investigate patterns or practices of law enforcement and...conduct that violate the Constitution and laws of the United States... It is an important tool the department has for ensuring accountability.”Garland said he supports the use consent decrees as needed to hold police departments accountable.“Where they are necessary to ensure accountability, it’s very important that we use that tool.”ON CRACKING DOWN ON THE PROLIFERATION OF CHEMICAL LOOK-ALIKES OF FENTANYL:“To be honest, I’m not no chemist (sic). This is one of the reasons I ended up being a lawyer, instead of a doctor. But I would need to look at what would be proposed.

Some have until the end of 2020 and others until the middle of 2021 to meet capital adequacy requirements, he said.“But by a maximum of two years, (the capital adequacy of) all platforms should be back on track,” Guo added.With regards to Ant Group’s restructuring, Guo said there were no restrictions on the financial business it develops but that all of its financial activities should to be regulated by laws.Ant Group is in talks with other shareholders in its new consumer finance unit to bolster the firm’s capital as the fintech giant prepares to fold in its lucrative micro-lending businesses, Reuters reported last week.It would need an additional capital of 30 billion yuan ($4.64 billion) to meet regulatory requirements, according to the report.($1 = 6.4714 Chinese yuan)",Reuters

That’s why we’re opening a New York office and investing $50 million into the country’s sports industry in order to launch Fan Tokens with leading franchises from the five major U.S. sports leagues,” Dreyfus said.“We head to the U.S. with a proven track record in generating millions of dollars of revenue for some of Europe’s biggest sporting organisations. In 2020, we shared more than $30 million with our partners, but this year we’re targeting a minimum of $60 million.”Dreyfus said the FanMarketCap, a fan token price and market information tracker run by Chiliz, currently stands at just under $200 million and that he expects it to grow with the addition of new European soccer clubs in the coming weeks.Chiliz are also in talks with Formula One and e-sports teams, he added.Joseph Edwards, head of research at cryptocurrency brokerage Enigma Securities, said the timing is perfect for clubs, who need to boost revenue after the hits from COVID-19 related restrictions, given the current popularity of crypto markets.“Fan tokens right now are just hitting the perfect itch at the perfect time - fans are disconnected physically from their fandom, and this helps bridge that gap,” he said.“It should be said that Socios have usually been very clever with these launches - I can’t think of any that were headline failures, even in the overall crypto bear market - but there’s a reason that they’ve been stepping them up as of late.“It just hits right in the current moment that sports entertainment finds itself in.”Edwards said fan tokens were growing in popularity at the same time as a new type of digital asset - known as a non-fungible token (NFT) - has exploded in popularity during the pandemic as enthusiasts and investors scramble to spend enormous sums of money on items that only exist online.Giorgio Ricci, Chief Revenue Officer at Italian champions Juventus, stressed that there is more to the tokens than just revenue generation however.“(It) is not just a short-term fix to the problems brought on by the pandemic,” he said.“It’s a solution to the longer-term issue of how to engage with the 99% of fans that aren’t able to watch games from the stadium or ever set foot in Turin.“In normal circumstances our stadium holds 41,000 people, but recent estimates suggest our global fanbase is around 400 million, many of whom are thousands of miles away,” he added.(This story corrects typo in first paragraph)",Reuters
1023,"To go electric, America needs more mines. Can it build them?
Last September, in the arid hills of northern Nevada, a cluster of flowers found nowhere else on earth died mysteriously overnight.
MAR 02 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-insight/to-go-electric-america-needs-more-mines-can-it-build-them-idUSKCN2AT39Z,"(Reuters) - Last September, in the arid hills of northern Nevada, a cluster of flowers found nowhere else on earth died mysteriously overnight.Conservationists were quick to suspect ioneer Ltd, an Australian firm that wants to mine the lithium that lies beneath the flowers for use in electric vehicle (EV) batteries.One conservation group alleged in a lawsuit that the flowers, known as Tiehm’s buckwheat, were “dug up and destroyed.” The rare plant posed a problem for ioneer because U.S. officials may soon add it to the Endangered Species List, which could scuttle the mining project.Ioneer denies harming the flowers. Their cause of death remains hotly debated - as does the fate of the lithium mine.The clash of environmental priorities underpinning the battle over Tiehm’s buckwheat - conservation vs. green energy - is a microcosm of a much larger political quandary for the new administration of President Joe Biden, who has made big promises to environmentalists as well as labor groups and others who stand to benefit by boosting mining.To please conservationists, Biden has vowed to set aside at least 30% of U.S. federal land and coastal areas for conservation, triple current levels.But that aim could conflict with his promises to hasten the electrification of vehicles and to reduce the country’s dependence on China for rare earths, lithium and other minerals needed for EV batteries. The administration has called the reliance on China a national security threat.The administration will be forced into hard choices that anger one constituency or another.“You can’t have green energy without mining,” Mark Senti, chief executive of Florida-based rare earth magnet company Advanced Magnet Lab Inc. “That’s just the reality.”Rare earth magnets are used to make a range of consumer electronics as well as precision-guided missiles and other weapons.Two sources familiar with White House deliberations on domestic mining told Reuters that Biden plans to allow mines that produce EV metals to be developed under existing environmental standards, rather than face a tightened process that would apply to mining for other materials, such as coal.Biden is open to allowing more mines on federal land, the sources said, but won’t give the industry carte blanche to dig everywhere. That will likely mean approval of mines for rare earths and lithium, though certain copper projects – including a proposed Arizona copper mine from Rio Tinto Plc opposed by Native Americans - are likely to face extra scrutiny, the sources said.The White House declined to comment for this article.Demand for metals used in EV batteries is expected to rise sharply as automakers including Tesla Inc, BMW and General Motors plan major expansions of EV production. California, the biggest U.S. vehicle market, aims to entirely ban fossil fuel-powered engines by 2035.Biden has promised to convert the entire U.S. government fleet - about 640,000 vehicles - to EVs. That plan alone could require a 12-fold increase in U.S. lithium production by 2030, according to Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, as well as increases in output of domestic copper, nickel and cobalt. Federal land is teeming with many of these EV metals, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.“There is no way there’s enough raw materials being produced right now to start replacing millions of gasoline-powered motor vehicles with EVs,” said Lewis Black, CEO of Almonty Industries Inc, which mines the hardening metal tungsten in Portugal and South Korea.Despite that shortage, proposed U.S. mines from Rio Tinto Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Antofagasta Plc, Lithium Americas Corp, Glencore Plc and others are drawing stiff opposition from conservation groups. The projects would supply enough lithium for more than 5 million EV batteries and enough copper for more than 10,000 EVs each year.Mining companies insist that federal lands can still be protected while the U.S. boosts output of minerals needed to accelerate the EV transition.Former U.S. President Donald Trump and the mining industry “pushed the narrative that we need to mine everywhere and undercut environmental safeguards in order to build more batteries,” said Drew McConville of The Wilderness Society, a conservation group. “We have confidence that the Biden administration is going to see through that false narrative.”Earthworks and other environmental groups are now lobbying automakers to only buy metals from mines deemed environmentally friendly by the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), a nonprofit group. BMW, Ford Motor Co and Daimler have agreed to abide by IRMA guidelines, and other automakers may follow suit.Biden has not weighed in on two controversial copper mine projects in Minnesota’s environmentally-sensitive Boundary Waters region from PolyMet Mining Corp and Antofagasta Plc’s Twin Metals subsidiary.Tom Vilsack - the secretary of agriculture, the department that oversees the Boundary Waters - has in the past opposed the Twin Metals project, arguing that it threatened wilderness and marshlands.Deb Haaland, the new secretary of interior, the department that controls most federal land, previously voted for a bill that would have banned copper sulfide mining in northern Minnesota. That bill, authored by U.S. Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, will be reintroduced this month, her aides told Reuters.Conservationists nonetheless remain concerned that the appeal of copper for EVs and other renewable energy devices may help the mines ultimately get approved.“If these were coal mines, I’d feel much more comfortable knowing they wouldn’t be approved,” said Pete Marshall of Friends of the Boundary Waters.In Arizona, Biden promised Native Americans - whose votes helped him win the battleground state - that they would have a “seat at the table” if he defeated Trump. Many Native Americans are worried that Rio Tinto’s Resolution proposed copper mine would destroy sacred sites considered home to religious deities.On Monday afternoon, Biden administration officials blocked a land swap Rio needs to build the mine. Trump officials had previously approved that land swap.Other controversial projects include Idaho’s Stibnite proposed mine, from John Paulson-backed Perpetua Resources Corp, which is under fresh scrutiny by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staff over fears it would pollute Native American fishing grounds. The mine would produce gold and antimony, used to make alloys for EV batteries.In Nevada, the Department of Wildlife worries that the lithium mines planned by Lithium Americas and others would harm trout, deer and pronghorn habitats. The Lithium Americas mine received federal approval last month, but ranchers have sued the U.S. government to reverse that decision.“Renewable energy and electric cars aren’t green if they destroy an important habitat and drive wildlife extinct,” said Kelly Fuller, of the Western Watersheds Project, which opposes the Lithium Americas project.In Nevada, the death of the Tiehm’s buckwheat flowers at ioneer’s proposed mine site remains a point of contention. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that thirsty squirrels may have gnawed the roots of more than 17,000 flowers for water amid a drought in the state.The Center for Biological Diversity, which opposes the mine, said there was evidence that humans destroyed the flowers. “The targeted nature of the damage, combined with the lack of feces, pawprints, hoofprints, or other evidence of wildlife suggest human involvement,” the group said in a court filing.The Fish and Wildlife Service is now set to rule this summer on whether the flower is an endangered species - a designation that would prevent development on much of the land ioneer is trying to mine.Ioneer has hired scientists to move the flowers to a new site, though it’s unclear if that process will succeed. “We can extract this lithium and also save this flower,” said James Calaway, ioneer’s chairman.",Reuters

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought a formal end to eight lingering disputes pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the Nov. 3 presidential election including a Republican challenge to the extension of Pennsylvania's deadline to receive mail-in ballots.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election/u-s-supreme-court-formally-pulls-the-plug-on-election-related-cases-idUSKBN2AM1S1,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday brought a formal end to eight lingering disputes pursued by former President Donald Trump and his allies related to the Nov. 3 presidential election including a Republican challenge to the extension of Pennsylvania’s deadline to receive mail-in ballots.The justices turned away appeals by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and Republican members of the state legislature of a ruling by Pennsylvania’s top court ordering officials to count mail-in ballots that were postmarked by Election Day and received up to three days later.Three of the nine-member court’s six conservative justices - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch - dissented from the decision not to hear the Pennsylvania case.Trump, a Republican, lost his re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden, who took office on Jan. 20. Biden defeated Trump by more than 80,000 votes in Pennsylvania and the legal case focused on fewer than 10,000 ballots.The high court, as expected, also rejected two Trump appeals challenging Biden’s victories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin based on claims that the rules for mail-in ballots in the two election battleground states were invalid. The court also turned away separate cases brought by Trump allies in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Arizona - all states won by Biden.It already was clear that the high court had no intention to intervene in the cases because it did not act before Congress on Jan. 6 certified Biden’s victory. That formal certification was interrupted when a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. The court also turned down motions to expedite the election cases.Trump made false claims that the presidential election was stolen from him through widespread voting fraud and irregularities.The case brought by Pennsylvania Republicans concerned 9,428 ballots out of 6.9 million cast in the state. The Supreme Court previously rejected a Republican request to block the lower court ruling allowing the ballots to be counted.In his dissent, Thomas said the Supreme Court should resolve whether non-legislators, including elections officials and courts, have any power to set election rules. Thomas said it was fortunate that the state high court’s ruling did not involve enough ballots to affect the election’s outcome.“But we may not be so lucky in the future,” Thomas wrote.The election dispute in Pennsylvania, like in several other states, involved changes implemented to facilitate voting during the coronavirus pandemic, a public health crisis that prompted a surge in mail-in ballots as voters sought to avoid crowded polling places.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court sided with the state’s Democratic Party and various Democratic officials and candidates who argued that an Election Day mail-in ballot receipt deadline would violate the state constitution’s guarantee of “free and equal” elections given the pandemic and warnings by the U.S. Postal Service over its ability to deliver ballots in time.The state Republican Party intervened in the case to oppose the deadline extension. It argued that the state court usurped the Republican-controlled legislature’s authority in ordering the extension.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, told the justices in a filing that particularly given Trump’s repeated attempts to overturn the election result based on unfounded claims of voting fraud, “the court should not plunge itself into the political thicket by granting a case that will not affect the outcome of any election.”",Reuters

1026,"Analysis: Fed's Powell set table for Biden economy, but will he stay for dessert?",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-analysis/analysis-feds-powell-set-table-for-biden-economy-but-will-he-stay-for-dessert-idUSKBN2AM121,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Over the past year Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has engineered the largest economic rescue in U.S. history, thrown a controversial lifeline to companies hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic and steered a sweeping labor-friendly revamp of monetary policy that any presidential administration would welcome.Is it enough to earn the 68-year-old former investment banker four more years as the head of the U.S. central bank?That question will get increased attention during this, the final year of Powell’s term, and the conversation may start as early as this week when the Fed chief delivers his semi-annual update on the economy in two hearings before Congress.The testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday will be Powell’s first since President Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats took control of the White House and Capitol Hill.While the body of work Powell can show Biden on monetary policy is extensive - so much so that there’d seem little reason to replace him when his term expires next February - he may face scrutiny over the Fed’s moves to relax regulations on financial institutions.Those steps were often opposed by the left flank of the Democratic Party as well as Fed Governor Lael Brainard, a 59-year-old economist who is seen as the most likely person to replace Powell if Biden decides to put out a “Help Wanted” sign.Brainard is prominent in Democratic policy circles and has played a key role in shaping Fed policy since she was appointed to the U.S. central bank in 2014 after serving in the Obama administration’s Treasury Department.Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are among the progressives who opposed Powell’s appointment as Fed chief in 2018, as did then-Senator Kamala Harris, who is now Biden’s vice president. The hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee, of which Warren is a member, may provide a gauge of how deep that opposition still runs.“Is there anything else this White House could, if it was inclined to, ask of the Fed? Not much,” Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chair who is now a Princeton University professor, said of a central bank that is locked firmly into a pledge to get the economy back to full employment as fast as possible. That’s also the Biden administration’s top economic priority.“Biden is going to be quite happy with the performance of the Fed chair. The market is going to be quite happy with the performance of the Fed chair. (Treasury Secretary and former Fed chief Janet) Yellen will only have good things to say. But there will be Democrats urging him to replace Powell with a Democrat.”Politics traditionally has not been a concern when it comes to the Fed, an institution expected to stay out of Washington’s partisan battles, and one where U.S. presidents have often crossed party lines to reappoint their predecessors’ picks for the central bank’s top job. Along with guiding U.S. monetary policy, the Fed chief is perhaps the most influential official in global finance.Reappointing Powell would restore a bipartisan approach, as well as continue policies that, step by step, have been elevating issues Biden often cites, including advancing racial equity.A moderate by temperament, Powell over the past two years had the Fed delve deep into how the central bank influences the job market. In the end, policymakers not only decided they could do much more to champion the cause of attaining maximum employment - one of the central bank’s two statutory mandates - but redefined the concept as something that needed to be “broad-based and inclusive.”“Powell is fully committed to the president’s priorities of getting the economy back to full employment as fast as possible, and easing the financial stress on low-income households and disadvantaged groups,” said Moody’s Analytics economist Mark Zandi, who expects Powell to get another four-year term.Enter the politics.Powell, a Republican, past private equity executive, and native of the suburban professional class enclave of Chevy Chase, Maryland, was first appointed to the Fed's Board of Governors in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama. He has spent more time than his predecessors cultivating lawmakers here from both parties  in Congress. Those relationships could mean, for Biden, a potentially pain-free reconfirmation for a key economic policy maker in broad alignment with the president's agenda - and stability where it matters.But Powell was also the man former President Donald Trump promoted to replace Yellen, in a move that not only broke the bipartisan mold, but did so in favor of someone with arguably lesser economic credentials.At the time, Powell had hoped to become the Fed’s vice chair to oversee financial regulation, a role well-aligned with his career as a Wall Street lawyer and investor. His leap to the top job was unexpected, and he would readily acknowledge Yellen’s influence over his own understanding of the position.After a year in which the Fed itself has discussed openly its institutional weaknesses in diversity as well as past blindness to how its policies failed many workers, there may be more than a few calls for Biden to put his mark on the central bank’s leadership.Dennis Kelleher, president of the Better Markets think tank and a member of the Biden transition team on the Fed and regulatory issues, said Powell can be lauded for his handling of the current crisis but should also be held to account for the central bank’s regulatory decisions - terrain where Brainard’s dissenting votes “are a very good road map to where and how far they got the deregulation wrong.”For example, under Powell and Randal Quarles, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, the central bank has rolled back restrictions on certain trading activities by banks and given them more advance information about their annual stress tests. A Trump appointee, Quarles’ term expires in the fall, giving Biden yet more scope to reshape the Fed.”When you add up the deregulation by the Federal Reserve under the Trump administration it amounts to a significant weakening of critical financial protection rules, and Chair Powell should be required to answer to that,” Kelleher said. “It is not the case that there are just one or two or three people who can do that job.”",Reuters
1027,"To go electric, America needs more mines. Can it build them?
Last September, in the arid hills of northern Nevada, a cluster of flowers found nowhere else on earth died mysteriously overnight.
MAR 02 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-insight/to-go-electric-america-needs-more-mines-can-it-build-them-idUSKCN2AT39Z,"(Reuters) - Last September, in the arid hills of northern Nevada, a cluster of flowers found nowhere else on earth died mysteriously overnight.Conservationists were quick to suspect ioneer Ltd, an Australian firm that wants to mine the lithium that lies beneath the flowers for use in electric vehicle (EV) batteries.One conservation group alleged in a lawsuit that the flowers, known as Tiehm’s buckwheat, were “dug up and destroyed.” The rare plant posed a problem for ioneer because U.S. officials may soon add it to the Endangered Species List, which could scuttle the mining project.Ioneer denies harming the flowers. Their cause of death remains hotly debated - as does the fate of the lithium mine.The clash of environmental priorities underpinning the battle over Tiehm’s buckwheat - conservation vs. green energy - is a microcosm of a much larger political quandary for the new administration of President Joe Biden, who has made big promises to environmentalists as well as labor groups and others who stand to benefit by boosting mining.To please conservationists, Biden has vowed to set aside at least 30% of U.S. federal land and coastal areas for conservation, triple current levels.But that aim could conflict with his promises to hasten the electrification of vehicles and to reduce the country’s dependence on China for rare earths, lithium and other minerals needed for EV batteries. The administration has called the reliance on China a national security threat.The administration will be forced into hard choices that anger one constituency or another.“You can’t have green energy without mining,” Mark Senti, chief executive of Florida-based rare earth magnet company Advanced Magnet Lab Inc. “That’s just the reality.”Rare earth magnets are used to make a range of consumer electronics as well as precision-guided missiles and other weapons.Two sources familiar with White House deliberations on domestic mining told Reuters that Biden plans to allow mines that produce EV metals to be developed under existing environmental standards, rather than face a tightened process that would apply to mining for other materials, such as coal.Biden is open to allowing more mines on federal land, the sources said, but won’t give the industry carte blanche to dig everywhere. That will likely mean approval of mines for rare earths and lithium, though certain copper projects – including a proposed Arizona copper mine from Rio Tinto Plc opposed by Native Americans - are likely to face extra scrutiny, the sources said.The White House declined to comment for this article.Demand for metals used in EV batteries is expected to rise sharply as automakers including Tesla Inc, BMW and General Motors plan major expansions of EV production. California, the biggest U.S. vehicle market, aims to entirely ban fossil fuel-powered engines by 2035.Biden has promised to convert the entire U.S. government fleet - about 640,000 vehicles - to EVs. That plan alone could require a 12-fold increase in U.S. lithium production by 2030, according to Benchmark Minerals Intelligence, as well as increases in output of domestic copper, nickel and cobalt. Federal land is teeming with many of these EV metals, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.“There is no way there’s enough raw materials being produced right now to start replacing millions of gasoline-powered motor vehicles with EVs,” said Lewis Black, CEO of Almonty Industries Inc, which mines the hardening metal tungsten in Portugal and South Korea.Despite that shortage, proposed U.S. mines from Rio Tinto Ltd, BHP Group Ltd, Antofagasta Plc, Lithium Americas Corp, Glencore Plc and others are drawing stiff opposition from conservation groups. The projects would supply enough lithium for more than 5 million EV batteries and enough copper for more than 10,000 EVs each year.Mining companies insist that federal lands can still be protected while the U.S. boosts output of minerals needed to accelerate the EV transition.Former U.S. President Donald Trump and the mining industry “pushed the narrative that we need to mine everywhere and undercut environmental safeguards in order to build more batteries,” said Drew McConville of The Wilderness Society, a conservation group. “We have confidence that the Biden administration is going to see through that false narrative.”Earthworks and other environmental groups are now lobbying automakers to only buy metals from mines deemed environmentally friendly by the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), a nonprofit group. BMW, Ford Motor Co and Daimler have agreed to abide by IRMA guidelines, and other automakers may follow suit.Biden has not weighed in on two controversial copper mine projects in Minnesota’s environmentally-sensitive Boundary Waters region from PolyMet Mining Corp and Antofagasta Plc’s Twin Metals subsidiary.Tom Vilsack - the secretary of agriculture, the department that oversees the Boundary Waters - has in the past opposed the Twin Metals project, arguing that it threatened wilderness and marshlands.Deb Haaland, the new secretary of interior, the department that controls most federal land, previously voted for a bill that would have banned copper sulfide mining in northern Minnesota. That bill, authored by U.S. Representative Betty McCollum, a Minnesota Democrat, will be reintroduced this month, her aides told Reuters.Conservationists nonetheless remain concerned that the appeal of copper for EVs and other renewable energy devices may help the mines ultimately get approved.“If these were coal mines, I’d feel much more comfortable knowing they wouldn’t be approved,” said Pete Marshall of Friends of the Boundary Waters.In Arizona, Biden promised Native Americans - whose votes helped him win the battleground state - that they would have a “seat at the table” if he defeated Trump. Many Native Americans are worried that Rio Tinto’s Resolution proposed copper mine would destroy sacred sites considered home to religious deities.On Monday afternoon, Biden administration officials blocked a land swap Rio needs to build the mine. Trump officials had previously approved that land swap.Other controversial projects include Idaho’s Stibnite proposed mine, from John Paulson-backed Perpetua Resources Corp, which is under fresh scrutiny by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency staff over fears it would pollute Native American fishing grounds. The mine would produce gold and antimony, used to make alloys for EV batteries.In Nevada, the Department of Wildlife worries that the lithium mines planned by Lithium Americas and others would harm trout, deer and pronghorn habitats. The Lithium Americas mine received federal approval last month, but ranchers have sued the U.S. government to reverse that decision.“Renewable energy and electric cars aren’t green if they destroy an important habitat and drive wildlife extinct,” said Kelly Fuller, of the Western Watersheds Project, which opposes the Lithium Americas project.In Nevada, the death of the Tiehm’s buckwheat flowers at ioneer’s proposed mine site remains a point of contention. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said that thirsty squirrels may have gnawed the roots of more than 17,000 flowers for water amid a drought in the state.The Center for Biological Diversity, which opposes the mine, said there was evidence that humans destroyed the flowers. “The targeted nature of the damage, combined with the lack of feces, pawprints, hoofprints, or other evidence of wildlife suggest human involvement,” the group said in a court filing.The Fish and Wildlife Service is now set to rule this summer on whether the flower is an endangered species - a designation that would prevent development on much of the land ioneer is trying to mine.Ioneer has hired scientists to move the flowers to a new site, though it’s unclear if that process will succeed. “We can extract this lithium and also save this flower,” said James Calaway, ioneer’s chairman.",Reuters

Boeing Co will use a pilotless, fighter-like jet developed in Australia as the basis for its U.S. Air Force Skyborg prototype, an executive at the plane maker said on Tuesday.

The plane can also carry weapons and act as a shield to help protect more expensive manned fighter jets.The U.S. Air Force in December awarded multi-million dollar contracts to Boeing, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and Kratos Defense and Security Solutions to produce unmanned aerial prototypes that can team with crewed jets.“The airpower teaming system is the basis for our Skyborg bid,” Boeing airpower teaming programme director Shane Arnott told reporters. “Obviously the U.S. market is a big market. That is a focus for us, achieving some sort of contract or programme of record in the United States.”Defence contractors are investing increasingly in autonomous technology as militaries around the world look for cheaper and safer ways to maximise their resources.Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, is home to Boeing’s largest footprint outside the United States and has vast airspace with relatively low traffic for flight testing.The Australian government said on Tuesday it would invest a further A$115 million ($89 million) to acquire three more Loyal Wingman aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to develop tactics for using the jets with crewed planes, on top of its initial investment of A$40 million.“Our aim with Boeing is to understand how we can get these aircraft to team with our existing aircraft to be a force multiplier in the future,” RAAF Air-Vice Marshal and head of air force capability Cath Roberts said.Britain in January signed a GBP 30 million ($42 million) contract with the Belfast unit of Spirit AeroSystems for a similar type of pilotless aircraft to have a trial flight in the next three years.During the test flight in Australia, the Loyal Wingman took off under its own power before flying a pre-determined route at different speeds and altitudes to verify its functionality and demonstrate the performance of the design.Arnott said that three Loyal Wingman aircraft would be used for teaming flights this year and that the Australian government’s order would take the number available to six.Boeing has said up to 16 Loyal Wingman jets could be teamed with a crewed aircraft for missions.($1 = 1.2900 Australian dollars)($1 = 0.7200 pounds)",Reuters

Nio launched its first sedan model ET7 in January.Nio shares soared over 10-fold last year, with its market capitalization overtaking that of Detroit automakers Ford and General Motors, as China led the global automobile industry’s recovery from the pandemic. But as of Monday’s close, its stock is up only 2% this year.It reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 1.49 billion yuan ($230 million), compared with the average estimate from analysts for a 757 million yuan loss, according to Refinitiv data.($1 = 6.4648 Chinese yuan)",Reuters

It said it strives for an equitable culture and has no tolerance for discrimination: “These allegations do not reflect those efforts or our values.”The complaint was filed in Washington, D.C., federal court.Newman, a Harvard Business School graduate and former adviser to U.S. Senator Cory Booker, said Amazon delayed by 2-1/2 years her rise to senior manager by hiring her in 2017 for a more junior role for which she was overqualified, a “de-leveling” that reduces awards of company stock.She also accused a male supervisor of using racial tropes by calling her “aggressive,” “too direct” and “just scary,” and another male co-worker of sexually harassing her and once pulling on her braids while saying, “You can leave this behind.”Both men were also named as defendants, and according to the lawsuit the supervisor was required to undergo training while the co-worker was terminated. The co-worker’s lawyer could not immediately be identified.Newman is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. She is represented by Douglas Wigdor, who also represented women suing the former movie producer Harvey Weinstein and Fox News over alleged harassment or discrimination.Amazon has worked to show support for the Black Lives Matter movement. In September its cloud computing chief Andy Jassy, who will succeed Bezos as Amazon CEO, gave the keynote address at a Black Employee Network entrepreneurship conference.The news site Recode last week reported allegations of racial disparities in Amazon promotions and performance reviews.Amazon also faces lawsuits claiming it mistreated workers in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic at its facilities.",Reuters

The daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei is accused by the United States of misleading HSBC about her company’s business arrangements in Iran, causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions.Meng, 49, was arrested at Vancouver’s airport in December 2018 on a U.S. warrant and has been living under house arrest while her case makes its way through Canada’s courts.Defence lawyer Frank Addario kicked off a new phase of hearings with an assertion that HSBC’s global client relationship manager, tasked with overseeing its dealings with Huawei Technologies, knew that Huawei controlled Skycom Tech Co Ltd’s accounts.U.S. prosecutors allege Skycom operated as a Huawei affiliate in Iran and that Meng misrepresented this relationship. Meng allegedly made statements suggesting Skycom was sold to an arms-length third party, according to the prosecutors, when it was in fact sold to a parent company controlled by Huawei.Addario countered that HSBC employee emails show that information about Huawei's control of Skycom was shared freely before and after this relationship was first reported by Reuters. (reut.rs/3q0dtIc)Addario said that U.S. prosecutors’ evidence that HSBC made decisions based on Meng’s statements “is very misleading in that it underplays the global relationship manager’s knowledge.”Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater opposed Addario’s call to admit new evidence on Monday afternoon, insisting that an extradition hearing is not a trial. He told the judge she’s “not here to draw inferences about their (the bank employees) state of knowledge.”Frater argued that Meng’s defence lawyers will have an opportunity to cross-examine bank witnesses about their knowledge of Huawei’s affiliates at trial.Following testimony from Canadian border officials and police officers involved in the case in late 2020, the latest hearings will also focus on then-President Donald Trump’s alleged interference in the case, as well as outstanding issues from witness testimony and other abuses of process arguments.Meng’s arrest caused tensions between Beijing and Ottawa, and soon afterward, China detained two Canadians, who continue to have limited access to legal counsel or diplomatic officials.Meng’s case is scheduled to wrap in May.(This story drops reference to South District of New York in paragraph nine)",Reuters

U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Friday he opposes President Joe Biden's nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget, imperiling her chances of getting the job and introducing a new obstacle for the Democrats' agenda.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-omb/u-s-democrat-opposes-biden-budget-pick-tanden-risking-confirmation-and-complicating-agenda-idUSKBN2AJ2I6,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Joe Manchin said on Friday he opposes President Joe Biden’s nomination of Neera Tanden to head the Office of Management and Budget, imperiling her chances of getting the job and introducing a new obstacle for the Democrats’ agenda.Biden told reporters he did not intend to pull the nomination. “I think we’re gonna find the votes to get her confirmed,” Biden said.Tanden has been criticized by Republicans - and some Democrats - over past harsh comments on social media, such as calling Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell “Moscow Mitch” and saying “vampires have more heart than (Senator) Ted Cruz.”Many Democrats scoffed at such concerns, noting near-unanimous Republican support for former President Donald Trump, who was accused of inciting a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol partly via inflammatory comments on Twitter and was known for blasting opponents - particularly women - as “nasty” or criminals who should be locked up.Manchin cited Tanden’s “public statements and tweets” in his statement. “I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” he said.His statement drew immediate condemnation, with some critics noting that the moderate Democrat - who represents the strongly Republican state of West Virginia - had backed some of Trump’s controversial nominees, including Richard Grenell to be ambassador to Germany.Democrats had questioned Grenell’s appointment because of his past statements insulting to women politicians on the internet and during cable television appearances.Manchin’s opposition underscored the influence that the moderate Democrat has over the ability of Biden’s Democrats to achieve the party’s policy goals, given their narrow control of the House and Senate.His statement came as congressional Democrats look to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill by the end of next week. Facing stiff Republican opposition, that measure could also hinge on Manchin.If every Senate Democrat had supported Tanden, she could have been confirmed without Republican votes since Democrats control 50 seats in the chamber and Vice President Kamala Harris can break a tie.However, Manchin’s opposition means Tanden must be supported by a least one Republican.Tanden, who is Indian-American, would be the first woman of color to serve as director of the OMB, which serves as gatekeeper for the $4 trillion federal budget.Questioned at her confirmation hearings about her tweets, Tanden apologized and said she regretted their tone.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki praised Tanden as “an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent Budget Director.” She said the administration would keep working toward her confirmation by engaging with both parties.If Tanden is not confirmed, it would be a setback in a presidential transition that was already delayed by Trump’s refusal - backed by many of his fellow Republicans - to recognize Biden’s victory in the November election even after repeated court decisions showed there had been no widespread fraud.So far, the handful of Biden nominees to have come before the Senate, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have been confirmed by comfortable margins with bipartisan support.Biden could also install Tanden as director of OMB by making her a recess appointment, a temporary measure that could her allow to run the office for nearly two years.",Reuters
1038,Biden draws sharp contrast with Trump in presidential debut on world stage,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-g7-meeting-biden/biden-draws-sharp-contrast-with-trump-in-presidential-debut-on-world-stage-idUSKBN2AJ11Y,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday drew a sharp contrast with the foreign policy of his much-derided predecessor, Donald Trump, and urged democracies to work together to challenge abuses by autocratic states such as China and Russia.In his first big appearance as president on the global stage, an online “virtual visit” to Europe, Biden sought to re-establish the United States as a multilateral team player after four years of divisive “America First” policies under Trump.Speaking to the Munich Security Conference, the Democratic president distanced himself from the more transactional foreign policy of Republican Trump, who angered allies by breaking off global accords and threatening to end defense assistance unless they toed his line.“I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined - determined - to re-engage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership,” he said.Several years ago as a private citizen at the Munich Security Conference, Biden reassured participants rattled by the Trump presidency, telling them: “We will be back.” On Friday, he told the virtual online audience: “America is back.”Biden’s focus on collaboration echoed his message during a private videoconference earlier on Friday with the leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, a senior administration official said.Biden plans to join G7 members for an in-person summit hosted by Britain in June. His spokeswoman said he would not ask Russia to join the group, as had been proposed by Trump.U.S. partnerships had survived because they were “rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values,” Biden said. “They’re not transactional. They’re not extractive. They’re built on a vision of the future where every voice matters.”He said U.S. allies must stand firm against the challenges posed by China, Iran and Russia.“The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance,” he said. “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin seeks to weaken the European project and our NATO alliance. He wants to undermine our transatlantic unity and our resolve,” Biden said.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any such action.Biden stressed what he called America’s “unshakeable” commitment to the 30-member NATO alliance, another switch from Trump, who called NATO outdated and even suggested at one point that Washington could withdraw from the alliance.Biden also arrived bearing gifts - a $4 billion pledge of support for global coronavirus vaccination efforts, the re-entry of the United States into the Paris climate accord and the prospect of a nearly $2 trillion spending measure that could bolster both the U.S. and global economies.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined other leaders in cheering Biden’s remarks.“America is unreservedly back as the leader of the free world and that is a fantastic thing,” he told the conference.Biden said the world was at an inflection point, but he was convinced that democracies, not autocracies, offered the best path forward for the world.He said major market economies and democracies needed to work together to tackle challenges posed by great-power competitors like Russia and China, and global issues ranging from nuclear proliferation to climate change and cybersecurity.He took particular aim at China, the world’s second largest economy, and its failure to abide by international standards, arguing that democracies must shape the rules to govern the advance of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.“We have to push back against the Chinese government’s economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system,” he said.Chinese companies, he said, should be held to the same standards that applied to U.S. and European companies.“We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression,” he said.The Biden White House is reviewing China policy across all fronts, including China’s military buildup and trade policies, its actions in Hong Kong, treatment of minority Uighurs in Xinjiang and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.On the challenge posed by Iran’s nuclear program, Biden said the United States looked forward to re-engaging in diplomacy amid efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.The G7 countries, which control a little under half of the world economy, sought at their meeting to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic towards rebuilding their economies with free trade and countering China’s “non-market oriented” policies.",Reuters

(Reuters) - Artificial intelligence chip designer Wave Computing Inc said on Monday it has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following an auction of the company and will rebrand the firm as MIPS.The company traces its origins back to MIPS Computer Systems Inc, cofounded more than 35 years ago by Stanford University professor John Hennessy, who is now chairman of Alphabet Inc. MIPS was the commercial home of an earlier academic effort to create an architecture for computer processors that remain in wide use today by firms such as Intel Corp’s Mobileye self-driving car unit.Wave Computing filed for bankruptcy in April. It was revealed by bankruptcy filings and Reuters reporting that in late 2018 and 2019, the company licensed its core computing architecture for use in China, Hong Kong and Macau to a Shanghai-based firm, CIP United Co Ltd, in a complex series of transactions. The transactions occurred just as a chip war was escalating between the United States and China, which could have made it more difficult for Chinese firms to use MIPS’s technology.According to two sources, CIP has kept the scope of that license even as the company emerges from bankruptcy. CIP was not immediately available for comment. Wave Computing was not immediately able for comment on the CIP license.Wave Computing said Tallwood Venture Capital won the auction with a bid valued at $61 million and has sole ownership of the company. It also said two previous Chinese investors, Alibaba Investment Limited and venture capital fund Canyon Bridge Fund I, are no longer shareholders. The former is the investment arm of China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Wave Computing also said it will further develop its chip architecture based on the open source RISC-V architecture, which has attracted attention from Chinese companies who see it as a path forward for China’s chip independence as it is not controlled by any company or government.",Reuters

Bitcoin rose nearly 7% on Monday as risk assets rallied after last week's bond rout cooled, with Citi saying the most popular cryptocurrency was at a ""tipping point"" and could become the preferred currency for international trade.

Smaller rival ether rallied 6.8% to $1,517.Bitcoin’s recent performance has come with the growing involvement of institutional investors in recent years, contrasting with its heavy retail investor focus for most of the past decade, Citi said.If businesses and individuals gain access via digital wallets to planned central bank digital cash and so-called stablecoins, bitcoin’s global reach, traceability and potential for quick payments would see it “optimally positioned” to become the preferred currency for international trade, Citi added.Bitcoin, designed as a payment tool, is little used for commerce in major economies, hampered by high volatility and relatively costly transactions. Yet it has gained traction over in some emerging markets, such as Nigeria, over the past year.Such a dramatic transformation to the de facto currency of world trade - a status currently held by the dollar - would depend on changes to bitcoin’s market to allow wider institutional participation and closer oversight by financial regulators, Citi said.Still, shifts in the macroeconomic environment could also make the demand for bitcoin less pressing, it added.The recent surge in interest, sparked by a narrative that bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation, has driven it to a record high and a $1 trillion market capitalization.But it has pulled back more than $11,000 from those levels in the past week on questions over the sustainability of such high prices.New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday warned investors to take “extreme caution when investing in virtual currencies”.Graphic: Bitcoin's surge from March lows -",Reuters

It also aimed to remove demonstrably false or misleading content about the virus that had the highest risk of causing harm.Since introducing its COVID-19 guidance, it said it had removed more than 8,400 tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts.With more and more people now looking for authoritative public health information about vaccines as programs were rolled out across the world, it said it would expand the guidance.Katy Minshall, Twitter’s head of UK public policy, said the company recognised the role it played in giving people credible public health information.“We continue to work with health authorities around the world - including (Britain’s health service) the NHS - to ensure high visibility access to trusted and accurate public health information on our service, including about COVID-19 vaccines,” she told Reuters.“Today we will begin applying labels to tweets that may contain misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines, in addition to our continued efforts to remove the most harmful COVID-19 misleading information from the service.”She said the approach built on existing work to guard against false claims about the safety and effectiveness of inoculation.Vaccines are at the centre of government plans to fight the pandemic that has caused more than 2.6 million deaths to date.There have been concerns, however, that public distrust of the shots could jeopardize the success of vaccination programs.Surveys and data show varying levels of willingness to receive a shot according to country and demographic group.In Britain, where more than a third of adults have received at least one vaccine shot, authorities are working to overcome hesitancy among some ethnic groups.",Reuters

The largest cryptocurrency is seen by investors and some companies as a hedge against inflation as governments and central banks turn on the stimulus taps.While its price has risen significantly over the past year, bitcoin remains highly volatile. The virtual currency smashed through $58,000 on February 21 then fell back by as much as 25% but has recovered some lost ground.This makes the coin and related derivatives attractive for investors willing to take riskier long or short positions as they hunt for yield in a record-low interest rate environment.Non-deliverable forwards are a type of derivative that allows investors to take a view on bitcoin’s future price.Goldman first set up a cryptocurrency desk in 2018, just as bitcoin’s price was falling from record highs, muting investor interest in digital coins.Since then, market infrastructure for bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies has significantly matured, with many established financial institutions offering products and services, including CME Group Inc, Intercontinental Exchange Inc and Fidelity.The developments have helped to attract more mainstream companies to the sector, ranging from those offering crypto services to retail or institutional investors, to companies opting to hold bitcoin on their balance sheetsLast month, electric car manufacturer Tesla Inc said it had bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, while Bank of New York Mellon Corp said it had formed a new unit to help clients hold and transfer digital assets.",Reuters

Such chips are used in surveillance technologies such as facial recognition. (Report: bit.ly/3r64feX)“China is making an aggressive push to promote authoritarianism around the world,” an NSCAI official told Reuters. “It boils down to semiconductors.”Much chipmaking equipment comes from U.S. firms such as Applied Materials Inc and Lam Research Corp which are already subject to American export controls. But key gear also comes from firms such as Nikon Corp and Canon Inc in Japan and ASML Holding in the Netherlands.The report recommends that the United States coordinate with those countries to create a policy of “presumptive denial” in each country for export licenses of advanced chipmaking tools to China. The report also recommends formalizing into U.S. policy a longstanding regulatory practice of limiting China’s semiconductor industry to two generations behind the United States.In addition to steps to protect U.S. and allied chipmaking technology, the report also recommends measures to promote semiconductor manufacturing in America after decades industry migration to Taiwan and Korea.The $35 billion in proposals for grants and funding for chip plants and research overlaps with $37 billion in chip industry measures that President Joe Biden pledged to support last week.The commission also calls for a 40% investment tax credit for semiconductor tools, which it says would spur chip factory construction in the United States as well as benefit American toolmakers.“Our No. 1 ‘protect’ strategy is to run faster” than China’s chip industry, the NSCAI official said.",Reuters

At $31 billion, the company’s value is comparable to major financial houses such as Barclays, Credit Suisse and Swiss Re and is larger than Germany’s biggest lender Deutsche Bank.Klarna Chief Executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski told Reuters he believes there was more opportunity ahead.“If you look at this valuation and compare it to some of the large retail banks in this whole industry, we are still a fraction of the opportunity that’s out there,” he said in an interview.Question marks over the “buy now pay later” business model have arisen during the COVID-19 crisis, with Britain among countries looking to bring in new legislation to protect consumers from over-extending themselves.But investors seem undeterred, and the latest deal caps a meteoric rise in value for Klarna, which completed a $650 million funding round in September from a group of investors led by Silver Lake that valued it at $11 billion.More than 30 new and existing investors took part in the latest funding round with no investor playing the role of an anchor, a source familiar with the matter said.“Spotting early success stories like Klarna and watching them grow into global unicorns is what makes us so bullish about the future of European tech,” said Hans Otterling, a partner at venture capital firm Northzone, an early investor in Klarna.Klarna has been widely rumoured to be among a number of looming tech company listings, with bankers expecting it to complete a New York initial public offering (IPO) or a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) - a listed vehicle created to bring private companies to market.However, Siemiatkowski ruled out a SPAC deal in an earlier interview with Reuters last week and confirmed that the firm was considering a direct listing - a variation on a stock market listing that circumvents the costly marketing process of an IPO.Klarna also said it would pledge 1% of the capital raised to a newly created initiative that focuses on key sustainability challenges around the world and would launch on April 22 on World Earth Day.Siemiatkowski said he hoped the sustainability initiative may inspire other successful tech companies or fintechs and have a “a big, meaningful impact”.",Reuters

CEO Tim Hoettges told reporters on Friday that Deutsche Telekom planned to put in a bid.Health Minister Jens Spahn wants the vaccination passports ready in 12 weeks as part of EU plans under which they would serve as proof that a holder is vaccinated or has recovered from the viral disease and thus have a degree of protection against the disease.The EU executive aims to present its plans for a “digital green pass” on March 17 and to cooperate with international organisations to ensure its system also works beyond the EU, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday.Deutsche Telekom, which is partly state owned, co-designed a German smartphone app that uses Bluetooth short-range radio chatter between devices to pinpoint and alert those at risk of catching COVID-19.The Corona Warn App, which has been downloaded nearly 26 million times, was created in partnership with SAP. The business software group said, however, that it was not part of the bid for the digital vaccination passport.U.S. software giant Microsoft declined to comment on reports that it was participating in the tender.Germany already uses passport-sized yellow booklets to keep an individual’s vaccination record.

Pomerantz started on Feb. 2 as special assistant district attorney, said Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance.Pomerantz’s hiring is part of a flurry of recent activity in Vance’s investigation, including the issuance in recent days of roughly a dozen new subpoenas, according to the sources. One of those went to Ladder Capital Finance LLC, a major creditor used by Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, to finance the former president’s commercial real estate holdings, the sources said.Vance’s office has also conducted interviews with Ladder’s staff, one source familiar with the matter said. Ladder did not reply to requests for comment.The district attorney’s office has said little publicly about the probe, but noted in court filings that it was focused on “possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct” at the Trump Organization, including alleged falsification of records, and insurance and tax fraud. It is the only known criminal inquiry into Trump’s business practices.Separately, New York state Attorney General Letitia James is leading a civil probe into whether Trump’s company falsely reported property values to secure loans and obtain economic and tax benefits.Ladder issued the loans on several of Trump’s big commercial holdings, including a $160 million mortgage on the Trump Building, a skyscraper in Manhattan’s financial district.It was unclear what was covered in Cohen’s interview on Thursday with Pomerantz - his fifth with Vance’s office. But it signals intense interest in Cohen’s intimate knowledge of the financial affairs of the Trump Organization.Cohen declined to comment. A representative for Trump and a lawyer for the Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment. Frost, Vance’s spokesman, declined to comment on areas of the inquiry beyond Pomerantz’s appointment.In court filings, the Trump Organization has denied that the company inflated assets. Trump, a Republican, has described the New York investigations as politically motivated. Vance and James are both Democrats.To look for anomalies among property deals, Vance’s office has retained forensic accounting specialists from Washington-based FTI Consulting Inc, a person familiar with the investigation said. An FTI spokesman declined to comment.Cohen, who describes himself as Trump’s longtime, do-anything fixer, is in home confinement serving a three-year sentence on charges related to payoffs he made during the 2016 presidential race to buy the silence of two women who alleged they had affairs with Trump.Vance opened the investigation in 2018 to examine the alleged hush-money payments. The probe has since expanded to include Trump’s conduct as a private business owner and whether the Trump Organization engaged in criminal tax evasion among other charges.Pomerantz, 69, was chief of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York from 1997 to 1999 and oversaw a successful racketeering case against former Gambino crime family boss John “Junior” Gotti.As a private attorney, Pomerantz has regularly represented major companies and officials in state and federal prosecutions, including cases brought by the U.S. Department of Justice. He has handled matters involving charges of corporate misconduct, financial fraud, tax crimes and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), a federal law used to prosecute organized crime and ongoing criminal activities.Pomerantz, who has taken a leave of absence from his law firm, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his involvement in the district attorney’s investigation.Cohen, a potential high-profile witness for Vance, pleaded guilty in 2018 to charges in the hush-money case, as well as allegations of lying to Congress about negotiations concerning a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow, a project that never materialized.Trump and Republicans in Congress have sought to undermine Cohen’s credibility by underscoring how he lied under oath. At his sentencing hearing, Cohen said he took “full responsibility” for his actions, but said the payments were made “in coordination” and “at the direction” of Trump in an effort to influence the election’s outcome.He also said Trump implicitly directed him to lie about the Moscow project.Trump accused Cohen of lying to reduce his prison time.“I think Cohen may be more valuable than people are giving him credit for,” said Daniel Alonso, Vance’s top deputy from 2010 to 2014 and now in private practice.“He obviously has committed perjury. He has credibility issues. But the perjury he committed was allegedly at the behest of Donald Trump, at least tacitly. I don’t think that calling Cohen a perjurer ends the story, because that opens the door to the explanation of why he perjured himself.”",Reuters

In hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,” the 50-year-old Republican told reporters as he returned to Houston.Cruz said he had planned to stay through the weekend, but had second thoughts “almost the moment I sat down on the plane.”In text messages obtained by American Bridge, a Democratic political group, Cruz’s wife Heidi asked neighbors whether they wanted to accompany the family to Cancun.“Anyone can or want to leave for the week?” she wrote, noting that rooms at the city’s Ritz Carlton cost “$309 plus tax.”With millions of Texans grappling with the fallout from a ferocious winter storm, Cruz, viewed as a presidential hopeful in 2024, faced condemnation after photos on social media showed him in an airport line, in a passenger lounge, aboard an airliner and leaving Cancun International Airport in Mexico.Some critics slammed his comments blaming his daughters, aged 10 and 12, for his decision to visit the resort, where the weather was a balmy 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius) on Thursday evening. The Texas Democratic Party called on him to resign.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki, speaking before Cruz was spotted at Cancun airport, said tongue-in-cheek: “I don’t have any updates on the exact location of Senator Ted Cruz, nor does anyone at the White House.”Millions of Texans remained paralyzed by power and water outages after a winter storm and freezing temperatures that hampered efforts to restore full power.Some 2.7 million Texas households were without heat on Wednesday and leaders warned of a domino effect on infrastructure as the lack of power cut off water supplies, strained the ability of hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients and isolated vulnerable communities cut off by frozen roads.“We need to be here, we need to be in the battle, we need to be helping Texans,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told MSNBC when asked about Cruz.Cruz, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, won re-election to the Senate in 2018 by eking out a victory over Democrat Beto O’Rourke by less than 3 percentage points. He is not due to run again until 2024.In December, Cruz criticized Austin, Texas, mayor Stephen Adler on Twitter for taking a trip to Mexico in December while telling others not to travel during the pandemic.",Reuters
1052,Harris taps growing political power of women lawmakers to promote U.S. COVID-19 relief,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-vice-president-women/harris-taps-growing-political-power-of-women-lawmakers-to-promote-u-s-covid-19-relief-idUSKBN2AI2Q4,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris met with female Democratic lawmakers and activists on Thursday to boost support for the White House’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, highlighting the growing political power of women in Congress.The virtual meeting, which a White House source said was likely the first of many that Harris will hold specifically with women in power, focused on how women have been affected by job losses, small business closures and a lack of childcare as well as how Biden's plan will address these issues. Nearly 400,000 childcare jobs have been lost since the outset of the pandemic, Harris said. (COVID-19 graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)The COVID-19 pandemic has had an outsized impact on women, who lost jobs at a higher rate than men and have struggled to return to the workforce because of the need to care for children unable to attend school.Specific carveouts in the COVID-19 relief bill are designed to address problems faced by women, including an investment of $40 billion in childcare, paid family leave for 100 million additional workers and an investment of $130 billion to help re-open K-12 schools safely.“For me this is personal.... The longer we wait to act, the harder it will be to bring these women back into the work force,” Harris told the group calling the situation where 2.5 million women have left the workforce a “national emergency.”That compares with 1.8 million men who have left the work force during the same period, according to Labor Department data.“In one year...the pandemic has put decades of the progress we have collectively made for women workers at risk,” she said.Harris said the package would “lift up nearly half of the children who are living in poverty in our country,” a claim backed by analysis by Columbia University.Attendees included House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, Representative Barbara Lee and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto.Harris has already been deeply involved in policy and diplomacy in the early weeks of President Joe Biden’s administration. Earlier she met with Black Chambers of Commerce and Black mayors at a meeting convened by the African American Mayors Association to talk about COVID-19 relief, and this week held a call with French President Emmanuel Macron.Harris’ meeting on Thursday occurred as Congress has more female members than ever before, with 27% of all seats, more than double the number in 2001. The vast majority of women lawmakers are Democrats, and a growing percentage of women have voted for Democrats in recent elections. Black women rallied behind Biden during critical turns in his 2020 presidential campaign.Murray said women are facing challenges with remote learning for children, so they must get them back into schools safely. “Women are leaving the work force because of this,” she said.The meeting also included Melanie Campbell of the Black Women’s Roundtable; Jen Earle, National Association of Women Business Owners; Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry and Tina Tchen, CEO of the anti-sexual harassment group Time’s UP.“Our economy cannot fully recover unless women can participate fully,” Harris said.",Reuters

CEO Tim Hoettges told reporters on Friday that Deutsche Telekom planned to put in a bid.Health Minister Jens Spahn wants the vaccination passports ready in 12 weeks as part of EU plans under which they would serve as proof that a holder is vaccinated or has recovered from the viral disease and thus have a degree of protection against the disease.The EU executive aims to present its plans for a “digital green pass” on March 17 and to cooperate with international organisations to ensure its system also works beyond the EU, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday.Deutsche Telekom, which is partly state owned, co-designed a German smartphone app that uses Bluetooth short-range radio chatter between devices to pinpoint and alert those at risk of catching COVID-19.The Corona Warn App, which has been downloaded nearly 26 million times, was created in partnership with SAP. The business software group said, however, that it was not part of the bid for the digital vaccination passport.U.S. software giant Microsoft declined to comment on reports that it was participating in the tender.Germany already uses passport-sized yellow booklets to keep an individual’s vaccination record.

1055,"From Clubhouse to Twitter Spaces, social media grapples with live audio moderation
The explosive growth of Clubhouse, an audio-based social network buoyed by appearances from tech celebrities like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, has drawn scrutiny over how the app will handle problematic content, from hate speech to harassment and misinformation.
MAR 01 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clubhouse-moderation-focus/from-clubhouse-to-twitter-spaces-social-media-grapples-with-live-audio-moderation-idUSKBN2AP1J2,"(Reuters) - The explosive growth of Clubhouse, an audio-based social network buoyed by appearances from tech celebrities like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, has drawn scrutiny over how the app will handle problematic content, from hate speech to harassment and misinformation.Moderating real-time discussion is a challenge for a crop of platforms using live voice chat, from video game-centric services like Discord to Twitter Inc’s new live-audio feature Spaces. Facebook is also reportedly dabbling with an offering.“Audio presents a fundamentally different set of challenges for moderation than text-based communication. It’s more ephemeral and it’s harder to research and action,” said Discord’s chief legal officer, Clint Smith, in an interview.Tools to detect problematic audio content lag behind those used to identify text, and transcribing and examining recorded voice chats is a more cumbersome process for people and machines. A lack of extra clues, like the visual signals of video or accompanying text comments, can also make it more challenging.“Most of what you have in terms of the tools of content moderation are really built around text,” said Daniel Kelley, associate director of the Anti-Defamation League’s Center for Technology and Society.Not all companies make or keep voice recordings to investigate reports of rule violations. While Twitter keeps Spaces audio for 30 days or longer if there is an incident, Clubhouse says it deletes its recording if a live session ends without an immediate user report, and Discord does not record at all.Instead, Discord, which has faced pressure to curb toxic content like harassment and white supremacist material in text and voice chats, gives users controls to mute or block people and relies on them to flag problematic audio.Such community models can be empowering for users but may be easily abused and subject to biases.Clubhouse, which has similarly introduced user controls, has drawn scrutiny over whether actions like blocking, which can prevent users from joining certain rooms, can be employed to harass or exclude users.The challenges of moderating live audio are set against the broader, global battle over content moderation on big social media platforms, which are criticized for their power and opacity, and have drawn complaints from both the right and left as either too restrictive or dangerously permissive.Online platforms have also long struggled with curbing harmful or graphic live content on their sites. In 2020, a live video of a suicide on Facebook Inc spread across multiple sites. In 2019, a shooting in a German synagogue was live-streamed on Amazon Inc-owned gaming site Twitch.“It’s really important for these services to be learning from the rollout of video-streaming to understand they will face all of the same kinds of questions,” said Emma Llansó, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy & Technology and a member of Twitch’s Safety Advisory Council. She added: “What happens when people want to use your service to livestream audio of an encounter with police or a violent attack?”‘UP TO INFINITY’Last Sunday, during the company’s public town hall, Clubhouse co-founder Paul Davison presented a vision for how the currently invite-only app would play a bigger role in people’s lives - hosting everything from political rallies to company all-hands meetings.Rooms, currently capped at 8,000 people, would scale “up to infinity” and participants could make money from “tips” paid by the audience.The San Francisco-based company’s latest round of financing in January valued it at $1 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. The funding was led by Andreessen Horowitz, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm.Asked how Clubhouse was working to detect dangerous content as the service expanded, Davison said the tiny startup has been staffing up its trust and safety team to handle issues in multiple languages and quickly investigate incidents.The app, which said it has 10 million weekly active users, has a full-time staff that only recently reached double digits. A spokeswoman said it uses both in-house reviewers and third-party services to moderate content and has engaged advisors on the issue, but would not comment on review or detection methods.In the year since it started, Clubhouse has faced criticism over reports of misogyny, anti-Semitism and COVID-19 misinformation on the platform despite rules against racism, hate speech, abuse and false information.Clubhouse has said it is investing in tools to detect and prevent abuse as well as features for users, who can set rules for their rooms, to moderate conversations.Getting audio content moderation right could help spark new waves of business and usage for new services and features launched by the major social networks.One source told Reuters that billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban’s upcoming live audio platform ‘Fireside,’ which describes itself as a “socially responsible platform,” would be curated to avoid the issues other networks have faced.Twitter, which has long faced criticism for its ability to curb abuse, is currently testing Spaces with 1,000 users that began with women and people from marginalized groups.Hosts are given controls to moderate and users can report problems. But Twitter is also looking at investing in “proactive detection” - for example, incorporating audio transcripts into tools Twitter currently uses to detect problem tweets without users flagging, said Andrew McDiarmid of Twitter’s product trust team.McDiarmid said Twitter was still deciding how to translate existing rules, like labeling misinformation, which also apply to the new service, to the audio arena.Until Twitter nails down its moderation plan, people who have recently violated the site’s rules are not allowed access to the new feature.",Reuters

The goal is to lower costs.Facebook has focused on developing software for the open networks while partnering with hardware companies to come up with designs for hardware. Marvell on Monday said it had partnered with Facebook on a circuit board design for what is known as a “distributed unit,” or DU, which sits near the bottom of a cell tower to crunch data coming in through the tower’s radio units.The design will be free for telecommunications firms to use, but contains multiple Marvell processors. The move is aimed at making it easier for telecommunications firms to get networks up and running because the design work is already done, while at the same time helping Marvell sell more chips.“What we are designing for Facebook is a system that anyone, in the fullness of time, can deploy,” Raj Singh, executive vice president of the processors business group at Marvell, said in an interview.",Reuters

1061,"As online grocery booms in Britain, will new habits die hard?
Britain's multi-billion pound supermarket industry is placing its bets on whether big-spending older shoppers will stick with buying their groceries online when months of lockdown end.
MAR 01 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-onlinegroc/as-online-grocery-booms-in-britain-will-new-habits-die-hard-idUSKCN2AT1JT,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s multi-billion pound supermarket industry is placing its bets on whether big-spending older shoppers will stick with buying their groceries online when months of lockdown end.Having more than doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic to represent 16% of Britain’s roughly 200 billion pound ($281 billion) food retail market, the country has one of the world’s highest take-ups of online grocery.Ocado boss Tim Steiner says it’s here to stay and will carry on growing quickly.Not so fast, say bosses of some established rivals.“A lot of people are talking about the new normal, I’m absolutely convinced that we are not in this new normal right now, we are in the temporary normal, we are in an extraordinary time,” Christian Härtnagel, CEO of Lidl GB, told Reuters.He believes that as the crisis recedes, so will online grocery penetration, not back to pre-COVID-19 levels of 7% but a lot less than 16%.Lidl does not offer home delivery and for many the jury is out on whether online sales can ever be as profitable as instore purchasing, where shoppers make more impulse buys and extra transport and logistic costs are avoided.Older shoppers have led the rapid growth of Britain’s online sector.A third national lockdown boosted retired households’ online grocery spending in January by 229% year-on-year, making up 28% of the 6.4 million who ordered online in the month, market researcher Kantar found.Whether they stick with it after restrictions end, possibly in June, remains to be seen. The rollout of vaccine will make people less risk averse and months of isolation have left many eager for the social contact of a visit to the shops.Stephen Pfeffer, a 75-year old retired bank worker from South Woodford in east London, was classified as a vulnerable person at the start of the pandemic so for much of 2020, he took online deliveries from Waitrose.“I was forced into online shopping with the first lockdown,” he said.But after regaining his confidence to venture out, he returned to shopping at stores. Now, he has been vaccinated, he uses online only occasionally for bulky items like wine.“I thought, you can’t isolate all the time - let’s get out there and start living again,” he said.Ocado’s Steiner told Reuters that once customers have experienced the ease of online shopping, they are likely to be converted and he expected online grocery in Britain would double in size again over the next few years.“When customers have done this three-to-five times they tend to stick with it,” he said last month.He said similar trends were evident in France, Japan, Sweden and the United States - countries where Ocado has won partnership deals.Steiner co-founded Ocado in 2000 and has seen its stock market value double over the last year to about 17 billion pounds, much of that based on its potential for further overseas deals.However, sceptics say traditional supermarket groups in Britain struggle to match online profits with those generated by in-store shopping.“They’ll tell you they make money out of online,” Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said.“Whether they do or they don’t, they make less money than if I go to the supermarket.”He said the big chains have the ability to curb demand by restricting delivery slots and raising delivery charges once social distancing rules are relaxed and they can get more shoppers in their stores.In any case, some in the industry say it would be wrong to see the shift to online grocery shopping as being as decisive as for newspapers and video and music streaming.“Anyone who’s saying this is a permanent change in the grocery sector, there’s no evidence to back that up,” said one executive of a major British grocer who declined to be named.Much will depend on the investment strategies of Britain’s major supermarket groups - market leader Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons - as well as Amazon, which has a less than 1% share of the UK grocery market.Some critics draw parallels with the space race of the nineties and first decade of this century, when Tesco and Asda in particular built ever bigger superstores.That fizzled out as shoppers fell out of love with massive out-of-town stores and supermarkets realised they could not make much profit from selling large items, such as furniture.Some say it is symptomatic of people’s attachment to stores that the supermarkets’ heavy investment in digital capacity had led to only a small proportion of shoppers opting for online purchases until the pandemic struck.For the big four supermarkets, increased take-up has improved the economics of online, but it still dilutes profits.Kantar’s McKevitt said he expected online grocery demand to taper, at least in the short term.The supermarket groups are in a quandary, he said.“They’re between the devil and the deep blue sea,” he said.“They don’t want to lose out on market share that will go to rivals if they don’t offer enough online slots or at the right price, but, on the other hand, they would probably rather that people went to their shops.”($1 = 0.7129 pounds)",Reuters

Too many Americans were left waiting weeks for important deliveries of mail and packages,” DeJoy said last week, apologizing to customers.Last week, USPS reported $318 million of income for the quarter ended Dec. 31, delivering a record 1.1 billion holiday season packages, while first-class mail revenue decreased by $177 million.USPS reported net losses totaling $86.7 billion from 2007 through 2020. One reason is Congress in 2006 passed legislation requiring USPS to pre-fund more than $120 billion in retiree health care and pension liabilities.

1065,Texas ranchers scramble to keep animals alive in unusual cold,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-weather-cattle/texas-ranchers-scramble-to-keep-animals-alive-in-unusual-cold-idUSKBN2AI1K3,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Texas ranchers worked overtime to haul water and hay to cattle to keep them alive during a freak winter storm, but some cows have already succumbed to unusual icy temperatures that also killed chickens, idled meat plants and threatened crops.The deaths of baby cows in the top U.S. cattle state and struggles to care for surviving livestock are the latest challenges for ranchers who over the past year have dealt with COVID-19 cutting demand for meat at restaurants and shuttering slaughterhouses.In Texas, home to more than 13 million cattle, ranchers said they are spending long, cold hours breaking up ice in water tanks and on frozen ponds so animals have something to drink. Icy conditions have turned diesel fuel into a useless gel in tractors. Ranchers said they are using gasoline-powered pickup trucks to transport hay that cattle can eat and use for warm bedding.Kaylin Isbell, a rancher in Florence, Texas, said a few cows and sheep had died after birth. Babies are particularly vulnerable to the shock of the cold when they leave their mothers’ warm wombs covered in fluid. Isbell said her mother-in-law took newly born sheep into a spare bedroom in her home to keep them warm.The cold will also kill oats Isbell planted for young cattle to graze on, she said. As a result, Isbell said she will need to sell the animals earlier than expected, reducing her profit margins.Ranchers nationwide were already facing higher feed costs as corn and soybean prices soared to multi-year highs.“We just keep going,” Isbell said. “That’s all you can do.”Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told Reuters that baby chicks are freezing to death because there is not enough natural gas to heat hatcheries. He said dairy operations are dumping $8 million worth of milk down the drains daily because milk processing plants are without power. Grain mills across the state cannot manufacture animal feed without power either, Miller said.“We’ve got an animal welfare issue going on,” he said.Major meat processors like Cargill Inc and Tyson Foods Inc said they suspended operations at some plants.In Whitesboro, Texas, fifth-generation rancher Austin Miles said he is filling a red 300-gallon tank with water from a hose at his parents’ home two to three times a day and shuttling it to cattle to drink. The pond they would normally drink from froze, he said.“This is extreme for us,” Miles said. “Our infrastructure was just not quite set up for these prolonged cold periods.”The storm has killed at least 21 people across four states, and temperatures are forecast to remain 20 to 35 degrees below average across parts of the central and southern United States for days.Cattle could suffer from respiratory problems once the deep freeze gives way to warmer temperatures, said Missy Bonds, assistant general manager of her family’s ranch in Saginaw, Texas.“Mother Nature needs a Xanax,” she said.",Reuters

To read the special report click reut.rs/2OCOT2W“We were already aware of Amazon’s thought process and strategy,” the All India Mobile Retailers Association (AIMRA) wrote in the letter. The documents, the letter said, “have revealed that Amazon is doing business in India with the strategy of deftly dodging the regulators and politicians”.AIMRA urged the government to “suspend all Amazon activities in India” until there is an investigation into the company’s practices.Amazon says it doesn’t give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace and has always complied with Indian law.Amazon and Modi’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Indian retailers, a crucial part of Modi’s support base, have long alleged that Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart flout federal regulations and that their business practices hurt small traders. The companies, which run the two biggest e-commerce platforms in India, deny the allegations.The Amazon documents reviewed by Reuters showed the company helped a small number of sellers prosper on its website, discounted their fees and helped one cut special deals with big tech manufacturers such as Apple Inc.Some 35 of Amazon’s more than 400,000 sellers in India in early 2019 accounted for around two-thirds of its online sales, the documents also showed.AIMRA said in its letter the government should cap a single seller’s daily smartphone sales on Amazon and Flipkart at 500,000 rupees ($6,829).The group also alleges the U.S. firms promoted sales on their platforms through preferred sellers, asking the government to investigate tie-ups between smartphone brands and these sellers.Flipkart did not respond to a request for comment. In the special report published last month, Amazon said in a statement that it was helping small businesses in India and that it “treats all sellers in a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner”.Brick-and-mortar retailers have said they’re struggling to compete with the tech giants as online smartphone sales boom.

Bitcoin's 300% price surge since October has revived China's grey market in cryptocurrency trading, putting regulators on alert over financial risks and capital outflows as volatility spikes.

Once-dormant Chinese trading chatrooms on social media have become busier.“I’ve come to look for investment opportunities,” said Paris Chang, who opened an account last month at cryptocurrency exchange Binance.Brushing aside worries over the volatility and the recent sell-off, he said: “This market is for the big hearts.”China-focused cryptocurrency exchanges are not licensed on the mainland, but individuals can easily open accounts and trade online if they upload details of their Chinese identity cards.Exchanges such as Binance and MXC bar the use of yuan and only allow trading between cryptocurrency pairs, such as bitcoin versus the dollar-linked stablecoin tether (USDT).But Chinese investors can use peer-to-peer markets to buy USDT using yuan, with payment made via bank cards or online transfers. This process does not violate Chinese laws.But Chinese individuals appear to be moving capital overseas under official quotas to obtain their USDT, under the guise of making medical or other legitimate purchases, a regulatory source told Reuters. The loophole allows investors to get around China’s strict capital controls.China’s securities market watchdog told its regional bureaux last week to adopt tighter oversight of cryptocurrency trading, said the source, who has direct knowledge of the matter but is not authorised to speak to the media.He added that overseas-registered exchanges are outside Beijing’s remit.The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Huang Mengqi, a lawyer at Beijing DHH Law Firm, said regulators’ inability to govern offshore cryptocurrency exchanges could blind them to potential risks.“You cannot stop people from trading bitcoin, because Chinese law recognises the value of virtual assets. Anything with value should be allowed to change hands,” Huang said.The absence of data and investor information on those exchanges, however, complicates China’s anti-money laundering efforts and blunts the effectiveness of capital controls, the lawyer said.In 2020, $17.5 billion worth of digital assets flowed out of Chinese exchanges to foreign venues, 53% more than in the previous year, suggesting a rise in capital flight out of China, consultancy PeckShield said in its anti-money laundering report.Changhao Jiang, co-founder and CTO of Cobo, a Chinese cryptocurrency custodian and digital wallet provider, saw a jump in business this year.“China remains a very big market for cryptocurrencies,” said Jiang, whose firm’s mission is to “make it easy to own and use cryptocurrencies.”",Reuters

Inner Mongolia is an attractive “mining” spot alongside Sichuan and Xinjiang due to low electricity prices.Small firms with outdated technology in the steel, ferroalloy, coke, graphite electrode and coal-fired power sectors have also been given a timetable to close by the end of 2022.“(Inner Mongolia) will tighten its energy control measures and bear the targets throughout all economic and social aspects,” said the draft rule, adding it will strictly curb blind expansion at firms which consume a lot of energy.Local governments in China are scrambling to control energy consumption and improve energy efficiency after President Xi Jinping pledged to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.In 2016-2019, energy intensity in Inner Mongolia rose by 9.5% while overall energy consumption grew by 65.62 million tonnes.The region has also vowed to increase the share of renewable energy in its power portfolio, aiming to install more than 100 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity by 2025.China appears to have missed its target for cutting energy intensity set for 2016-2020, according to Reuters calculation based on official data.",Reuters

With the highest food waste per capita in Asia, the Japanese government has enacted a new law to halve such costs from 2000 levels by 2030, pushing companies to find solutions.Convenience store chain Lawson Inc has started using AI from U.S. firm DataRobot, which estimates how much product on shelves, from onigiri rice balls to egg and tuna sandwiches, may go unsold or fall short of demand.Lawson aims to bring down overstock by 30% in places where it has been rolled out, and wants to halve food waste at all of its stores in 2030 compared with 2018.Disposal of food waste is the biggest cost for Lawson’s franchise owners after labour costs.Drinks maker Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd is experimenting with another AI product from Fujitsu Ltd to try to determine if goods such as bottles of oolong tea and mineral water have been damaged in shipping.Until now, that’s been a time-consuming human endeavour. With the new AI, Suntory hopes to gauge when a damaged box is just that, or when the contents themselves have been damaged and need to be returned.Suntory aims to reduce the return of goods by 30-50% and cut the cost of food waste and develop a common standard system that can be shared by other food makers and shipping firms.Japan’s notoriously fussy shoppers are showing signs of getting on board, especially as the coronavirus pandemic hits incomes.Tatsuya Sekito launched Kuradashi, an e-commerce firm dealing in unsold foods at a discount, in 2014 after seeing massive amounts of waste from food processors while working for a Japanese trading firm in China.The online business is now thriving due partly to a jump in demand for low-priced unsold foods as consumers became more cost conscious amid the COVID-19 pandemic.“Sales grew 2.5 times last year from a year before, while the amount of food waste has doubled since the coronavirus cut off food supply chain,” Sekito told Reuters.Kuradashi has a network of 800 companies, including Meiji Holdings Co, Kagome Co and Lotte Foods Co, who sell it a total 50,000 items including packs of instant curry, smoothies and high-quality nori.“Japanese shoppers tend to be picky but we attract customers by offering not just a sale but a chance to donate a portion of purchases to a charity, raising awareness about social issues,” Sekito said.Membership numbers jumped to 180,000 in 2021 from 80,000 in 2019.Others have also joined forces with food firms in developing new technological platform to cut food waste as part of global efforts to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs).NEC Corp is using AI that can not only analyse data such as weather, calendar and customers’ trends in estimating demand but also give reasoning behind its analysis.NEC has deployed the technology to some major retailers and food makers, helping them reduce costs by 15%-75%.NEC hopes to share and process data through a common platform among makers, retailers and logistics, to reduce mismatches in supply chains.“Reducing food waste is not our ultimate goal,” said Ryoichi Morita, senior manager overseeing NEC’s digital integration.“Eventually, we hope it can lead to resolve other business challenges such as minimizing costs, fixing labour shortages, streamlining inventory, orders and logistics.”",Reuters

Former President Donald Trump’s administration made a last-minute push to accelerate energy development on public lands, including by amending the so-called Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan just days before leaving office.In the coming days, Biden’s Department of Interior will revoke the public comment period on those plan amendments, a spokesman for the agency said in an emailed statement.Biden supports building more renewable energy installations on public lands, but his administration said the original DRECP balanced wind and solar development with conservation and outdoor recreation.“The Trump administration’s proposal in its final days to re-open the plan is unnecessary and at odds with balanced land management,” Laura Daniel Davis, Interior’s principal deputy secretary for land and minerals management, said in a statement.The DRECP was hatched jointly with the state of California during the presidency of Barack Obama and set aside areas for renewable energy development. Last month, Trump’s Interior said the changes were needed for California to meet its goal to phase out the use of fossil fuels.Some wind and solar developers opposed the Obama-era strategy because they said it left millions of acres off-limits to their projects.This month, the California Wind Energy Association sent a letter to Interior saying that the DRECP amendments proposed by the previous administration “may be consistent with the Administration’s climate policy goals and urge that it be considered.”An Interior official would not comment on the letter.",Reuters

Any federal reparations program could cost trillions of dollars, they estimate.Supporters say such payments would act as acknowledgement of the value of the forced, unpaid labor that supported the economy of Southern U.S. states until the Civil War ended slavery in 1865, the broken promise of land grants after the war and the burden of the century and a half of legal and de facto segregation that followed.",Reuters

Such online manga platforms have seen a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic.Piccoma’s third-quarter transaction volumes more than tripled year on year to 11.6 billion yen ($110 million), extending a wave of online manga sales that has already seen digital surpass print in Japan’s $5 billion manga industry.Line Manga, now operated by SoftBank’s internet business Z Holdings, saw transaction volumes jump by a third to 8.2 billion yen in the same period. Naver declined an interview request.Piccoma passed Line Manga to become last year’s top-grossing manga app on both Apple’s IoS and Android. Its rise can be traced back to 2016, when it introduced a revenue model it calls “zero yen if you wait.”The app’s manga tales - from classroom love stories to supernatural horror - are serialized. Users must wait for a timer to unlock the next instalment, or pay to read ahead.Inspired by smartphone games in which playing is free but extra content is not, the approach marked a radical departure from the typical model of selling an entire manga volume up front at prices of $4-$6.“We thought if we could grab 5% or 10% of the bigger games market it would drive growth,” said Yukiko Sugiyama, senior manager in Kakao Japan’s business strategy department.Readers, eager to find out what happens next, often end up paying. The business model has become standard as dozens of book sellers, tech companies and publishers rushed to offer their own apps.Megumi, a 34-year-old office worker in western Japan, said she reads 20 pages or so of manga on her phone during her lunch break, and turned to the two apps when stuck at home taking care of kids during last year’s pandemic state of emergency.She became “addicted” to and paid for a hit Line Manga series, “True Beauty”, about a young woman whose makeup skills make her popular with men.The strip originated in Korea, where the rise of the internet saw paper sales collapse, replaced by smartphone-optimised comics.Manga apps offer a vast back catalogue of titles and exclusive strips.“You can read manga carrying just your smartphone - it’s handy,” said Kana Misaki, a 36-year-old care worker living near Tokyo who reads manga “overwhelmingly” via apps.In Japan, online manga is generally still formatted like a book, and traditional publishers are a powerful force, with editors closely involved in each stage of production.Printed in black and white on cheap paper, paper manga remains affordable and disposable. The industry is protected under Japanese law from books being sold for less than their cover price, even online.“For new titles, paper sales are much higher,” said Shu Hashimoto, an editor at publisher Kodansha’s long-running Weekly Shonen Magazine.Even the most ardent app users say they will buy paper editions of their favourite titles.“You don’t know when titles will disappear from the apps, so when I want them close at hand I buy them,” Misaki said.($1 = 103.6900 yen)",Reuters

Manga artist Kamentotsu didn't expect much when he uploaded a four-panel strip about an anthropomorphic bear who runs a cake shop to his Twitter account three years ago.

Within a week, 40 companies had approached him with offers.“Publishing company editors have gone from bringing up manga artists, like they are farming, to hunting for them,” said Kamentotsu, who goes by his pen name and wears a mask in media appearances.By searching for talent online, publishers squeezed by the rise of the internet can see an artist’s audience potential out in the open.For Japan’s striving manga artists, many of whom toil in obscurity for low pay, that means going viral can be life changing.Kamentotsu’s strip, which is published by Shogakukan, has gone on to sell more than half a million books. The titular bear, who wears a chef’s hat, has become a popular soft toy and its image was used to promote frozen dumplings.Japanese pop culture is piled with such cute, memorable characters.Industry observers say that a feel-good style - known as the “iyashikei” or “soothing” genre in Japanese - is particularly fitting online audiences.But other recent hits are quite a bit darker, such as “Jujutsu Kaisen” and “Demon Slayer”.Kousuke Oono’s “The Way of the Househusband” has a high concept idea: a feared yakuza gangster - tattooed, clad all in black but wearing an apron - quits crime to take care of the home while his wife works.“A comedic story with easy-to-understand characters and title is suited to the internet... we thought about that from the planning stage,” said Arimasa Nishikawa, an editor at manga site Kurage Bunch, which first published the strip.“Househusband”, popular on manga apps and in print, plays with gender stereotypes at a time of social change in Japan. A line of aprons has been a hit with fans.The strip has been made into a TV drama, with an animated version set to stream on Netflix this year.",Reuters

The weekly rocket ride higher came despite a broader market selloff that sent the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX down 2.5% over the same time. Analysts have struggled to find a clear explanation, and some were skeptical the rally would have legs.“You might be able to make some quick trading money and it could be a lot of money, but in the end, it’s the greater fool theory,” said Eric Diton, president and managing director at The Wealth Alliance in New York. The theory refers to buying stocks that are over-valued, anticipating a “greater fool” will buy them later at a higher price.Analysts mostly ruled out a short squeeze like the one that fueled GameStop’s rally in January, when individual investors using Robinhood and other apps punished hedge funds that had bet against the stock, forcing them to unwind short positions. Many GameStop buyers took their cues from online investment forums on Reddit and elsewhere.Short interest accounted for 28.4% of the float on Thursday, compared with a peak of 142% in early January, according to S3 Partners.Options market activity in GameStop, which has returned to the top of the list in a social media-driven retail trading frenzy, suggested investors were betting on higher prices, higher volatility, or both.Refinitiv data showed retail investors have been buying deep out-of-the-money call options, which have contract prices to buy far higher than the current stock price.Many of those option contracts were set to expire on Friday, meaning handsome gains for those who bet on a further rise in GameStop’s stock price.Call options, profitable for holders if GameStop shares hit $200 and $800 this week, have been particularly heavily traded, the data showed. GameStop’s stock traded this week as high as $184.54 on Thursday, far below the $483 intraday high it hit in January.“The actors are looking to take advantage of everything they can to maximize their impact and the timing is important,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer of investment research firm New Constructs. “The options expiration will contribute to their strategy on how to push the stock as much as they can and maximize their profits.”Bots on major social media websites have been hyping GameStop and other “meme stocks,” although the extent to which they influenced prices was unclear, according to analysis by Massachusetts-based cyber security company PiiQ Media. [nL1N2KW2TW]The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday suspended trading in 15 companies because of “questionable trading and social media activity.” GameStop was not among them.The 15 companies were in addition to six stocks it recently suspended due to suspicious social media activity.Robinhood said it has received inquiries from regulators about temporary trading curbs it imposed during a wild rally in shorted stocks earlier this year.Other Reddit favorites were also lower on Friday, with cinema operator AMC Entertainment down 3.4%, headphone maker Koss off 22.4% and marijuana company Sundial Growers down 2.9%.",Reuters
1093,"Analysis: How idled car factories super-charged a push for U.S. chip subsidies
When President Joe Biden on Wednesday stood at a lectern holding a microchip and pledged to support $37 billion in federal subsidies for American semiconductor manufacturing, it marked a political breakthrough that happened much more quickly than industry insiders had expected.
FEB 26 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-analysis/analysis-how-idled-car-factories-super-charged-a-push-for-u-s-chip-subsidies-idUSKBN2AQ30D,"(Reuters) - When President Joe Biden on Wednesday stood at a lectern holding a microchip and pledged to support $37 billion in federal subsidies for American semiconductor manufacturing, it marked a political breakthrough that happened much more quickly than industry insiders had expected.For years, chip industry executives and U.S. government officials have been concerned about the slow drift of costly chip factories to Taiwan and Korea. While major American companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp dominate their fields, they depend on factories abroad to build the chips they design.As tensions with China heated up last year, U.S. lawmakers authorized manufacturing subsidies as part of an annual military spending bill due to concerns that depending on foreign factories for advanced chips posed national security risks. Yet funding for the subsidies was not guaranteed.Then came the auto-chip crunch. Ford Motor Co said a lack of chips could slash a fifth of its first-quarter production and General Motors Co cut output across North America.“It brings home very clearly the message that the semiconductor is really a critical component in a lot of the end products we take for granted,” said Mike Rosa, head of strategic and technical marketing for a group within semiconductor manufacturing toolmaker Applied Materials Inc that sells tools to automotive chip factories.Within weeks, automakers joined chip companies calling for chip factory subsidies, and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and President Biden both pledged to fight for funding.Industry backers now aim to be part of a package of legislation to counter China that Schumer hopes to bring to the Senate floor this spring. Still, all agree it will do little to solve the immediate auto-chip problem.Headlines about idled car plants resonated with the public that had shrugged off abstract warnings in the past, said Jim Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Lawmakers, already worried that a promised infrastructure bill will not materialize this year, decided to push for quick solution.“Nobody wants to be seen as soft on China. No one wants to tell the Ford workers in their district, ‘Sorry, can’t help,’” Lewis said. “It was one of those moments where everything aligned.”The package includes matching funds for state and local chip-plant subsidies, a provision likely to heat up competition among states including Texas and Arizona to host big new chip plants that can cost as much as $20 billion.The subsidies could benefit a factory in Arizona proposed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and one in Texas eyed by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, even though those factories would be geared toward high-end chips for smartphones and laptops, rather than simpler auto chips. And those factories would not come on line until 2023 or 2024, according to plans disclosed by the companies, the world’s two largest chip manufacturers.In the longer term, a raft of U.S. companies are also poised to benefit. Any chipmakers that build factories will source many tools from American companies such as Applied, Lam Research Corp and KLA Corp.Intel Corp, Micron Technology Inc and GlobalFoundries - which already have U.S. factory networks - will also likely benefit.Smaller, specialty chip factories also could benefit.“The recent chip shortage in the automotive industry has highlighted the need to strengthen the microelectronics supply chain in the U.S.,” said Thomas Sonderman, chief executive of SkyWater Technology, a Minnesota-based chipmaker that makes automotive and defense chips. “We believe that SkyWater is uniquely positioned due to our differentiated business model and status as a U.S.- owned and U.S.- operated pure play semiconductor contract manufacturer.”Even with subsidies, the U.S. companies still must compete with low-cost Asian vendors over the long run, and the immediate auto chip troubles will probably persist.Surya Iyer, a vice president at Minnesota-based Polar Semiconductor, which makes chips for automakers, said his factory is booked beyond capacity and has started to speed some orders up while slowing others down, to meet automakers’ needs as best it can.“We are expecting this level of demand to continue at least for the next 12 months, maybe even longer,” he said.(This story adds attribution to quote in paragraph 9, adds dropped words in paragraphs 10 and 17)",Reuters

Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman told Congress this month that bots, artificial or fake accounts with automated content, had not played a “significant role” in GameStop Reddit message traffic.PiiQ Media’s analysis of Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc, Instagram and YouTube posts, however, found that bots used the platforms to push GameStop and other “meme” stocks, although it is unclear how influential they were in the overall saga.A startup that focuses on social media risks, PiiQ said it examined patterns of keywords such as “Hold the Line” and GameStop’s stock symbol, “GME,” across conversations and profiles prior to the Jan. 28 frenzy, through Feb. 18. For comparison, it also assessed posts on an unrelated set of stocks.PiiQ said it identified very similar daily “start and stop patterns” in the GameStop-related posts, with activity starting at the beginning of the trading day, followed by a large spike at the end of the trading day. Such patterns are indicative of bots, said Aaron Barr, co-founder and chief technology officer of PiiQ.“We saw clear patterns of artificial behavior across the other four social media platforms. When you think of organic content, it’s variable in the day, variable day-to-day. It doesn’t have the exact same pattern every day for a month,” he said.Based on its authenticity scoring system, PiiQ estimates there are tens of thousands of bot accounts hyping GameStop, the meme stocks, and Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency swept up in the frenzy. Thousands of fake accounts can be purchased for as little as $200, it said.The company did not analyze Reddit data, but Barr said he would expect to see a similar pattern of activity on Reddit, indicating bot-like or coordinated management of conversations.A representative for Reddit did not comment beyond Huffman’s testimony. Representatives for YouTube, Facebook and its Instagram subsidiary did not respond to requests for comment. The social media platforms generally try to weed out harmful bots, said Barr.A representative of Twitter said “bots” had become a catch-all term that can often mischaracterize the nature of the account. The company notes bots can be used on its platform for creative or innovative purposes.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is probing the GameStop saga and on Friday suspended trading in 15 companies due to unusual trading activity and apparent attempts on social media to artificially inflate their stock prices. That is in addition to six stocks it recently suspended due to suspicious social media activity.“We proactively monitor for suspicious trading activity tied to stock promotions on social media, and act quickly to stop that trading,” the SEC’s acting enforcement director, Melissa Hodgman, said in a statement on Friday.In addition to traders, organized criminals may use social media to stoke asset prices, and undermining the integrity of U.S. markets is a known goal of hostile state actors, said Barr. But it is unclear how successful, if at all, these types of influence efforts are, he said.“Measuring the effect of those campaigns is often illusive.”",Reuters

Lawmakers have also urged the White House to pressure chip manufacturers to boost auto chip supply.Biden said on Wednesday he would seek $37 billion in funding for legislation to supercharge U.S. chip manufacturing and signed an executive order aimed at addressing the global semiconductor chip shortage.Automakers hit by the shortage include General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Stellantis and Subaru Corp.Ford said a lack of chips could cut production by up to 20% in the first quarter and lower the company’s adjusted earnings by $1 billion to $2.5 billion.GM said the shortage could shave up to $2 billion from 2021 profit as it has been forced to cut output at factories in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Mexico.A shortage of auto semiconductor chips could impact nearly 1 million units of global light vehicle production in the first quarter, data firm IHS Markit said.",Reuters

We must avoid such nuclear options being taken again,” Dowden said in a statement.Facebook said in a statement that the call had been constructive, and that it had already struck commercial deals with most major publishers in Britain.“Nick strongly agreed with the Secretary of State’s (Dowden’s) assertion that the government’s general preference is for companies to enter freely into proper commercial relationships with each other,” a Facebook spokesman said.Britain will host a meeting of G7 leaders in June.It is seeking to build consensus there for coordinated action toward “promoting competitive, innovative digital markets while protecting the free speech and journalism that underpin our democracy and precious liberties,” Dowden said.The G7 comprises the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Canada, but Australia has also been invited.Britain is working on a new competition regime aimed at giving consumers more control over their data, and introducing legislation that could regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of illegal or extremist content and bullying.",Reuters

The European Commission last year opened a formal investigation into the iPhone maker over some of the same practices.In letters to developers involved in the investigation sent earlier this month, which were described to Reuters by two people who received them, the regulator said it was nearing a draft decision in the case.It gave no indication of how it would rule.An ACM spokesman confirmed that the Apple investigation remains open but said the regulator could not comment on its progress.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.According to the confidential letter to developers, the regulator is also scrutinizing Apple rules that bar developers from telling users about cheaper payment alternatives outside of the app.“It’s not just that Apple is inflicting economic harm,” said David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founder of software firm Basecamp and one of those who received the letter, said of those rules. “Apple is essentially giving us a gag order.”Basecamp and another developer, Match Group, filed enforcement requests with the Dutch regulator after the investigation was underway.",Reuters
1100,"Britain to offer fast-track visas to bolster fintechs after Brexit
Britain said on Friday it would offer a fast-track visa scheme for jobs at high-growth companies after a government-backed review warned that financial technology firms will struggle with Brexit and tougher competition for global talent.

1101,"Brazil regulator approves 5G spectrum auction rules, no Huawei ban
Brazil's telecoms regulator Anatel has approved rules for a spectrum auction for fifth-generation networks this year without any curbs on China's Huawei Technologies Co as an equipment supplier.
FEB 26 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-telecoms/brazil-regulator-approves-5g-spectrum-auction-rules-no-huawei-ban-idUSKBN2AQ033,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s telecoms regulator Anatel has approved rules for a spectrum auction for fifth-generation networks this year without any curbs on China’s Huawei Technologies Co as an equipment supplier.Telecom companies will also be required to build stand-alone networks with the latest versions of 5G technology to be operating in state capital cities by July 30 next year, which will involve heavier investments that they had wanted.Right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro last year criticized the Chinese company and was under pressure from the Trump Administration to ban Huawei from the country’s fifth-generation technology market on security concerns.Brazil’s telecom companies insisted on a free market, complaining that excluding Huawei would cost billions of dollars to replace the Chinese company’s equipment that supplies 50% of the current 3G and 4G networks.Rules for the auction expected in June require telecoms to provide broadband connectivity across the vast Amazon region, largely using optic fiber cables laid in rivers, as well as in northeastern Brazil. They also must cover all federal highways.“Anatel found a good balance between obligations for the companies and the collection of operating rights payments,” said Andre Gildin, a telecoms expert at RKKG Consulting.He said companies that have already built up infrastructure based on existing 4G technology, such as Telefonica Brasil SA and Claro, owned by Mexico’s America Movil, will have higher capital expenditure outlays because they have to change the core of their networks.The third of the major cellphone companies, TIM Participações SA, which is controlled by Telecom Italia SpA, had not advanced so far into updated technology and favored the stand-alone rule, Gildin said.Anatel President Leonardo de Morais estimated the spectrum auction will generate 80 billion reais ($14.3 billion) in investments over the next 20 years. The telecoms would need about 7.6 billion reais in investments, including building a secure network for the federal government, which is expected to exclude equipment from Huawei.Industry representatives said Huawei, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment maker, could not be excluded from Brazil’s 5G market because, aside from the cost, it would set the country back three to four years in technology.Telefonica Brasil and Claro had been pressing for a 5-year transition to migrate to the more advanced stand-alone networks.The auction rules must be approved by Brazil’s Federal Audit Court, where the telecoms hope the government’s onerous conditions can be changed.",Reuters

Even those opposed to the conviction, like Senate Minority Leader (Mitch) McConnell, believe Donald Trump was guilty of a ‘disgraceful dereliction of duty’ and ‘practically and morally responsible for provoking’ the violence unleashed on the Capitol,” Biden said.He said he was thinking about Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was killed during the siege of the Capitol on Jan. 6, others who bravely stood guard, and those who lost their lives.He lauded the courage of those who made efforts to protect the integrity of U.S. democracy, including Democrats and Republicans, election officials and judges, elected representatives and poll workers.“This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile. That it must always be defended. That we must be ever vigilant. That violence and extremism has no place in America.

The tally fell short of the two-thirds needed to secure conviction.North Carolina Republican Chairman Michael Whatley condemned Burr for voting against the former president, as a “shocking and disappointing” abdication of his duty to voters.Burr, who said last week there was “compelling” evidence that President Trump was guilty of inciting an insurrection, said after the committee vote that it was a “sad day” for North Carolina Republicans.“My party’s leadership has chosen loyalty to one man over the core principles of the Republican Party and the founders of our great nation,” he said.Louisiana’s Republican Party voted on Saturday to censure Senator Bill Cassidy for voting to convict Trump. The party’s leader in Pennsylvania, Lawrence Tabas, has publicly criticized Senator Pat Toomey for voting to convict.The other four Republicans who voted to convict were Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse.The Republican Party faces internal conflict since Trump left office on Jan. 20, with many officials remaining publicly loyal to Trump and his devoted base of voters, while others including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have publicly criticized the former president.McConnell said in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Monday there was no question Trump “bears moral responsibility. His supporters stormed the Capitol because of the unhinged falsehoods he shouted into the world’s largest megaphone. His behavior during and after the chaos was also unconscionable.”",Reuters

Biden will deliver remarks at a virtual gathering of the Munich security forum here on Feb. 19.After years of Trump’s public ridiculing of NATO allies such as Germany who failed to reach defense spending targets, Biden’s Pentagon will, without abandoning those targets, focus on progress made toward bolstering NATO’s collective defense, officials said.“Trust is something that can’t be built overnight, is something that takes time. It takes more than words. It takes action,” said a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration’s objectives for the NATO meeting.To underscore Biden's views on NATO, the White House even took the rare step of releasing a video youtu.be/o9E1S3UPRFY on Jan. 27 of the U.S. president's first conversation with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in which he used the word ""sacred"" to describe the U.S. commitment to collective defense.Still, Biden could face an uphill battle in Europe, which saw Washington upend its commitments under Trump, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.Trump’s portrayal of NATO as an organization in crisis, dragged down by laggard members, has left many European allies feeling worn down.“There’s an exhaustion in European security circles from Trump and his unpredictability,” said a European NATO diplomat.“We’ve just spent four years not talking to each other and the world is very different from four years ago. Biden needs to do a big repair job in Europe.”Portugal’s Defence Minister Joao Gomes Cravinho, underscoring wariness about the United States, told the European Parliament on Jan. 28 that the Trump years were an “ideological experiment” that had “devastating effects in terms of the credibility of the United States and its strength internationally.”The deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in which pro-Trump followers tried to keep him in power, has also done severe damage to America’s global image as a beacon of democracy, political analysts said.One of Biden’s biggest challenges will be convincing allies there won’t be a return to another Trump era, or something akin to it, perhaps four or eight years down the line.“That’s a legitimate fear and a legitimate concern,” said Rachel Rizzo, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security focusing on European security and NATO.She added it will be a “slow process” to prove the United States can be a reliable ally.French President Emmanuel Macron has gone so far as to say Europe needs its own sovereign defense strategy, independent of the United States here. Still, eastern European allies such as Poland – fearful of Russia - say European defense plans should only complement NATO, not replace it.The NATO defense ministerial is expected to broach a range of issues, including efforts to end the two-decade-old war in Afghanistan.The ministerial is also expected to include discussion of the so-called “2 percent target” which requires NATO members spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024.Germany, Italy and Spain will all miss the 2024 target, according to initial projections released by NATO in October. Germany has pledged to reach the NATO spending target by 2031, and its failure angered Trump, who ordered a pullout of some 12,000 troops from Germany, declaring: “We don’t want to be the suckers any more.”Asked about the target, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said he expected Austin to emphasize that many allies were meeting the target and others were “striving to get there.”“I think you’ll see a supportive message from the secretary about how relevant NATO is,” said Kirby, a retired Navy admiral.Another U.S. official said that even with economic stress on budgets because of COVID-19, the expectation was still for allies to hit 2 percent of their GDP, with Washington likely to make the argument that the health crisis should not be allowed to turn into a security crisis.“But you’ll hear a substantially different tone and a lot more emphasis on different capabilities,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.“It won’t be instrumentalized as a political weapon to beat up allies.”",Reuters

1106,"U.S. urban office market, stung by pandemic, hopes tech firms drive comeback
The growing footprint in New York of major tech companies like Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google has given property owners and brokers hope that once the coronavirus has been conquered demand for office space will quickly return to pre-pandemic levels.
FEB 26 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-property-tech/u-s-urban-office-market-stung-by-pandemic-hopes-tech-firms-drive-comeback-idUSKBN2AQ2KV,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The growing footprint in New York of major tech companies like Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google has given property owners and brokers hope that once the coronavirus has been conquered demand for office space will quickly return to pre-pandemic levels.But the popularity of working from home and the exodus of people from expensive coastal cities will likely weigh on demand and change workspace requirements, leaving office buildings that do not adjust less valuable.Big Tech’s expanding real estate clout already hides declining values for lower-quality properties.Prices for premier workspace in U.S. gateway cities have held or even risen during the pandemic in a flight to quality. But leasing volumes and number of buildings sold have plummeted, with valuations at the lower end falling, data shows.The pandemic has left a massive question mark hanging over the office sector, said Joe Gorin, head of U.S. real estate management and value-added investing at Barings in New York.“I know how people are going to use the hotel coming out of the pandemic. How are people going to use office buildings?” he asked. “There’s going to be some pain because we’re going to have to go through a restructuring of how people use space.”Companies need to make the office more compelling and allow busy work to be done at home, which means workspace demand might not grow, Gorin said. Buildings that cannot provide a great environment will become obsolete.“If you can own or create the right stuff, it’s going to be valuable,” he said. “Office can become more important and shrink as much as it can expand.”Limited data suggests buildings classified below the top Class A industry designation already have suffered a drop in value during the pandemic and could be poised for a further slide if a decline in demand persists.The amount of available office space has soared as tech companies have dumped excessive workspace, a sign of uncertainty among management about a company’s future workspace needs.Institutional investors have put transaction decisions on hold, with the sale of buildings in Manhattan valued at more than $100 million falling more than half to just 32 last year, research by brokerage Newmark Group Inc shows, using Real Capital Analytics data.Leasing activity has picked up after the New Year but is still far below pre-pandemic levels.The office sector is the hardest in commercial real estate to assess because leases generally are long-term commitments, said Sam Isaacson, president of Walker & Dunlop Investment Partners in Denver.“Eventually the cash flow streams have to match up with the asset value appreciation and when that doesn’t occur, that’s when we’re going to see some real pain,” Isaacson said.The number of virtual tours brokers conducted with clients fell 61% in December from a year earlier in seven U.S. gateway cities, according to data from View The Space Inc. Tours declined 74% in New York, the biggest drop outside of an 80% plunge in Seattle, the property technology firm said.A reversal of Seattle’s early recovery from the pandemic may suggest a significant embrace of more remote work in the city over the long-term, VTS said in the report.“Our data is pointing to the fact tech companies are still really comfortable working from home and they’re probably going to be the last ones to return to the office,” said Ryan Masiello, co-founder and chief strategy officer at VTS.Of the 115 people VTS has hired since March, Masiello has met none of them because they are all working remotely, he said.Tech companies led other industries for the second straight year in Manhattan leasing activity, brokerage CBRE Group Inc said in January. A decline in the technology sector’s real estate footprint would be significant for a property market looking to ride the growing digital economy.Brokers point to Amazon’s $978 million purchase of the Lord & Taylor building on Fifth Avenue last year and Facebook’s leasing of the Farley Building across from Madison Square Garden, as prime examples for Manhattan’s real estate prospects.The Amazon deal was valued at $1,466 a square foot, more than 10% above last year’s top-quartile average price, while Google’s billion-dollar deals in Chelsea and Hudson Square have redefined swaths of the city’s Far West Side.Scott Rechler, chief executive and chairman of closely held RXR Realty, one of the largest office building owners in New York, sees a growing disparity between high- and lower-quality properties.Companies need to re-imagine the workspace and how they engage with employees who expect properties to be well-located, energetic and have health and wellness centers, he said.“For buildings that can’t do that - they’re not in the right location, they’re older, they’re obsolete - it could be a meaningful free-fall in value,” Rechler said.Graphic-Tenant interest in Manhattan office space by category :",Reuters

So I think we have to encourage - and I think even mandate - that certain companies do this kind of reporting.”Testifying alongside Smith on Friday were SolarWinds Chief Executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna and FireEye Inc Chief Executive Kevin Mandia.Their appearance before the joint hearing of the House Committees on Oversight and Reform and Homeland Security comes three days after the trio testified before U.S. senators over the massive breach, which has ensnared nine American government agencies and more than 100 other organizations.Former SolarWinds Chief Executive Kevin Thompson, who stepped down shortly before the breach was announced, was also testifying on Friday.",Reuters

Edited excerpts are below.Q. How has the pandemic changed the focus of your business?A. We’re fundamentally a tech company. Over the last seven years, predating this pandemic, we already had strategies on tech-focused payments - where instead of taking your wallet out, sticking your card in a machine or paying in cash, you’re now just taking your phone and tapping a terminal with it. It’s safe commerce.When we saw the shutdown starting in March in the United States, we announced partnerships with Amazon and Google to put our businesses in the cloud and allow our customers to move more quickly online.Prior to the pandemic, it was nice to have a website, but after the pandemic it was a requirement to have a website or you’re not going to be in business.Q. What is an example of an area that boomed in the past year?A. Healthcare. Pre-pandemic, we had very small numbers in the Teledoc business (which involved patients seeing their doctors virtually).Last year, we had 15,000 Teledoc transactions in January and February. By the middle of the year that just exploded.In 2020, we did 1.4 million Teledoc visits. We had to move quickly to provide better networks, better customer service to support those kinds of volumes that we’d never seen before.Also, we service tens of thousands of quick-service restaurants around the world, every Burger King, Popeyes, Taco Bell.We do business with 26 of the top 40 quick-service restaurants in the United States. We had to move pretty quickly on additional software and support to make sure that your experience in getting delivery from Doordash or Uber Eats was seamless.We facilitated $1.5 billion sales from quick-service restaurants in 2020 (compared to the $271 million the company did in 2019). That’s astronomical growth.Q. How has your life changed in the past year?A. Pre-pandemic, probably five to 10 days a month, I was on the road.The businesses we have are 70% in the United States, but we also have a billion in revenue and a third of our staff outside of the United States.Seeing customers and partners in the field, where they live and work, that’s really the best way to do it.During COVID, that pendulum (of travel) has swung in the other direction. I spend a lot more time now with my family, which is fantastic, but there really is no substitute for seeing firsthand how someone is doing or what we should be doing differently somewhere.Q. Have you developed any new work habits?A. I’ve always been a big believer in returning emails quickly and being available on cellphone, text or Zoom.But in this environment, when we have less face-to-face interaction, we’ve got to make sure we really engage with customers, partners and team members, to be even more accessible digitally when you’re separated physically.When someone sends you something, you’ve got to get on it right away, because that’s the substitute in this environment for a business trip or a face to face.You’ve got to be more responsive and more flexible than before. If you’re not, people are just going to think you just don’t care.",Reuters

The U.S. government next week will begin to gradually process thousands of asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under a controversial program put in place by former President Donald Trump, officials said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-immigration-asylum/biden-to-bring-in-asylum-seekers-forced-to-wait-in-mexico-under-trump-program-idUSKBN2AC113,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government next week will begin to gradually process thousands of asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under a controversial program put in place by former President Donald Trump, officials said.The moves are part of a plan by the administration of President Joe Biden to end the program, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), an effort complicated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and concerns over illegal immigration.The Trump administration launched the program in 2019 as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on the ability to seek asylum in the United States, which Trump officials depicted as rife with fraud and meritless claims.The initiative forced more than 65,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers back across the border to wait for their U.S. court hearings, although far fewer are believed to still be waiting in Mexico.The Biden administration will begin by working to process about 25,000 migrants with active claims in the program, officials said on Thursday. The new guidelines will require migrants to register online or via phone, be tested for the coronavirus in Mexico and then come to a U.S. port of entry on a specific day.The news was welcomed with relief in a sprawling migrant camp in the Mexican city of Matamoros, just across the border from Brownsville, Texas.“I’ve been reading all the articles,” said Salvadoran asylum seeker Sandra Andrade, who has been waiting in Mexico for over a year to resolve her U.S. court case. “Honestly, I have no words for how I’m feeling right now!”Biden vowed on the campaign trail to roll back restrictive Trump-era immigration policies, including MPP, which is informally known as “remain in Mexico.” His administration suspended new entries into the program when he took office on Jan. 20, but did not immediately put forward a plan to bring the people enrolled in it into the United States. Some have been waiting for as long as two years.Republicans embracing Trump’s hardline immigration views have criticized the ending of MPP and could use it as fuel for political attacks if illegal border crossings increase on Biden’s watch.Top Biden officials have stressed in recent weeks that migrants should not attempt to enter the United States, saying they need time to build up the capacity to process more asylum seekers.“Individuals who are not eligible under this initial phase should wait for further instructions and not travel to the border,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement accompanying the MPP announcement. “Due to the current pandemic, restrictions at the border remain in place and will be enforced.”Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador echoed that message on Friday, saying migrants should not think “the gates of the northern border are open” or believe human smugglers who say as much.During a call with reporters on Thursday evening, three Biden administration officials described the plans to process MPP enrollees, with the first phase beginning on Feb. 19.The officials, all of whom requested anonymity, only outlined procedures for people with active cases in U.S. immigration courts. Those with non-active cases, many of whom may have returned to their home countries, “will have other opportunities,” one of the officials said.Under the plan, migrants will need to register with international organizations over the internet or by phone and await instructions. One of the organizations will also handle coronavirus testing in Mexico, another official said.Biden officials declined to identify the organizations on Thursday. However, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said the refugee agency would work with both the U.S. and Mexican governments to ensure migrants in the program could safely enter the United States.The migrants’ claims will initially be heard at three ports of entry along the border, with organizations working to identify those in line the longest and those deemed particularly vulnerable.At two of the ports, the Biden administration expects to process 300 people per day at each port. The effort will expand to additional ports over time.“We will start small,” said one of the officials.The Biden officials declined to name the ports where the administration planned to begin processing, citing concerns that people would rush to those locations.Migrants entering the United States through the program will not be placed in detention centers, but could be subject to an alternative form of monitoring, including ankle bracelets.The United States developed the strategy in close coordination with Mexican authorities, the official said.Even while Biden moves to end one Trump program, he faces growing pressure from advocates to end another known as Title 42. The pandemic-era order allows U.S. authorities to rapidly expel to Mexico migrants caught crossing the border illegally, a practice advocates say bypasses due process.The Biden administration has not said whether it will end that program. More than 400,000 migrants have been expelled under the measure since it became effective in March 2020, although many of those caught are repeat border crossers and therefore counted multiple times.The effort to process MPP enrollees comes as arrests of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border have been increasing after a steep drop at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.",Reuters

The evidence suggests that Caldwell “engaged in planning and communications with others ... to plan a potential military-like incursion on the Capitol,” Mehta said.Followers of then president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol to disrupt the certification by lawmakers of Joe Biden’s election victory after months of Trump making unsubstantiated claims the vote was fraudulent. The riots led to five deaths, including a police officer. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives on a charge of inciting an insurrection and is being tried in the Senate.In court on Friday, Caldwell grew agitated as Mehta discussed his ruling and read aloud snippets of texts and other evidence prosecutors had gathered against him, and interrupted the proceeding to object that things were taken out of context.“Anything you say on this record could be used against you,” Mehta reminded him.In court filings this week, prosecutors said the FBI had found a document entitled “Death List” during a search of Caldwell’s home with the hand-written name of an election official in another state.Prosecutors declined to identify the name of the election official in open court on Friday, except to say the official had received some publicity because of the 2020 presidential election and is not from Caldwell’s home state of Virginia.The Justice Department has said it has evidence of extensive planning by Caldwell, Watkins and Crowl ahead of the Jan. 6 riots, including a plot to stage an armed “quick reaction force” outside of Washington that would be ready to swoop in and fight “hand to hand” if ordered by Trump.The judge also said he found it “astonishing” that Caldwell allegedly exchanged messages with an associate of another militia group called the “Three Percenters” to discuss the idea of transporting weapons across the Potomac River.Caldwell’s attorney denied his client is a member of the Oath Keepers or that he ever actually entered the U.S. Capitol building itself, citing physical ailments that would have prevented him from doing so.Prosecutors on Friday acknowledged they don’t have evidence Caldwell is a “dues-paying” member, but said he nevertheless has strong ties to the group.",Reuters

He is the first to acknowledge this is not the standard of behavior set out by the President.”Ducklo, McCammond and Palmeri did not respond to emails seeking comment. An Axios spokeswoman said McCammond disclosed the relationship to her editors in November and was reassigned from a beat covering the White House.The suspension comes after Democratic President Joe Biden, who took office last month, vowed to take a hard line on any incivility among members of his administration.“If you’re ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot ... no ifs, ands or buts,” Biden told political appointees during a virtual swearing-in ceremony. “Everybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity.”Psaki told reporters during a briefing on Friday that Biden was not involved in the decision to suspend Ducklo and stressed that the White House took the matter seriously.Ducklo’s behavior was “completely unacceptable. He knows that,” Psaki said. “We’ve had conversations with him. ... This will never happen again.”",Reuters

Many industry executives see little chance that blocks on the sale of billions of dollars of U.S. technology and chips to the Chinese company, which has denied wrongdoing, will be reversed by his successor.A Huawei spokesman denied the company plans to design EVs or produce Huawei branded vehicles.“Huawei is not a car manufacturer. However through ICT (information and communications technology), we aim to be a digital car-oriented and new-added components provider, enabling car OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to build better vehicles.”Huawei has started internally designing the EVs and approaching suppliers at home, with the aim of officially launching the project as early as this year, three of the sources said.Richard Yu, head of Huawei’s consumer business group who led the company to become one of the world’s largest smartphone makers, will shift his focus to EVs, said one source. The EVs will target a mass-market segment, another source said.All the sources declined to be named as the discussions are private.Chongqing-based Changan, which is making cars with Ford Motor Co, declined to comment. BAIC BluePark did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Shares of Changan’s main listed company Chongqing Changan Automobile rose 8% after Reuters reported the discussions. BluePark’s shares jumped by their maximum 10% daily limit.Chinese technology firms have been stepping up their focus on EVs in the world’s biggest market for such vehicles, as Beijing heavily promotes greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including pure battery electric vehicles as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, are expected to make up 20% of China’s overall annual auto sales by 2025.Industry forecasts put China’s NEV sales at 1.8 million units this year, up from about 1.3 million in 2020.Huawei’s ambitious plans to make its own cars will see it join a raft of Asian tech companies that have made similar announcements in recent months, including Baidu Inc and Foxconn.“The novel and complicated U.S. restrictions on semiconductors to Huawei have slowly been strangling the company,” said Dan Wang, a technology analyst with research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.“So it makes sense that the company is pivoting to less chip-intensive industries in order to maintain operations.”In the United States, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc are also developing auto-related technology or investing in smart-car startups.Huawei has been developing a swathe of technologies for EVs for years including in-car software systems, sensors for automobiles and 5G communications hardware.The company has also formed partnerships with automakers such as Daimler AG, General Motors Co and SAIC Motor to jointly develop smart auto technologies.It has accelerated hiring of engineers for auto-related technologies since 2018.Huawei was awarded at least four patents related to EVs this week, including methods for charging between electric vehicles and for checking battery health, according to official Chinese patent records.Huawei’s push into the EV market is currently separate from a joint smart vehicle company it co-founded along with Changan and EV battery maker CATL in November, two of the sources said.",Reuters

Canada and other countries have shown interest in replicating Australia’s reforms.“Global tech giants, they are changing the world but we can’t let them run the world,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday, adding that Big Tech must be accountable to sovereign governments.Facebook, whose 8-day ban on Australian media captured global attention, said it had signed partnership agreements with Schwartz Media, Solstice Media and Private Media. The trio own a mix of publications, including weekly newspapers, online magazines and specialist periodicals.Facebook did not disclose the financial details of the agreements, which will become effective within 60 days if a full deal is signed.“These agreements will bring a new slate of premium journalism, including some previously paywalled content, to Facebook,” the social media company said in a statement.The non-binding agreements allay some fears that small Australian publishers would be left out of revenue-sharing deals with Facebook and Google.“It’s never been more important than it is now to have a plurality of voices in the Australian press,” said Schwartz Media Chief Executive Rebecca Costello.Facebook on Tuesday struck a similar agreement with Seven West Media, which owns a free-to-air television network and the main metropolitian newspaper in the city of Perth.The Australian Broadcasting Corp has said it was also in talks with Facebook.Google Australia managing director Mel Silva said in a statement published on Friday the company had found a “constructive path to support journalism”.She thanked Australian users of the search engine for “bearing with us while we’ve sent you messages about this issue”.Facebook and Google threatened for months to pull core services from Australia if the media laws, which some industry players claim are more about propping up ailing local media, took effect.While Google struck deals with several publishers including News Corp as the legislation made its way through parliament, Facebook took the more drastic step of blocking all news content in Australia.That stance led to amendments to the laws, including giving the government the power to exempt Facebook or Google from mandatory arbitration, and Facebook on Friday began restoring the Australian news sites.",Reuters

Nissan Motor Co said on Friday it has reached a breakthrough in achieving a 50% thermal efficiency with its in-development e-POWER hybrid technology, which could lead to a further reduction of car CO2 emissions.
FEB 26 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nissan-engine-epower/nissan-says-makes-breakthrough-with-engine-in-reducing-co2-emissions-idUSKBN2AQ1F7,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co said on Friday it has reached a breakthrough in achieving a 50% thermal efficiency with its in-development e-POWER hybrid technology, which could lead to a further reduction of car CO2 emissions.This new thermal efficiency level would improve fuel consumption by 25% over the 40% thermal efficiency level in the upcoming e-POWER engine, the company said.“Nissan’s latest approach to engine development has raised the bar to world-leading levels, accelerating past the current auto industry average range of 40% thermal efficiency, making it possible to even further reduce vehicle CO2 emissions,” the company said in a statement.Nissan did not disclose when the e-POWER technology with 50% thermal efficiency would be launched.Toshihiro Hirai, senior vice president of the powertrain and EV engineering division at Nissan, told reporters on Friday that the automaker is maximising the thermal efficiency of e-POWER in order to reduce CO2 emissions while driving.The e-POWER, first introduced in Japan in 2016, uses a gasoline engine to charge a battery that powers the vehicle.“It took 50 years to increase thermal efficiency (of conventional engines) from 30% to 40%,” Hirai said.“But with e-POWER, we can increase it to 50% in several years. That has been the target for the engineering community,” he said, describing that level as the “ultimate, challenging goal”.To achieve this, Nissan said it strengthened in-cylinder gas flow and ignition, which burns a more diluted air-fuel mixture at a high compression ratio.“Without building up these fundamental technologies, we are unable to attain carbon neutrality,” said Hirai.The automaker said last month that all of its new models in key markets would be electrified by the early 2030s to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.Nissan has also said it expects sales of more than one million electrified vehicles per year by the end of fiscal 2023.",Reuters

1124,"Analysis: Hyundai bought chips when rivals didn't; its assembly lines are still rolling
Hyundai Motor has so far avoided a chip shortage that has plagued global automakers, largely maintaining its stockpile of chips last year and even accelerating purchases towards the end, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
FEB 26 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-semiconductors-hyundai-motor-an/analysis-hyundai-bought-chips-when-rivals-didnt-its-assembly-lines-are-still-rolling-idUSKBN2AQ0EF,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor has so far avoided a chip shortage that has plagued global automakers, largely maintaining its stockpile of chips last year and even accelerating purchases towards the end, three people with knowledge of the matter said.The shortage has forced production cuts worldwide, including at Volkswagen and General Motors, prompting Germany and the United States to ramp up efforts to resolve the shortage.Other than Japan’s Toyota Motor, which said this month it had enough chip inventory to last it about four months, Hyundai and its sister firm Kia Corp are the only global automakers to have maintained a stockpile of low-tech chips that helped them keep up production.If it doesn’t ease soon, though, the shortage could hit Hyundai too, as tight capacity on factory floors starts pressuring production of even high-tech auto chips, said two of the people, who are familiar with the company’s purchases.The South Korean automaker kept buying chips even as rivals cut orders to reflect diminished demand because of the pandemic.Analysts said past events that roiled Hyundai’s supply chain and forced it to halt production have shaped this more conservative take on inventory, a departure from automakers’ typical just-in-time approach.“Like other automakers, Hyundai also planned to cut production at the beginning of the year because of COVID-19,” said one of the people with direct knowledge of Hyundai’s purchases.“But procurement read the trend of the semiconductor industry cutting auto chips production and said, ‘if we don’t buy them as well, we’ll be in trouble later on,’” said the person, referring to a rush of buying by gadget makers that sucked up most chipmaking capacity.Chipmakers who supply auto companies outsource most of their production to contract manufacturers like Taiwan’s TSMC, which analysts say often prioritise orders from electronics clients who account for nearly all their revenue.Hyundai still bought fewer chips in 2020 than it did in 2019, said one of the sources with direct knowledge of auto chip production. But it sharply increased buying in the quarter that ended in December, the person said.The people declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to media.The fact that Hyundai’s domestic market was relatively solid through the pandemic most likely influenced the company’s plans, analysts said, as did its experiences with China and Japan.Hyundai took lessons from a diplomatic spat with Japan in 2019 that affected supplies here of chemicals at South Korean chipmakers, and in early 2020, when the coronavirus was spreading in China, production was halted in Hyundai and Kia's plants because of shortages of a part from China.A spokeswoman told Reuters Hyundai was collaborating with its suppliers to maintain stable production.Since Hyundai kept buying from chipmakers and global auto parts suppliers such as Bosch and Continental before the shortage worsened, they also managed to keep costs down.“This has allowed Hyundai to first, secure auto chips, and second, buy them when they were cheaper,” said Kim Jin-woo, analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.Hyundai also has more local suppliers than rivals.These suppliers - including Telechips, which contracts fabrication out to Samsung Electronics - are likely to prioritise Hyundai, from whom they get much of their revenue, analysts said.One person with direct knowledge of Hyundai’s purchasing decisions said the company has diversified suppliers for at least one chip since late last year.In a statement on Thursday, Hyundai said it plans to halt operations at one South Korean factory for five days in March to adjust inventories of some models.A union official told Reuters the company was trying to save chips by adjusting production of its weaker-selling Sonata model. Sonata in South Korea sold 67,440 units last year versus 145,463 units of Hyundai’s most popular sedan Grandeur.According to an internal document seen by Reuters, Hyundai expects the shortage to ease in the third quarter, and Kia said last month that since October it had been reviewing its supply chain to prevent production disruption.“We would not say we are prepared for the next three to six months, but we could tell you that we are not seeing any immediate production disruption,” Kia said on an earnings call last month.Still, there is rising concern at Hyundai, two of the three people said. The company is checking inventory more frequently and trying to lock down supply contracts earlier, one of them said.The union official said Hyundai had told the union this week that Hyundai “had secured a lot of chips” but that the situation was becoming “a bit difficult”.“Clients are trying to pull all they can, while suppliers are being strategic about which order they meet,” said the source with direct knowledge of auto chip production. “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.”",Reuters

The government has already moved to restrict fishing around the areas Maui dolphins frequent.“By advancing our understanding of how Māui dolphins behave during the day and throughout the year this project will help us ensure the measures our Government has already put in place to protect our Māui dolphins are robust and appropriate,” said Oceans and Fisheries Minister David Parker.The drone ensures dolphins remain undisturbed as they fly at an altitude of over 120 metres (394 feet).",Reuters

This is about as busy as you‘ll get for weather across the country,” Chenard said on Friday.Bitter cold was already gripping the Plains on Friday, just a day after winter weather battered the United Statesfrom coast to coast, including freezing rain as far south as Fort Worth, Texas, where six people died in a multi-vehicle pileup.Temperatures as low as minus 45 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 43 Celsius) gripped Montana and Minnesota as cities such as Bismarck, North Dakota, shivered at minus 26 F (minus 32 C).“North Dakota is all fun and games until you have to be working in negative 40 degree weather,” @BricFlare wrote in a Twitter post.The Plains states will see significant snowfalls of 6 or more inches and freezing rain from Sunday into Monday, the weather service’s Chenard said, with the threat of freezing rain as far south as Houston and Louisiana.In the U.S. Northwest, snow and freezing rain blasting Portland, Oregon, and Seattle on Friday was expected to linger into Saturday.By Saturday night, freezing rain was expected in areas around the nation’s capital, including Virginia and Maryland, Chenard said.A wintry mix was expected to pelt the Northeast, where accumulations were expected to be minimal, although any slickness on roadways heightens travel risks.“It shouldn’t account for too much, but if it’s freezing rain, that can cause issues even if it’s light,” Chenard said.",Reuters
1129,Delay in U.S. census data could muddle 2022 congressional elections,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-census/delay-in-u-s-census-data-could-muddle-2022-congressional-elections-idUSKBN2AC2G1,"(Reuters) - U.S. census data used once a decade to redraw legislative districts will not be made available until September, officials said on Friday, a delay that could make it difficult for states to finish new maps in time for the 2022 congressional elections.In announcing a new release date of Sept. 30, the Census Bureau cited lingering delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the bureau to shut down many of its data collection operations last spring as lockdowns swept the country.The bureau had previously set a target of July, which was already months later than the data is typically provided to states.Every 10 years, states employ the fresh census data to draw the lines for members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as thousands of state legislative offices.Some good-government groups have expressed concern that the compressed timeline could make it easier for lawmakers to engage in gerrymandering, the process by which maps are deliberately skewed to benefit one political party over another.If new maps are drawn late in 2021, that would leave little time for legal challenges to work their way through the courts before filing deadlines for elections. In Illinois and Texas, two states where one party holds unilateral power to redraw legislative boundaries, candidates must file before year’s end to run for office in 2022.“You’re starting to bump redistricting up against the election cycle,” said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. “There’s less time to challenge maps. That puts a lot of pressure on civil rights groups.”The only two states that have legislative elections in 2021, Virginia and New Jersey, will be forced to use existing maps as a result of the postponement.“This was a census like no other,” Kathleen Styles, a Census Bureau official, said on a call with reporters on Friday. “COVID-19 was definitely the driving factor in our schedule here.”The state-level population figures that determine whether states will gain or lose U.S. House seats will be available in April, but the more specific data needed to draw maps will be delayed.Democrats hold a slim 10-seat majority in the House, and some analysts have said that a combination of reapportionment and gerrymandering could be enough to swing the majority. Texas and Florida, two states that are controlled by Republicans and have seen aggressive gerrymanders in previous cycles, are expected to gain three seats and two seats, respectively.A Brennan Center analysis issued on Thursday found that Republicans would have sole control over the drawing of 181 congressional seats, compared with only 49 for Democrats.The delay also may force states to pass legislation extending redistricting deadlines or turn to the courts to seek extensions. Half of U.S. states have either a constitutional or statutory deadline calling for new maps in 2021, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",Reuters

The stock closed for the day at $108.73 for an 18.5% gain, after soaring almost 90% at the session peak.Other “stonks” or “meme stocks” popular on sites such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets also saw their rallies fade. Headphone company Koss Corp closed up 16.8% gain after rocketing nearly 61% during the session. AMC Entertainment ended down nearly 9% after jumping more than 15% during the session.Analysts were puzzled by the rally that came even as the benchmark S&P dropped 2.4%. Some ruled out a short squeeze like the one in January that battered hedge funds that had bet against GameStop and were forced to cover short positions when individual investors using Robinhood and other trading apps pushed the video game retailer’s shares as high as $483.“The power of the “three R’s” (Robinhood, Retail, Reddit) are back in play,” said Neil Campling, head of technology research at Mirabaud Securities.The number of GameStop shares shorted stood at 15.47 million, analytics firm S3 Partners said Thursday, with short interest accounting for 28.4% of the float, compared with a peak of 142% in early January.Wednesday’s late day rally added $664 million in mark-to-market losses for investors betting against GameStop, and short sellers were down $10.75 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses midday Thursday, according to S3.Some analysts said the rally may be partly fueled by a fear of betting against GameStop.“There are not a lot of people who are just sitting there, ‘oh yeah, let’s for fun, let’s just short GameStop and get my head ripped off.’ The investors learn.,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading, on the Benzinga podcast.Some investors may be jumping on the GameStop bandwagon hoping to reap gains similar to turbo-charged advances of January and then sell the stock, said David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis at Simpler Trading.“All of these stocks are once again rising together. It demonstrates that there is nothing intrinsic in the companies themselves,” he said.Former GameStop shortseller Citron Research said the company should buy online gambling company Esports Entertainment Group Inc“It would be an easy acquisition for GameStop to tuck in right now,” Citron’s Andrew Left told Reuters in an interview. “Some people say it would be a ‘Hail Mary pass’ but I think it would be a major pivot.”More than 145 million shares of GameStop had changed hands by mid-morning, almost triple its 30-day average volume of 62 million, yet below the more than 190 million shares that traded hands daily in late January.The surge came after Reddit trader Keith Gill, who runs the YouTube channel Roaring Kitty, bought additional GameStop shares last week. Last week, Gill testified in the U.S. Congress: “I like the stock,” words since quoted by hundreds of online followers and featured in memes on financial sites.This week’s GameStop rally began the day after the retailer announced the resignation of Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell as the company focuses on shifting into technology-driven sales.Reddit forums were buzzing again with bullish GameStop posts on Thursday.“Bought lots more #GME today, let’s keep fighting !!,” wrote Reddit user Fundssqueezzer.In January, GameStop shares skyrocketed by more than 1600% as retail investors, urged on by WallStreetBets, bought shares to punish hedge funds that had taken an outsized short bet against it.Gabriel Plotkin’s Melvin Capital hedge fund was left needing a $2.75 billion lifeline from Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management.Investing legend Charlie Munger, longtime business partner of Warren Buffett, criticized the risky trading strategies employed by some traders on Reddit.“It’s really stupid to have a culture which encourages as much gambling in stocks by people who have the mindset of racetrack bettors,” said Munger, Berkshire Hathaway’s vice chairman.",Reuters

But this episode provides a very useful reminder that EV manufacturing is subject to periodic supply chain bottlenecks, whether related to chips, or batteries, or other components,” Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said by email.Samsung Electronics, which supplies chips that control self-driving capabilities to Tesla, last week said it had suspended its factory in Austin, Texas as a winter storm caused power outages. The Tesla chips are made in the Texas factory, the automaker said two years ago.Samsung declined to identify its customers for the factory.It was unclear how much volume or revenue Tesla would lose due to the production halt. The Fremont plant has an annual production capacity of 500,000 Model 3s and Model Ys combined.Tesla last week reduced the price of its cheaper variants of the Model 3 and the Model Y, the latest in a series of price cuts at a time when legacy automakers are trying to fight back with new models.",Reuters
1135,"Microsoft failed to shore up defenses that could have limited SolarWinds hack: U.S. senator
Microsoft Corp's failure to fix known problems with its cloud software facilitated the massive SolarWinds hack that compromised at least nine federal government agencies, according to security experts and the office of U.S. Senator Ron Wyden.
FEB 25 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-solarwinds-microsoft/microsoft-failed-to-shore-up-defenses-that-could-have-limited-solarwinds-hack-u-s-senator-idUSKBN2AP2XD,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s failure to fix known problems with its cloud software facilitated the massive SolarWinds hack that compromised at least nine federal government agencies, according to security experts and the office of U.S. Senator Ron Wyden.A vulnerability first publicly revealed by researchers in 2017 allows hackers to fake the identity of authorized employees to gain access to customers’ cloud services. The technique was one of many used in the SolarWinds hack.Wyden, who has faulted tech companies on security and privacy issues as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, blasted Microsoft for not doing more to prevent forged identities or warn customers about it.“The federal government spends billions on Microsoft software,” Wyden told Reuters ahead of a SolarWinds hearing on Friday in the House of Representatives.“It should be cautious about spending any more before we find out why the company didn’t warn the government about the hacking technique that the Russians used, which Microsoft had known about since at least 2017,” he said.Microsoft President Brad Smith will testify on Friday before the House committee investigating the SolarWinds hacks.U.S. officials have blamed Russia for the massive intelligence operation that penetrated SolarWinds, which makes software to manage networks, as well as Microsoft and others, to steal data from multiple governments and about 100 companies. Russia denies responsibility.Microsoft disputed Wyden’s conclusions, telling Reuters that the design of its identity services was not at fault.In a response to Wyden’s written questions on Feb. 10, a Microsoft lobbyist said the identity trick, known as Golden SAML, “had never been used in an actual attack” and “was not prioritized by the intelligence community as a risk, nor was it flagged by civilian agencies.”But in a public advisory after the SolarWinds hack, on Dec. 17, the National Security Agency called for closer monitoring of identity services, noting, “This SAML forgery technique has been known and used by cyber actors since at least 2017.”In response to additional questions from Wyden this week, Microsoft acknowledged its programs were not set up to detect the theft of identity tools for granting cloud access.Trey Herr, director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said the failure showed cloud security risks should be a higher priority.The hackers’ sophisticated abuse of identities “exposes a concerning weakness in how cloud computing giants invest in security, perhaps failing to adequately mitigate the risk of high impact, low probability failures in systems at the root of their security model,” Herr said.In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Microsoft’s Smith said that only about 15% of the victims in the Solar Winds campaign were hurt via Golden SAML. Even in those cases the hackers had to have already gained access to systems before deploying the method.But Wyden’s staff said one of those victims was the U.S. Treasury, which lost emails from dozens of officials.",Reuters

Dorsey said any changes to Section 230, a U.S. law that shields online companies from liability over content posted by users, must be made carefully.Internationally, Twitter faces challenges in India, a rapidly growing market with plans to require that social media companies erase certain content and coordinate with law enforcement.Twitter had previously refused to delete content connected to farmers’ protests in India.",Reuters

1139,"Exclusive: CoreLogic asks CoStar for assurances on antitrust risk - sources
U.S. property data and analytics company CoreLogic Inc has asked peer CoStar Group Inc for more assurances that it can complete their combination should it attract antitrust scrutiny, people familiar with the matter said.
FEB 25 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corelogic-m-a-costar-group-exclusive/exclusive-corelogic-asks-costar-for-assurances-on-antitrust-risk-sources-idUSKBN2AP2Q6,"(Reuters) - U.S. property data and analytics company CoreLogic Inc has asked peer CoStar Group Inc for more assurances that it can complete their combination should it attract antitrust scrutiny, people familiar with the matter said.CoStar unveiled a $6.9 billion all-stock bid for CoreLogic earlier this month, after the latter agreed to sell itself to a private equity consortium of Stone Point Capital and Insight Partners for about $6 billion.CoreLogic has informed CoStar it would be willing to declare its bid superior and abandon its deal with the private equity firms if CoStar provides more certainty that the transaction will be completed expeditiously, the sources said.A decline in recent days in CoStar shares has highlighted the need for such certainty for CoreLogic’s board, according to the sources. CoStar’s bid was worth $95.76 per share when it was unveiled on Feb. 16. It was worth about $82 per share on Thursday afternoon because of the decline in CoStar’s shares, only slightly more than the $80 per share all-cash bid CoreLogic accepted from Stone Point Capital and Insight Partners. The more time lapses, the more the value of CoStar’s bid could change.CoreLogic believes that CoStar could add cash to its bid to provide more certainty on the value of its offer, according to one of the sources.While some of CoreLogic’s demands involving technical aspects of the deal are expected to be ironed out with CoStar, the antitrust provisions remain a significant sticking point, the sources said.CoreLogic initially asked for a “hell-or-high-water” clause that would force CoStar to undertake all actions that antitrust regulators may request for the deal to happen, including any necessary divestitures, the sources said.It has since dropped this request but still wants CoStar to make commitments to closing the deal, including accepting a deadline for completing the transaction akin to the six-month deadline that the private equity firms agreed to, the sources said. CoStar is currently pushing for a 12-month deadline, the sources added.CoStar has argued there is little antitrust risk for the deal, and that regulators may be able to approve it in as little as one month, according to the sources.An attempt last year by CoStar to buy another company, apartment search site operator RentPath Holdings Inc, for $588 million was thwarted by U.S antitrust regulators. RentPath sued CoStar over the deal’s $58 million breakup fee, and last week reached a settlement recovering most of that fee.CoreLogic’s board wants to make sure that any deal it inks with CoStar does not get torpedoed by regulators, the sources said. It has asked for CoStar to pre-fund its proposed $330 million breakup fee, and also not to negotiate with potential acquirers of its assets until the deal closes, the sources added.It remains unclear whether CoStar and CoreLogic will be able to negotiate a deal, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the talks are confidential. CoStar and CoreLogic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The takeover interest in CoreLogic came after activist investors Senator Investment Group LP and Cannae Holdings Inc began pushing the company to seek a sale by mounting their own acquisition bid, which they abandoned once the sale process got under way.A big part of CoreLogic’s business is thriving, as low interest rates have fueled a boom in parts of the property market.CoStar, which also participated in the auction for CoreLogic before losing out to the private equity consortium, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat most analysts’ expectations. Yet its shares have been dropping amid a broader sell-off in technology stocks and uncertainty over its bid for CoreLogic.CoStar has said its acquisition of CoreLogic would result in $150 million to $250 million in annual cash flow synergies. It has argued those synergies alone are worth several billion dollars to shareholders of the combined company.It has also argued that it does not need to place an “equity collar” on its all-stock bid, which would protect CoreLogic shareholders from CoStar shares dropping too much, given the value of these synergies and the deal’s rational. CoreLogic, on the other hand, believes that the drop in CoStar’s shares shows the need for an equity collar, one of the sources said.CoreLogic shareholders would own 16.2% of the combined company under CoStar’s terms. Were it to sweeten its bid further by offering more of its shares, it would trigger a requirement under its bylaws for CoStar shareholders to vote on the deal. Under the proposed offer, only CoreLogic shareholders need to vote on the deal should its board approve it.",Reuters

1141,"Biden presses for $1.9 trillion COVID relief plan with governors, mayors
U.S. President Joe Biden pushed for the first major legislative achievement of his term on Friday, turning to a bipartisan group of local officials for help on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden/biden-presses-for-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-plan-with-governors-mayors-idUSKBN2AC10D,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden pushed for the first major legislative achievement of his term on Friday, turning to a bipartisan group of local officials for help on his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan.Biden invited a set of mayors and governors to the Oval Office and described what he said was a need to give those officials more help supporting millions of unemployed workers and reopening schools.“We need to help the states economically in terms of unemployment,” Biden said during a small part of the meeting that was open to reporters. “The federal government has a major role to play here.”The White House summit came as public health officials in the administration readied new guidelines for reopening schools and as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said “the time to go big is now” as she pushed for more stimulus globally during the first meeting of the Group of Seven wealthy economies since the new U.S. administration took office.The Democratic president’s proposed spending package, coming on top of $4 trillion enacted by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump, would have important consequences for a global economy that is slowly and unevenly recovering after last year suffering its worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.More than 400 mayors wrote to leaders in Congress earlier this month to urge them to pass Biden’s relief package, but Republicans are backing a plan with a much smaller price tag.Taking part in the Oval Office meeting were Republican and Democratic elected officials whose states and cities have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Many have seen tax revenues fall and costs soar as they race to vaccinate their citizens.The group includes four governors, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, and Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, and five mayors, including Jeff Williams of Arlington, Texas, a Republican.Williams, who met with Yellen virtually last week, said his city urgently needs the federal aid earmarked for state and local governments in Biden’s rescue plan. He said cities were crushed when Congress removed similar aid from a previous relief bill that passed in December.“We’ve been crippled. We haven’t gotten help,” Williams said in an interview. “Our property taxes are down and costs are way up. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican, this is the right solution so we can achieve economic growth much faster.”Arlington, which is home to the largest General Motors Co plant in the world, is bracing for a 10% drop in the appraised value of its commercial properties, which would cut revenues by some $30 million after an $18 million loss last year, Williams said.Biden on Thursday said the U.S. coronavirus death toll was likely to reach 500,000 next month, but said the United States was on track to have enough vaccine for 300 million Americans by the end of July.While economic growth is picking up, unemployment remains high and many communities of color are not expected to recover for years.",Reuters
1142,"If Senate does not convict Trump, 'he can do this again,' Democrats warn",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/if-senate-does-not-convict-trump-he-can-do-this-again-democrats-warn-idUSKBN2AB15F,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic prosecutors making the case that Donald Trump incited a deadly insurrection by encouraging his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol warned the Senate on Thursday that if it fails to convict the former president, “he can do this again.”The first three days of Trump’s impeachment trial focused on his fiery words to supporters in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, when he falsely claimed that his election defeat by Democrat Joe Biden was the result of fraud and that the crowd needed to “fight” and “stop the steal.”The Democrats appear highly unlikely to secure a conviction and bar Trump from ever again holding public office given that only six Republicans voted with Democrats in the 100-seat chamber to proceed with the trial.“If he gets back into office and it happens again, we’ll have no one to blame but ourselves,” lead impeachment manager Representative Jamie Raskin told the Senate on Thursday, wrapping up the prosecution arguments.Fellow Democratic Representative Ted Lieu told the senators he worries about what would happen if Trump runs in 2024 and loses.“I’m not afraid of Donald Trump running again in four years. I’m afraid he’s going to run again and lose, because he can do this again,” Lieu said.The Democratic prosecutors provided example after example of Trump’s actions prior to the rampage to illustrate what he intended when he told supporters to go to the Capitol and “fight like hell” as Congress convened to certify Biden’s election victory.“Jan. 6 was not some unexpected radical break from his normal law-abiding and peaceful disposition. ... This was his essential M.O.,” Raskin said, using shorthand for modus operandi.“He knew that egged on by his tweets, his lies and his promise of a ‘wild’ time in Washington to guarantee his grip on power, his most extreme followers would show up bright and early, ready to attack, ready to engage in violence, ready to ‘fight like hell’ for their hero,” he said.The Democratic-led House on Jan. 13 charged Trump with inciting an insurrection. His term ended on Jan. 20.A two-thirds majority in the Senate would be needed to convict, which means at least 17 Republican senators would have to defy Trump, who remains popular with most Republican voters and has shown interest in running for president again in 2024.Dozens of former Republican officials who said they are frustrated with their party’s unwillingness to stand up to Trump are in talks to form a center-right breakaway party, four people involved in the discussions told Reuters.The nine House impeachment managers have argued that Trump planted the seeds for the riot by encouraging violence and making false claims about widespread electoral fraud long before Jan. 6, and must be held accountable for what happened.Five people including a police officer died in the riot. Two more police officers involved in the response died by suicide in the days afterward.Although the prosecutors’ arguments were generally praised by both parties, some Republican senators said they were still not convinced.During a break in the proceedings on Thursday, Senator James Lankford told reporters that the managers failed to connect the dots between Trump and the rioters.Senator James Inhofe said: “It’s just redundant, the same thing over and over again. ... To me, the more you hear it, the less credibility there is in it.”Trump adviser Jason Miller said on Twitter that the defense would wrap up its case on Friday, and some Republican senators said they expected the proceedings to end on Saturday.Looking ahead to Trump’s defense, the House managers disagreed that his incendiary language is protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects free speech.“The First Amendment does not create some superpower immunity from impeachment for a president who attacks the Constitution in word and deed while rejecting the outcome of an election,” Raskin said.The House managers spent much of Wednesday recounting the events that led to the riot and highlighting the threat to lawmakers and to Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president, including searing security footage.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden watched some of the video on Thursday morning, adding: “Anyone who watched that video ... found it harrowing and deeply disturbing. That’s certainly how the president felt.”In a separate court case, federal prosecutors said on Thursday that anti-government “Oath Keepers” militia members devised elaborate plans to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6 and plotted to have an armed “quick reaction force” staged outside the city ready “to fight hand to hand” if ordered by Trump.Trump is the first U.S. president to be impeached twice and the first to face trial after leaving office. His first impeachment trial, which stemmed from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, ended in an acquittal a year ago in what was then a Republican-controlled Senate.On Thursday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer left open the possibility that Congress might seek a different way to punish Trump if the Senate acquits him. That includes potentially invoking the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which gives Congress the power to bar public officials from holding office if they engaged in insurrection or rebellion.",Reuters
1143,Prominent anti-Trump Republicans reject third party,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-third-party-insight/prominent-anti-trump-republicans-reject-third-party-idUSKBN2AC053,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former Republican officials considering a new center-right political party to counter former President Donald Trump’s influence would face steep challenges in shaking up a U.S. political system that has favored two-party rule throughout its history.Reuters exclusively reported on Wednesday that more than 120 Republicans - including former elected officials, along with former administrators under Trump and former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush - met virtually on Feb. 5 to discuss forming a third party or a new center-right faction.Two of the most prominent anti-Trump Republicans in Congress - Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois - rejected the idea of a breakaway party in statements to Reuters on Thursday. Other Republican critics of Trump expressed similar skepticism - arguing a third party would accomplish little beyond splitting the votes of conservatives and helping Democrats get elected.The resistance to a third party among some of Trump’s toughest Republican critics underscores the extreme difficulty of such a political revolt. Such an effort would require walking away from the Republican Party’s massive political infrastructure - staff, money, connections and data on donors and voters - that would take years if not decades to build from scratch.An upstart party would also have little chance of succeeding without a charismatic leader who could capture the loyalties of millions of disaffected voters, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a senior advisor to the Republican primary campaign of Marco Rubio, a Senator from Florida, in 2016.“If somebody was going to start a third party that was going to gain some traction, it would be Trump” and not his opponents, said Conant.Kinzinger joined the Feb. 5 video conference of the anti-Trump group and spoke for about five minutes, a spokeswoman told Reuters. But the congressman wants to “reform the party from within,” she said. He has recently formed a new political action committee to support Republican primary challengers running against pro-Trump House Republicans such as Matt Gaetz, of Florida, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia.A spokesman for Cheney told Reuters in a statement that she opposes “any effort to split the party,” saying it would only make it easier for Democrats to enact policies that conservatives oppose.Both Cheney and Kinzinger were among just 10 House Republicans, a small minority, who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.A more likely outcome of an anti-Trump movement would be for centrist Republicans to try to purge Trumpism from within its own ranks, said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida who recently quit the party in protest of Trump and declared himself an independent.A party of center-right conservatives could never create a broad enough coalition to win national elections, Jolly said. And Trump has effectively undercut his more moderate opponents among Republican voters, he said, by ridiculing them as “Never Trumpers” and “RINOs” (Republicans in Name Only).“It’s just impossible to escape the ‘never Trump’ label,” he said.Others argue it would be much harder to wrest power over the Republican Party from Trump.“Let’s not kid ourselves; we are not going to change this party,” said Jim Glassman, a former undersecretary of state under George W. Bush.Glassman gave a five-minute presentation on the Feb. 5 call advocating for a new party. Any effort to reclaim the party would be “a soul-deadening slog,” he told participants.He told Reuters on Thursday that he sees the Republican Party as now thoroughly in thrall to Trump - and beyond repair.“I thought, if Trump lost by 7 million votes, there may have been a chance to do that,” he said in an interview. “But events since the election have made clear that’s not going to happen.”Asked on Wednesday about the discussions for a third party, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said: “These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.”Glassman believes there are enough Republican donors who are disgusted with Trump and willing to finance a new party. He believes a new conservative party could also attract maybe one fifth of Republican voters who disapprove of Trump, along with some independents and Democrats. Further, he said, running third-party candidates in House and Senate races would force the Trumpist candidates to tack to the center in general elections and temper the shrill partisanship of those races.Many people at the Feb. 5 virtual gathering agreed with Glassman. In a poll of participants, about 40% of those in attendance supported creating an entirely new party, according to one source with direct knowledge of the discussions. About 20% favored creating a faction within the party, and an equal number supported creating a faction outside the party, though it remained unclear exactly how such an independent faction would operate.While they disagreed on strategy, participants in the meeting said, attendees united on the need to organize and advocate for a return to “principled conservatism” that prizes the rule of law and adherence to the Constitution, ideals they believe Trump has violated.Among the group at the Feb. 5 meeting was Elizabeth Neumann, former deputy chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump. She’s enraged at Republican lawmakers’ continued support for Trump in the wake of his stolen-election claims, which she had repeatedly warned - before the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots - could lead to violence. Now she wants to politically target the lawmakers who voted, in the hours after the deadly insurrection, to overturn the presidential election result - and she’s open to any strategy that might work.“I hear arguments that we should break off and form a new party, or we should stay inside the party. There will come a time when this crystallizes,” Neumann told Reuters on Thursday. “At the moment, I’m more focused on the individual people and holding them accountable.”Historically, third parties have generally failed in U.S. elections, particularly at the presidential level, often serving more as spoilers than true contenders.Theodore Roosevelt, a charismatic war hero, had served two previous terms as president but lost in 1912 when he ran as a Progressive - or “Bull Moose” - Party candidate, finishing second, with more votes than the Republican candidate, in a three-way race ultimately won by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. That was the last time any third-party candidate won more votes than either of the two major party presidential candidates.More recently, the most successful third-party candidate was Texas billionaire Ross Perot, whose self-financed Reform Party campaign in 1992 earned him 19% of the vote in a race won by Democrat Bill Clinton, who unseated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush.In other cases, supporters of losing presidential nominees have blamed third-party candidates for siphoning off voters. In 2016, some backers of Democrat Hillary Clinton were frustrated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose percentage of the vote was greater than Clinton’s margin of defeat in key states.Republican Senator Rand Paul, asked about the prospects for a new party, told Reuters: “That’d be a good way to allow the Democrats to always win.”Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn laughed when asked by Reuters about a possible third party.“More power to ‘em,” he said.Cornyn, however, predicted shared opposition to President Biden’s agenda will hold Republicans together. He said he hopes life in the Republican Party will return to something more normal in Trump’s absence.“It’s made us all a little crazy,” Cornyn said.",Reuters

The company said it had shipped a record 50.3 million units during 2020.A global shift to remote work and learning early last year had spiked demand for remote workstation products that benefited computer hardware makers and cloud service providers alike.Dell is in an advantaged position to capitalize on the projected mid-single digits growth in IT spending in 2021, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said.Revenue from its data center business was $8.8 billion in the quarter, in line with a year earlier, while sales at VMware Inc was $3.3 billion. Dell plans to spin off its 81% stake in the software unit to help reduce debt.Total revenue rose 9% to $26.1 billion in the three months ended Jan. 29, while analysts had estimated $24.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.2 billion from $408 million a year earlier, as it shaved off administrative costs by 19% in the quarter.",Reuters
1145,"India tightens regulatory grip on Facebook, WhatsApp with new rules
India announced new rules on Thursday to regulate content on social media, making Facebook, WhatsApp and others more accountable to legal requests for swift removal of posts and sharing details on the originators of messages.
FEB 25 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-tech-regulation/india-tightens-regulatory-grip-on-facebook-whatsapp-with-new-rules-idUSKBN2AP16V,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India announced new rules on Thursday to regulate content on social media, making Facebook, WhatsApp and others more accountable to legal requests for swift removal of posts and sharing details on the originators of messages.The rules -- part of an effort by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nationalist government to tighten the leash on Big Tech -- come after Twitter recently ignored government orders to drop content related to farmers’ protests.India is the largest market by users for both Facebook and its messenger service WhatsApp.The new rules issued by the government, called the Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, will be legally enforceable.They will require big social media companies to set up a grievance redressal mechanism and within three months appoint new executives to coordinate with law enforcement.Social media firms should be “more responsible and accountable,” Ravi Shankar Prasad, the minister for information technology, told reporters in outlining the rules.Big social media firms will be obliged to remove content within 36 hours of receiving a legal order, according to the rules.The government also said companies need to assist in probes or other cyber security-related incidents within 72 hours of receiving a request. They must also disable within a day any post depicting an individual in a sexual act or conduct, said the rules, a draft copy of which was reported by Reuters on Wednesday.IT minister Prasad also told reporters the rules would oblige the companies to reveal the originator of a message or post when legally ordered.Facebook said it welcomed rules that prescribe ways to address challenges on the web. “The details of rules like these matter and we will carefully study the new rules,” it said in a statement. Facebook-owned WhatsApp declined to comment.A Twitter spokesman said the company would study the guidelines and looked forward to continued engagement with the Indian government.“We believe that regulation is beneficial when it safeguards citizen’s fundamental rights and reinforces online freedoms,” he said in a statement.Tech firms are coming under tighter scrutiny worldwide. Facebook faced a backlash last week from some publishers and politicians after it blocked news feeds in Australia in a dispute with the government over revenue-sharing.That prompted last-ditch changes by Australia in a law passed on Thursday to ensure Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook pay media companies for content, a step that nations such as Britain and Canada want to follow.India’s rules will also require video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon’s Prime Video to classify content into five categories based on users’ age, the government said.Online news media will also be regulated as part of the new rules, with the ministry of information and broadcasting creating an oversight system, the government added.Apar Gupta, the executive director at advocacy Internet Freedom Foundation, said the new rules for digital news media portals and video-streaming platforms posed risks to freedom of speech.“To fix the problems in these sectors the government has adopted an approach which carries the risks of political control and censorship,” he said.",Reuters

He said he owns shares in Esports.Left’s suggestion sent Esports’ shares up roughly 27% to a three-year high before falling back down to $21, up a shade over 19%. GameStop’s shares were up nearly 60%%, extending a new rally that began on Wednesday.Esports said on Thursday it has not held sale talks with GameStop. GameStop did not comment.Jeff Cohen, vice president of strategy at Esports Entertainment, told Reuters the two companies have spoken in the past but not about an acquisition.“We have talked to GameStop in the past about areas within Esports where we might be able to collaborate, but we haven’t had any discussions around acquisitions,” Cohen said.Only four weeks ago, Left said he was betting against the future of GameStop, describing it as an outdated brand whose products were sold in shopping malls that weren’t being frequented much during the pandemic.“Six weeks ago this brand was (close to) being dead,” he said. Now it’s a “hot brand” that can raise money and reestablish itself as a strong player, he said, valuing the company at between $8 billion and $10 billion. GameStop was valued at around $6.4 billion before Thursday’s rally.“What’s changed? I realize that there are millions of kids in this country who like to gamble,” he said. “If they combined, as a short seller, I wouldn’t even think about touching that.”Left was one of the most prominent short-sellers betting against GameStop in January. Hedge funds, including Melvin Capital, were also hurt by their short bets against GameStop.Lawmakers in the U.S. Congress last week held a hearing with executives from Melvin Capital, online trading platform Robinhood, and a retail investor who calls himself “Roaring Kitty” and championed GameStop, sending its share price up some 1,700%.",Reuters

You can’t really mingle with colleagues, or dance with them, and it’s tough to get in the disco mood in your home office. On the other hand, you can’t spread disease, you don’t have to traipse home and there’s no chance of an ill-advised amorous encounter.In the COVID-19 era though, gala options are limited. Companies are turning to events organisers to create virtual social events for staff. And with working-from-home here to stay, some expect demand to continue even after the pandemic.After almost a year of doing her job from home, fintech worker Catharina Gehrke was finally able to get some proper office gossip in the virtual bathroom and smoking area at her company’s online Christmas party.The event she attended included a (virtual) taxi ride and dance floor, a Queen Elizabeth II impersonator, a cocktail-making class, plus (real) food and drink hampers delivered to the 200 party people - the staff stuck at home.“Although I was sitting alone in my living room, I really felt like I was at a party,” said Gehrke, who heads up the Swedish arm of online pet insurance company Bought By Many.Gehrke sampled everything the “venue” had to offer but said the highlight was getting some juicy office gossip in the privacy of the (virtual) bathroom - where, with a click of the mouse, she could decamp from the dance floor with a select group of friends.She said the event was one of the best work socials she’d been to, but added: “Maybe you just had to be there.”As work habits shift, the worldwide virtual events market is expected to grow from just under $100 billion in 2020 to $400 billion by 2027, according to data from Grand View Research.“Virtual socials are 100% here to stay, but combined with in-person events” said Rachel Haines, director of organisation and development at Swedish payments firm Klarna. “After all, I’d rather go yoga on the roof of our HQ than in my living room.”Klarna has made virtual socialising a core part of its corporate culture during the pandemic.“Many of our people are young and live alone,” Haines added. “Online socials are very important and we’ve pushed several big initiatives to make sure people are connected.”These initiatives include virtual Friday drinks, weeknight cookalongs and morning yoga. Klarna has even done a team-building activity where staff solve puzzles in order to break free from a virtual “escape room”, Haines said.‘A DOZEN SHOCKED FACES’The work-from-home experiment has been so successful in some sectors, like finance, that many people have no intention of reverting to type. Half of finance workers in Britain, for example, do not want to return to the office after COVID-19, according to consultancy firm KPMG.Edward Pollard, chief operating officer of events organiser Hire Space, said the surge in demand for online events during the pandemic had forced his company to innovate.“Clients now ask us for everything from virtual horse racing to cookery classes and networking events,” Pollard said.Yet, some workers aren’t quite so comfortable with the new order.“I was put on the spot with a solo verse at our virtual carol,” said Jake, a London-based charity worker. After warbling a few terrible notes, he turned off his camera and pretended the internet had cut out.“But the damage was done. I just remember a dozen shocked faces in a grid across my screen.”Or take the case of Sebastian Woods, who works for a machine learning company in Stockholm. He was somewhat thrown when his wife, who like him has been working from their flat, took part in a Friday night work social event.“I couldn’t concentrate on my excel spreadsheet because she was doing the Banana Dance at the kitchen table.”For a graphic story on what it may be like returning to the office, click: here",Reuters

That federal case has been combined with an antitrust case brought by states for pre-trial matters.The state case, which was filed in December, also accused Google of seeking to extend its dominance to devices like speakers, televisions and even smart cars.Google has denied wrongdoing in both cases.The federal case is expected to go to trial in September 2023.",Reuters

That margin suggested Democrats face an uphill climb in trying to convict the man who still remains popular with Republican voters.Oklahoma Senator James Lankford on Wednesday appeared emotional at his desk after Eric Swalwell, one of the House impeachment managers, finished his presentation. Another senator, Steve Daines, put his hand on Lankford’s arm in what appeared to be a gesture of comfort.But speaking to reporters later, Lankford struggled to connect the visceral images to any culpability for Trump, who in a fiery speech before the attack on the Capitol urged his supporters to “fight” his election defeat.“He’s had 100 rallies and we’ve never seen that before. So that’s the tough one to be able to link together,” Lankford said.Separately, Florida Senator Rick Scott said he was “disgusted” by the behavior of the rioters.But asked whether Trump bore responsibility, he said, “You know, I’ve watched what he said. He’s never said that somebody should break in. He actually said that people should do this peacefully ... Look, this is a complete waste of time.”Kansas Senator Jerry Moran called the videos “heart-wrenching.” But asked if he saw a link between the footage and Trump’s words, he said: “I’ll wait ‘til the conclusion of the trial.”Indiana Senator Mike Braun called the footage “riveting.”“But I don’t know that that’s going to make a difference for any one senator just having it on a loop again,” he said.Trump’s lawyer, Bruce Castor, agreed the House impeachment managers’ footage was emotional, but he seemed unworried about his client’s chances.“I believe it would have an emotional impact on any jury but ... and we haven’t played ours,” said Castor.",Reuters

While bitcoin is considered a commodity by U.S. financial regulators, most other cryptocurrencies have yet to be classified as commodities or securities.In December, Coinbase shut down trading in the XRP cryptocurrency, after the SEC charged associated blockchain firm Ripple with conducting an unregistered securities offering.The price of bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency ended 2020 up more than 300% and earlier this month hit a record high of $58,354 with a market capitalization above $1 trillion.Bitcoin has come off its recent highs this week as investors grew nervous at sky-high valuations.The filing provides the first detailed look at Coinbase’s finances since the San Francisco-based company was founded in 2012.It showed Coinbase in 2020 pulled in total revenue of $1.3 billion, up from $533.7 million in 2019. It reported net income of $322.3 million, swinging from a loss of $30.4 million.In the filing, Coinbase, which was valued at more than $8 billion in its last private fundraising round in 2018, did not disclose the date when it plans to list shares on Nasdaq. It also did not disclose the price at which its stock has been trading of late in private markets. This will serve as a pricing benchmark when it goes public on Nasdaq.Coinbase is eschewing a traditional initial public offering where a company raises money by selling new shares, opting instead to go public through a direct listing where no new stock is sold and existing shareholders can sell stock.It is among the most well-known cryptocurrency platforms globally, with more than 43 million users in more than 100 countries.The New York Stock Exchange, BBVA and ex-Citigroup Inc chief executive Vikram Pandit are among those that have invested in Coinbase.Coinbase said in December that it had confidentially applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public.

Before COVID-19, visits to Greece's paper-strewn labour offices were a ordeal of queues and case files, often for basic matters that in less than a year have moved online as the pandemic upended old administrative routines.
FEB 25 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greece-modernisation/pandemic-eu-billions-drive-greeces-digital-revolution-idUSKBN2AP204,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Before COVID-19, visits to Greece’s paper-strewn labour offices were a ordeal of queues and case files, often for basic matters that in less than a year have moved online as the pandemic upended old administrative routines.“Essentially overnight, two thirds of the visits were no longer necessary,” said Spiros Protopsaltis, head of OAED, the Organization of Employment and Unemployment Insurance.Crammed with thousands of folders and blue OAED registration cards spilling out onto desks and floor space, the corridors of the building where he spoke still offer a daunting vision of the challenge to overhauling public services in Greece.But conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says he is determined to harness the pandemic to “leapfrog” other countries with green and digital reforms to change everything from energy to education.Greece has long been an online laggard, languishing at the bottom of the European Union’s digital economy rankings, but shifts forced by the pandemic and billions of euros from the EU’s Recovery Fund may accelerate change.Around 6 billion euros ($7.34 billion), a fifth of the 32 billion in EU recovery funds that Greece will receive, has been earmarked for the transition. Some 400 projects, from fibre optic networks to reinforcing cybersecurity and improving skills have been outined in a 2020-25 “Digital Transformation Bible”.“If we can do everything we’ve planned in the recovery, it will be truly transformational,” Mitsotakis told Reuters in an interview.Similar promises of transformation have been heard before however and years of encrusted bureaucracy as well as a debt crisis that decimated investment will not be swept away easily.According to a 2019 OECD report, two thirds of Greeks believe they deserve better treatment from state services, which for many, mean dispiriting visits to rundown offices where case files can disappear for years.Public offices only stopped using fax machines at the start of this year; high speed internet connection is not a given and ancient box-sized computers running on 1990s software are common.“We still use pens to write,” said Dimitris, a public sector manager planning to retire after 44 years, who did not want to give his last name in case it complicated the battle he faces to claim his pension.“There are certain prerequisites for Greece to leapfrog as it needs, because right now it lags behind in most metrics,” said Nikos Vettas, head of the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE) thinktank.As well as 5G infrastructure, overhauling public sector management and education reforms to improve digital skills were vital. “If you combine all this then you could have a significant positive effect on GDP growth,” he said.Pressure to shake up public services had grown as successive governments battled through the decade-long debt crisis and eye-catching initiatives, such as a unified e-government services platform, have followed.“Even before the pandemic, 80% of our services were digital,” said George Pitsilis, head of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue who says he wants to eliminate any reason to come to a tax office.“Of course the pandemic was an accelerator,” he said from one of the authority’s modernized Athens offices where video calls have largely replaced in-person visits.In other areas, progress has been slower.For many pensioners, claiming retirement benefits involves long sessions with an official using paper and a calculator to work out how successive reforms - there were at least 13 during the financial crisis - have affected their entitlements.Many claims are delayed for years and a target to get 80% of the system online this year appears ambitious. “Getting a pension in Greece is a nightmare,” sighed Dimitris, the retiring public servant.But other signs are more hopeful. The government points to investment plans from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon and, although many older people do not use a computer, smartphone features like an e-prescription service launched as the pandemic erupted have proved a hit.From 1,500 people registered when it opened, there are now around 1.6 million users and nearly a quarter of drug prescriptions are issued online.“The good thing with digital transformation is you don’t necessarily need lots of physical capital,” said Vettas. “You need human capital and in that regard one can be optimistic Greece can transform.”",Reuters

Facebook Inc on Thursday launched a campaign to explain to users how small businesses depend on personalized advertising, ahead of upcoming plans by Apple Inc to prompt iPhone users to allow apps to use their data for ads.
FEB 25 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-advertising/facebook-promotes-value-of-personalized-ads-in-new-campaign-idUSKBN2AP1UZ,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Thursday launched a campaign to explain to users how small businesses depend on personalized advertising, ahead of upcoming plans by Apple Inc to prompt iPhone users to allow apps to use their data for ads.The campaign called “Good Ideas Deserve To Be Found” highlights several advertisers that have grown their business on Facebook and Instagram, such as Houston-based fashion brand House of Takura. A commercial will air on TV, including during the Golden Globe Awards this Sunday, Facebook said.The campaign to convince users to warm up to ads comes as Facebook, which faces several U.S. antitrust lawsuits, has accused Apple of anti-competitive behavior in using its control of the App Store to limit app developers’ collection of user data from other apps.Facebook’s ad spending behind the campaign is in the millions of dollars, according to a source familiar with the matter.Facebook generates revenue from ads and through fees for businesses using a feature that lets customers purchase directly within Facebook and Instagram. Facebook said it will continue to waive those fees through June.The social media giant said Thursday it will launch an Instagram sticker and Facebook hashtag “DeserveToBeFound” to let small businesses share and publicize their offerings across the platforms.It will also simplify its Ads Manager, a self-serve tool that lets brands buy and create Facebook ads, to make it easier for small businesses to use.Annette Njau, founder of House of Takura, said personalized ads have been essential to expanding her brand, which sells handbags made in Africa. She said 85% of her sales so far this year have come from Facebook.“I had my Facebook and Instagram pages before I had a website,” Njau said. “I like that I can be responsive to (customer) questions and the fact that I can be right there.”",Reuters

San Francisco-based Affirm Holdings Inc said on Thursday that it is planning to launch its first payment card allowing users to pay for some purchases in installments, as the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector booms.
FEB 25 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-affirm-card/affirm-to-launch-buy-now-pay-later-debit-card-idUSKBN2AP1UQ,"(Reuters) - San Francisco-based Affirm Holdings Inc said on Thursday that it is planning to launch its first payment card allowing users to pay for some purchases in installments, as the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector booms.Founded in 2012, Affirm has become one of the most well known buy now, pay later firms in the United States, giving consumers the option to easily spread payments for online purchases.Companies in the sector, including Sweden’s Klarna and Australia’s Afterpay, have seen business blossom over the past year as consumers shopped online more during the pandemic.Affirm’s card, which it expects to be available later this year, will allow shoppers to split the cost of some in-store purchases over a period of time, but they can still choose to pay up front as with a normal debit card.The card will offer interest-free and simple interest-bearing loans, said CEO Max Levchin, adding that more than a third of U.S. consumers have used a BNPL service with debit transactions accounting for 30% of all payments.“Yet, there is no card that currently allows consumers to make the choice between paying upfront or over time. We thought it would be very powerful to combine the two,” he said.Management consultants Oliver Wyman estimate BNPL firms facilitated between $20 billion-25 billion in transactions in the United States last year, but some regulators are concerned that spreading payment encourages customers to spend more than they can afford.Affirm’s revenue rose 57% to $204 million in the second quarter of its 2021 fiscal year. It allows shoppers to split spread purchases over periods ranging from six weeks to four years, with interest rates of 0 to 30%.",Reuters

India's largest brokerage Zerodha is facing a backlash from traders who saw their equity positions abruptly closed during an exchange glitch, amidst criticism that a lack of communication from the country's top bourse caused losses.
FEB 25 2021",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-exchange-brokers/indias-top-brokerage-zerodha-faces-investor-fury-after-stock-exchange-glitch-idUSKBN2AP1MD,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s largest brokerage Zerodha is facing a backlash from traders who saw their equity positions abruptly closed during an exchange glitch, amidst criticism that a lack of communication from the country’s top bourse caused losses.The National Stock Exchange (NSE) suddenly shut down for nearly four hours on Wednesday, blindsiding traders. As the NSE did not swiftly update whether, and when, it would reopen, brokers began closing intra-day equity positions on another exchange later, leading to sharp losses for some investors.Hundreds of traders who bought stocks via Zerodha, dubbed the Robinhood platform of India, voiced concern on Twitter, with many posting pictures showing portfolio losses due to trades squared off by the broker.Many signed an online petition calling for strict action.“My 6 months salary has gone...I’ll sue you in court,” said Twitter user Aashish Kumar, who posted a snapshot of his Zerodha account showing a trading loss of 211,777 rupees ($2,922).Other traditional brokerages that rely more on relationship managers and take trade orders from clients via telephone also resorted to similar risk mitigation strategies on Wednesday, traders said, but criticism of Zerodha was most vocal.Zerodha revolutionized stock trading with its discounted offerings and easy-to-use smartphone apps in India. Today, it says it is the country’s largest brokerage with more than 4 million clients, accounting for 15% of daily retail trading volume.Zerodha declined to comment, while the NSE did not respond to a request for comment.While the episode has put Zerodha and some other brokerages at the centre of a firestorm, market experts say NSE was more to blame and brokers have their hands tied in such situations.“Brokers had no option but to square off their clients’ positions..., otherwise they would have had to face a margin requirement,” said Shriram Subramaniam, a corporate governance expert and founder of proxy advisory InGovern.In a letter to the market regulator on Thursday, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India, which represents major brokers, said “huge monetary loss” to investors could have been prevented if NSE had communicated swiftly.The NSE on Wednesday announced that it had shut at 11:40 a.m. local time after a telecom glitch. Zerodha said NSE did not share updates on any possible reopening and so it “squared off all” equity intra-day positions at 3:10 p.m on another Indian exchange.Just around 7 minutes later, NSE announced it would reopen, but it was too late for many. Zerodha said in a blog post it would not have taken the risk mitigation measures if NSE had informed brokers of a potential reopening in advance.Zerodha’s website states intraday square-off timings can change at the discretion of its risk management team.Still, Satish Madhav Giri, 30, pinned the blame on Zerodha, saying its measures inflicted a loss of about 10,000 rupees ($138) on his trade.“I couldn’t do anything. We didn’t know exactly what’s happening. Zerodha had full control. We couldn’t do anything.”In a statement early on Thursday, the NSE said the telecom issue affected its online risk management system and it was analyzing the incident.",Reuters

President Joe Biden promised he would never politicize the U.S. military as he made his first visit to the Pentagon as commander-in-chief on Wednesday, seeking to draw a contrast with the Trump-era in a far-reaching speech that emphasized diversity in the armed forces.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-defense/in-pentagon-debut-biden-promises-break-from-trump-era-politicization-of-military-idUSKBN2AA2X2,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden promised he would never politicize the U.S. military as he made his first visit to the Pentagon as commander-in-chief on Wednesday, seeking to draw a contrast with the Trump-era in a far-reaching speech that emphasized diversity in the armed forces.Biden, whose late son, Beau, was a soldier who deployed to Iraq, bristled at former President Donald Trump’s approach to the military during the presidential campaign, including a report that Trump once privately called American soldiers killed during World War One “losers” and “suckers.”Critics say Trump openly flouted norms of behavior in open pursuit of political support among U.S. troops, who are meant to be loyal to the U.S. Constitution - not any party or political movement.“I will never ever dishonor you, I will never disrespect you, I will never politicize the work you do,” Biden said from the Pentagon briefing room.He added: “This is personal for me. The Biden family is a military family.”Pentagon leadership is under pressure to show progress in combating white nationalism and other extremism in the ranks, after current and former military service members were found to have participated in the pro-Trump siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.On Tuesday, the U.S. Navy’s top admiral condemned two racist incidents involving hate symbols on warships, which sources said included a noose that was left on a Black sailor’s bed.Biden made history by naming retired Army general Lloyd Austin the first Black U.S. defense secretary. In his Pentagon address on Wednesday, Biden stressed other groundbreaking achievements by Black soldiers, from pilots who fought in World War Two to soldiers who fought in the Civil War.“Right now, more than 40 percent of our active duty forces are people of color. Now it’s long past time that the full diversity and full strength of our forces are reflected at every level of this department,” Biden said.Still, discrimination persists in the U.S. military.Reuters was first to report last month that nearly a third of Black U.S. military service members indicated that they experienced racial discrimination, harassment or both during a 12-month period, according to a Defense Department survey that was withheld during much of the Trump administration.During his first days in office, Biden signed an executive order that overturned a ban Trump on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military.Biden noted that Austin, upon taking over as defense secretary, ordered a review of sexual assault cases.“This administration ... is dedicated to ensuring that every single person is treated with dignity and respect,” Biden said.Biden’s visit, which included a tour of a Pentagon exhibition honoring Black service members, sharply contrasted with Trump’s Pentagon debut in 2017. Trump used the opportunity to sign an executive order prohibiting refugees from Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.Still, it left many questions unanswered about Biden’s approach to the Pentagon as speculation mounts about potential cuts to defense spending, the two-decade-old war in Afghanistan, future U.S. deployments to the Middle East and Asia and tensions with Iran.Biden announced plans for a Pentagon review of strategy toward China but there was no sign for now of any shift in the U.S. approach.Biden was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman, the first Black American and the first Asian American to hold the second highest U.S. office.Harris paid tribute to barrier-breaking Black servicemembers.“They didn’t just join to make history. They joined to serve,” she said.",Reuters

1169,Biden administration asks U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Obamacare law,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-obamacare/biden-administration-asks-u-s-supreme-court-to-uphold-obamacare-law-idUSKBN2AA2QA,"(Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s administration on Wednesday told the U.S. Supreme Court that the Obamacare healthcare law should be upheld, reversing the position taken by the government under his Republican predecessor Donald Trump.The court in November held oral arguments in a bid by Republican-governed states led by Texas to invalidate the Affordable Care Act, as the 2010 law is formally known. Trump’s administration had sided with the states challenging Obamacare. A ruling is due by the end of June.Biden’s administration notified the court of the government’s new position in a letter filed by Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler.The case represents the latest Republican legal attack on Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. Republicans failed numerous times to repeal it in Congress, and Trump’s administration took steps to hobble the law.Biden, who was Obama’s vice president when the law was enacted, has promised to protect and build on Obamacare, which has enabled millions of Americans to obtain health insurance by expanding public healthcare programs and creating marketplaces for private insurance. Republicans have called it a government overreach.The position reversal at the Supreme Court was expected considering Biden’s public statements on Obamacare, and Kneedler said there is no need for further legal briefing before the court decides the case. The law had been defended in the case by Democratic-led states and the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.At the heart of the case is whether a provision of the law called the “individual mandate” that required Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a financial penalty was lawful. The Republican challengers had argued that the mandate was unconstitutional and that, as a result, the entire law should be struck down.Kneedler told the court that the government “no longer adheres to the conclusions in the previously filed brief” submitted by Trump’s administration. The Biden administration believes that the individual mandate was constitutional and, even if it was not, the rest of the law should remain in place, Kneedler added.During the argument in November, it appeared unlikely the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, would strike down the entire law.",Reuters
